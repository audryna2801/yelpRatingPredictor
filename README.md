# The Yelp Rating Predictor

Hello and welcome to our final CMSC 12200 project: "The Yelp Rating Predictor"!

Our goal for this project was to create a program that predicts a Yelp rating (out of 5 stars) for a review using the Linear SVM model. First, we will be going into what each file does and how it contributes to the overarching goal of the project. Then, a short introduction on how to use the program. And lastly, we will evaluate the scope of what our project can do and the limitations that come with it.
