      "Enter review here: This NYC gem was just a magical birthday celebration evening. NYC opened indoor dining back up to 25% and as I write this, it is now at 35%.  We cannot lose these places...this is what makes New York, New York. I hope that we can all get through this pandemic and keep these gems alive.  As I was saying... You will not be disappointed at all! Every dish created by CHEF PROPRIETOR KAY HYUN & team was MAGICAL!  The flavors, the combination, the textures. Beautiful tapas sized plates were shared amongst my group.  It is an art and every bite should take you on a rollercoaster ride.  My kids are 10 + 8 years old and I'm so grateful they were able to experience this journey through all the different plates. They loved it and had a better understanding of each one.\n",

But as a huge fried chicken fan - this didn't quite cut the mustard not to mention the price point was pretty high.  I shared some bites with my friends and they were into it: they're not fried chicken addicts like me, so there's that.\n",
