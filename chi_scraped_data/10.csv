5,"We tried this place on the recommendation of our Uber driver. It didn&apos;t disappoint!  The appetizer, local beer, and deep dish pizza were all wonderful. We added basil to the crust and it was just amazing. Everyone should stop by. 

They were COVID conscious. Felt very safe eating here."
5,"We wanted to visit Chicago last year but due to the pandemic, we couldn&apos;t. So a few days ago, I ordered from Tastes of Chicago and had six 9&quot; deep dish pizzas sent to me in California. I figured even though we weren&apos;t able to travel there, at least we could have a taste of what deep dish pizza is like from Chicago.

We tried the veggie and pepperoni pizzas and the butter crust was very good! Someday I would like to try it at their restaurant but this will do for now."
5,"I recently ordered delivery via their web site...delivery was fast, hot, and nicely packaged.

I read that they recommend that you do NOT have your PIZZA CUT at the restaurant so that it travels better....I followed the advice and completely agree!

I ordered the Spinach and Tomato thin crust pizza which had the same buttery taste as the deep dish pizza, was piled high with fresh, gourmet toppings and cheese....I cannot wait to order it again REAL SOON!

I also ordered the Buffalo Wings which were a mixture of pieces.  Moist and large in size.  They also came with celery and ranch dressing or blue cheese.

I love supporting local businesses that are family run and this is definitely a true Chicago treasure!"
5,"This was one of the most delicious meals we&apos;ve had from a restaurant in a while! 
We called in our order an hour ahead since we were driving through Chicago and it was ready when we arrived and still warm. The ladies at the front were very sweet. 

We ordered the small Lou deep dish pizza and the medium Malnati salad to share. 
The Lou pizza was so full of flavor with the mushrooms, cheese and basil. 
The salad was fresh and also so full of flavor. 

We&apos;ll definitely be back to try the other pizzas and salads!"
2,"I was told between Lou Malnati&apos;s and Giordanos - these are the best pizza joints in Chicago. The number of reviews was impressive.
I was disappointed with both. This pizza reminded me of pizza I had in grade school. It was just purely boring. I cannot fathom the hype. I came to the conclusion that I am a fan of Chicago style pizza but not Chicago Pizza. The waitress was friendly, sociable and politically aware. 

Overall it tasted like, &quot;Its not delivery. It&apos;s Digiorno&apos;s!&quot;"
4,"This is going to be an odd review because it&apos;s not about the pizza. We ordered only the Malnati&apos;s Salad and the Calamari ^.^ This is my second time eating the salad and it was just as I remembered it the first time. I think it might be the best salad I have ever eaten. Something about the lemon vinaigrette, salami bits, and fresh tomatoes that make the salad soooooo good!!!! The salami bits! I just want to eat it by myself but the medium definitely serves 2-3 person. The calamari was very tasty too with a splash of lemon. The breading was delicious. 
I have tried the deep dish before and I remember it being good. I&apos;m more of a garlic butter crust Pizza Hut kind of girl though."
3,"While visiting Chicago, we definitely wanted to try deep dish pizza. Lou Manalti&apos;s was in walking distance from our hotel, so we decided to try it. When we visited at beginning of November, restaurants could only have customers eat outside due to CoVid which was great because the weather was beautiful. We went at lunchtime and luckily a table was available. 

We started off with the garlic bread which was a nice appetizer while we waited for our pizzas to be cooked. I&apos;m glad we did because the bread was soft and delicious with the perfect amount of garlic and butter.

Regarding the pizza, I liked that they offered personal sizes. This is perfect when you have a large group or when people have different preferences or dietary needs. There were three of us in our group and we each decided to order a personal size. I ordered the deep dish cheese with peppers and onions, and decided to pay extra for the buttercrust. To me, it was the perfect size, I even had left overs. The pizza was good, my only complaints were that I wish that it had more taste and the sauce seemed a little watery. Looking back, I wish that I had added a meat. This probably would have added the taste that I was looking for. Also, maybe if the onions and peppers had been cut a little larger, this probably would have added flavor."
5,"I&apos;m not too crazy about pizza, but this place is not your average pizza. Personally I&apos;ve always loved thin crust pizza, but after having this deep dish pizza I may have to change my mind. They offer the option to split your pizza in half in terms of toppings/flavoring so I decided I wanted to try their top recommended pizzas. And I absolutely loved the Lou even though there was no meat in that pizza. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to make but well worth the wait. The crust and the bottom of the pizza is perfectly crispy, while the contents of the cheese and everything is full of flavor. It&apos;s just a really solid pizza and by far my favorite pizza place. I&apos;ve had pizza in New York and in Texas, but hands down if I&apos;m ever back in Chicago this is the place I&apos;ll be at for pizza."
5,"Okay, I&apos;m from NYC and the pizza and salad blew my expectations. My friends and I got a small deep dish and the Malnati salad and got it delivered to our hotel and I wasn&apos;t expecting much because it was delivered. 

But wow the pizza wasn&apos;t even hot and that&apos;s when you know the food is delicious when its tasty when it&apos;s not hot. 

Also the salad people... one of the best salads Iv&apos;e had in my life hands down. As a new yorker I take pride in a lot of food in NY especially pizza, but this place is a must go."
4,"Ordered for delivery to my hotel. Easy ordering, delivered quickly, was at the right temperature, and they even brought me a plate, silverware, pepper flakes and Parmesan! I ordered a personal deep dish and it was good. I highly recommend getting the butter crust because you can taste the difference. It came with lots of cheese and abundant toppings. The tomato sauce was bland though. It tasted like it&apos;s missing something like maybe some salt? That&apos;s why I gave it only 4/5 stars. Overall it was a good pizza and I&apos;d highly recommend!"
4,"First time in Chicago, of course I had to try a deep dish pizza. Yelped it and decided to try this place. On a weekday lunch, got seated immediately outside. I had the smallest deep dish original pizza. They warned me it would take 20-30 minutes and I said fine. The best things in life cannot come easy.

The pizza was not bad. It was cheesy, tasty, crunchy ends. Staff was polite and prompt."
1,"In town and yelp suggested this place for a deep dish pizza. It was a Friday night around 8, it was a 45min wait. Fine I anticipated that. We sit down the waitress tells us if we want pizza to let her know soon because it takes 45min to cook it. So we ordered that first, with cheese break, and a salad, and lous chicken pasta. 
Bread was ok, salad was good. On to the main dishes. The pizza was subpar. Very thin crust, I almost didn&apos;t even know it had a crust at the bottom and not much cheese. Now the pasta. They said they make homemade sauce, there&apos;s no way! The creamy sauce tasted like a canned sauce with cheese added. It have zero flavor, not much chicken at all. It was horrible. 
So glad the next night we went to Giordano&apos;s their pizza redeemed my deep fish pizza reviews."
5,"The best deep dish pizza in Chicago...it&apos;s the crust for me! 
The lemon pepper wings were so good, that we placed an order to go. 
If you&apos;ve never tried deep dish pizza and can&apos;t decide if you want to go to Giordano&apos;s or Lou Malnati&apos;s, pick Lou Malnati&apos;s, they won&apos;t disappoint you."
1,"Worst pizza ever. Flavorless sauce. Cardboard tasting dough. Soggy steamed vegetables, flavorless as well. 

We waited more than 2 hours due to covid and we didn&apos;t mind because this place was being praised by everyone. 

We ordered a large Lou, a large Chicagoan and a small cheese pizza to really get the feel for the flavors. 

All of them tasted exactly the same. Garbage. 

I definitely do not recommend this place to anyone.

Go to Pequods."
4,"First time in Chicago and everyone from friends to my uber driver were telling me to try this place if I wanted a good deep-dish pizza. Now I&apos;m completely basic when it comes to pizza preferences so I will say coming to this place did not turn me into a deep dish fanatic but I definitely enjoyed my meal. There was a ridiculous wait but they allow you to order your food while waiting for a table. I was able to get my table pretty quickly because I was solo dolo. My pie consisted of half of the Chicago Classic &amp; half of The Lou (only way I could do this is if I ordered the size up from the personal). Both were so good but definitely couldn&apos;t finish it so I took it back to my hotel for the next day (tasted better than the day before). 

Overall I can say I&apos;ve had Chicago deep dish pizza!"
4,"My first night in Chicago I knew I had to try deep dish and luckily Lou Malnati&apos;s was right around the corner from my Airbnb. We got the Lou&apos;s without mushrooms.

The pie came out within maybe 30 minutes of being seated and 30 minutes of waiting on a table. The small was $19, but it makes sense considering the time and ingrediants they put into their pizzas. I thought the layering was great and the tomato chunks were a great touch. 
The staff were accommodating for us first timers and the ambience was great for a date or just hanging out with friends. They were very clean and wore masks. 
I can&apos;t wait for my next trip to Chicago!"
5,"BEST  PIZZA  EVER.

I looked up several reviews for this place and all of the good ones aren&apos;t wrong at all.

I drove out here on a food trip and it didn&apos;t disappoint. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for the following reasons:

Cleanliness: they do a good job with social distancing by limiting the seating in doors and spacing the seating outdoors. All employees I saw had masks on and they encouraged me to wait outside for my pizza.

Service: the time they quoted me was spot on (35 minutes) and the hostesses brought it out to me. I felt special!

Taste: this is my favorite thing to report on because the pizza was memorable! The crust was thick and buttery. The fresh cheese (from neighboring Wisconsin) was spot on! Hot and gooey. The sausage and other toppings were layered on next. Then the incredible tomato sauce. Savory, slightly chunky, and married all of the ingredients together.

I&apos;ll try their competitors one day I&apos;m back in Chicago, but for now, Lou Malnati&apos;s is the BEST in my opinion. I highly recommend this place. #HastyFoodiePic"
3,"A lot of people in Chicago love this place, yes the pizza is good, but it isn&apos;t the best comparing to other pizza places in the city."
4,"---Pre-Covid Review---
My first Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago, though not my last thanks to the Chicago Pizza Tour (seriously look them up, they&apos;re great)! Made this our tourist pick of the trip and came by on a Thursday for an early lunch. I really needed this to go well. I&apos;ve tried deep dish pizza a few times out in California and they were all pretty terrible. 

Ordered 2 personal pizzas which was about the right amount for a light/medium sized lunch for my friend &amp; I. Between the two I preferred the Lou. The classic is good and I did enjoy the sausage but the Lou just has more going on. 

General impressions:
-Great sauce! I&apos;m all about that acidity and they got it
-Buttery cracker like crust around the edges that goes super well w/ the cheese that&apos;s gotten extra baked on.
-There&apos;s plenty of toppings but not enough cheese. I am a cheese fiend and I want cheese pull in every bite.
-Good sausage w/ great flavors

Overall I&apos;ve concluded the California deep dish pizza is trash. I&apos;m sorry for ever doubting that it could actually be good. That being said, is it better than NY pizza? Not for me at least. Between the price and the wait time and general ratios, I&apos;d still go for a slice of NY pizza anyday but I do enjoy the more calm, sit-down experience of deep dish too and Lou Malnati&apos;s is a solid spot (big surprise there...)"
5,"Oh what a pizza pie it is.    We live in Minneapolis but order Lou Malnatis pizza online.   This is classic Chicago Pizza.   We had a seminar with Lou&apos;s and I learned we build our pizza backward.  Put the cheese down and then the sauce.  The cheese helps protect the crust.   Also, hit the pizza pan with a little oil and once it&apos;s hot out the oizza dough in and it will give it a crispy crust.   

These are hallmarks of the pizza.  Order a box of six and you can have Lou&apos;s anytime!   Our favorites are cheese and sausage.  Cost is roughly the same as if you ordered takeout.    Love this pizza!
