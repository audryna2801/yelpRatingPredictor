5,"Come get brunch here!! 

I was excited to find a vegetarian/vegan brunch+lunch spot. Masks are required to enter. Outdoor seating is the only option available based on the current Covid restrictions. The outdoor tables had individual overhead heating lamps. They didn&apos;t produce much heat. My hands ended up being pretty cold. So, beware and come fully bundled up!! 

The waitress maintained social distancing precautions! Masks are required when the waiter or waitress comes to the table and whenever you get up from the table. I liked that these rules were explained by the host right after being seated. 

The menu has SO many options providing a majority of the same options in either a vegetarian or vegan way. Best of both worlds. 

I ordered the vegan breakfast burrito and French toast. 

The vegan breakfast was filled with seitan chorizo, peppers, onions, potato, avocado, cilantro, and spinach. The burrito was also paired with salsa verde &amp; black beans. The seitan had a powerful savory flavor that paired amazingly with the roasted peppers. Great smoky, meaty flavor. The side of black beans did not disappoint! Great texture and good mixture of flavors. 

The French toast was topped with fresh strawberries and banana as well as powdered sugar. The French toast can be prepared vegan. I ordered the non-vegan version. The French toast was lightly browned and crispy on the outside with a creamy, soft inside. It wasn&apos;t soggy or too eggy which I appreciated. It had a nice cinnamon sugar/custard taste to it. 

I recommend both of these food items! I&apos;m looking forward to coming back and trying more from the menu!"
5,"Food: 5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5
 
Food: This might be my favorite Vegan restaurant in Chicago !! The have both vegan and vegetarian options for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner! At this point I&apos;ve tried so many items but my favorite might be the Vegan Chimichanga! The Vegan pancakes are also crazyyyy good! Oh and the vegan chili cheese fries ;)

Atmosphere: After reading everything I just said about this place, you might not expect it to look the way it does. You walk into a bar and the restaurant is in the back. I was kind of thrown for a loop. Nonetheless, the patio is cozy and they have heated lamps outside to accommodate during the pandemic. The service is very very good!"
5,Long overdue review from a happy little veg head. This is the SPOT. Bomb food. Everything I&apos;ve ever ordered from this place has been amazing. Nachos &amp; Buffalo chick&apos;n wrap being two of my favs. Staff is super sweet and I love the little patio in the back. Last time I won a free t shirt lol
5,"Incredible. This restaurant made my vegan chimichanga dreams come true like I never knew possible. 
I usually cook all my meals at home so tonight was a special gift to myself to order out and I had a true craving for a chimichanga. I used to eat them a lot before going vegetarian, so I was nervous about finding a good one around, particularly hoping for vegan! So after a bit of searching I came across this one. I was so sad because it said they stopped serving them at 3pm. I felt defeated until 5 minutes later when I read on the menu that the Monday special is chimi&apos;s ALL DAY!!!! It was a god send!!! I quickly ordered one and rushed over and let me tell you.. I could live off this for a week. It&apos;s HUGE! I ate a 4th and was already wanting to tap out but couldn&apos;t stop myself til i hit the halfway mark and had no choice. The guacamole is amazing and the vegan cheese is a showstopper. I&apos;d give it 6 stars if I could. Thank you Handlebar this is the bomb!!!! 
(ps- this should be on the dinner menu everyday!!)"
1,"Ordered 2 breakfast burritos.  They should have it named a spinach burrito because it was 30% potato, egg and chorizo and 70% spinach.   

If you like eating leaves instead of a breakfast burrito, this place is for you.

If you are a normal person and want to have a real breakfast sandwich, go elsewhere. 

May I add - the far-left Liberal propaganda all over your windows alienates potential customers. 

Very disappointing experience."
4,"Gotta love these hipster places, am I right? They have a sense of some culture, and they blow it up like a wall size poster. However, this poster is designed to look like a delicious assortment of vegetarian and vegan cuisine only few can perfectly craft.

Handlebar is set on a mission, it seems. They want to attract an audience with no general clue on just how incredible faux meat can really taste. Case in point: their sloppy joe made with soy beef. An unbelievable texture that measures only up to the real thing. Can you believe food like this can taste so good? Then you have their specialty Tofu dish, filled with hearty cut pieces of tofu drenched in peanut sauce, alongside broccoli, edamame, mushrooms, and brown rice it&apos;s a legendary party in your mouth.

With items like this on their menu, you know there&apos;s a fire bar waiting to serve some brews and cocktails. Patio seating in the back are open even during these late winter days. Also there&apos;s a breakfast/brunch menu I need to try out.

Underrated spot for some delicious health conscious food. Cannot recommend enough"
5,"Handlebar was a delightful little spot for a tasty brunch date. We came for the bloodies, FYI, and they didn&apos;t disappoint. The bloody mary came with a fried pickle - yum! - and a beer back chaser. Their house-made bloody mix was robust; some great flavor there! We ordered food as well. They had a nice array of choices which was really tasty and hit the spot. 

We had a great time while spending the weekend in Chicago. Cheers!"
4,"I&apos;d been eyeing Handlebar for a while now.. thanks to the show Easy and me wanting to cut more meat from my diet. 

I went in for a weekend brunch. Weather was beautiful and the patio was spacious enough to seat us right away. I ordered the roasted mushroom omelette &amp; tried the vegan diablos. My omelette was pretty tasty and since I&apos;m a huge sucker for mushrooms, it was right up my alley. However, the vegan diablos made me want to switch my plates .. the sauce in this dish was so flavorful &amp; I highly recommend! 

Service was attentive as well, space was pretty &amp; busy and they followed all guidelines for covid - masks, sanitizer.. you know the drill by now. 

I&apos;d be back to try more."
5,"The IDEAL patio restaurant for COVID-19-friendly dining! Masks are required when away form your table and when you are talking to servers. Max 4 in a party and at a table to keep much of the space open.

As for the food - oh my. I am obsessed with this place and I&apos;ve just moved to Chicago. We ordered the black bean tostadas, the nachos, and the sloppy joe sandwich. The tostadas with the vegan cheese was so flavorful and had textures that made my mouth happy. The nachos were HUMUNGOUS  and was perfectly portioned. The sloppy joe reminded us of our childhood, only more environmentally friendly. I loved the fries too; they were thin and salty and were perfect."
5,"Stopped in to Handlebar on Sunday for brunch.  They set up the outside and they are Covid ready also, have ample power and heaters to handle things on mild winter days.  The food was absolutely amazing.  We had the chilaquiles and fries to start, very nice.  I had a fish dish with a couple sides.  We took a slice of cake to go.  Another hidden gem in Chicago."
5,"I love Handlebar &amp; everything they have to offer. The ability to satisfy my cravings for a quick bit &amp; still convince my son to eat with me is unmeasurable. I ordered the Chili Mac Attack to share with the table, as well as the Nashville &quot;Chicken&quot; sandwich. He ordered the Sloppy Joe Sandwich &amp; my son ordered Grilled Fish Tacos. Every meal was consumed with no major complaints..my son&apos;s fish tacos were quite mushy &amp; I would even go so far to say not grilled well. But please don&apos;t let one off dish deter you from trying handlebar. The vegan selection of dishes are the best I&apos;ve had in Wicker Park &amp; the bartenders are great as well."
4,"I came to visit a friend for the day in Chicago and she couldn&apos;t stop raving about Handlebar so I had to give it a try! My eyes were definitely hungrier when looking at the menu because I couldn&apos;t even finish all the food I ordered. I ordered the nachos which came with seitan chorizo (almost couldn&apos;t tell the difference) which was packaged super neatly and it was even more fun having to assemble them myself. My friend also said that I HAD to get the Pie, Pie My Darling cake which this weekend, it was the Hocus Pocus cake. UNBELIEVABLE. So moist and decadent! They also are taking precautions with COVID as they have a pick up window instead!"
4,"I&apos;ve ordered delivery from Handlebar about three times since March. I&apos;ve gotten a different dish every time and each one was unique in flavor. The Nashville Hot Fried &quot;Chicken&quot; sandwich had just the right amount of spice to it. Their Green Meanie is a simple but FULL OF FLAVOR sandwich. Whatever juices and goods they got in it = my taste buds like it. Black Bean Maduro is my favorite out of the three meals I&apos;ve tried. The sweetness of the plantains and spicey chipotle sauce they give mixes well together.

Their side of fries are fine. I was not a huge fan of their vegan mac attack. Felt that it could&apos;ve used more flavor. Their Oatmeal Cream Pies hit the spot!!!! Highly recommend! They also carry Pie Pie My Darling cake slices. I was lucky enough to try a few and I&apos;ve been a fan for a bit!"
5,"Love Handlebar! Great for vegans and meat-eaters and everyone in between. Super diverse menu that&apos;s got something for everyone. Plus the vibe is awesome. Punk dive for all sorts of people. 

Menu highlights include: 
- Pepita scramble (tofu for vegans and eggs for others), super nutty and delicious and satisfying, and comes with a potatoes and toast 
- Seared ahi sandwich for non-vegans, huge and delicious, ahi is cooked perfectly every time 
- diablos (seitan chorizo and tofu for vegans, friend eggs for others), rice, beans, cheese and hand pressed tostadas, so satisfying 
- vegan cheese fries, literally could not believe this wasn&apos;t cheese and I don&apos;t say that lightly"
5,These were the best nachos I&apos;ve ever had! I&apos;m still in shock that everything was vegan. The nachos were made with switch chorizo and the Nashville &quot;chicken&quot; was made with mushroom but I swear you couldn&apos;t tell. Every bite was packed with flavor. I love that they&apos;re not shy about their serving of guacamole either! Definitely will be going back to this place quite often to try everything they have. Great outdoor social distances patio as well! I&apos;m a straight carnivore but I would go vegan if it tasted like this everyday
5,"Handlebar during quarantine - 
PATIO IS OPEN and I went yesterday! Of course I got the fried avocado grilled cheese (fire) and a slice of cake to share! The patio is open and clean and empty, no wait at all. The food was out SO fast and is SO tasty as usual."
5,Such a great experience at the Handlebar!!!!!  The food is phenomenal and they love pretty quickly.  I had a phenomenal blackened catfish that omg can EASILY put up against many fine eateries in Chicago.  Come in and enjoy.
3,"My wife chose this restaurant because of the vegan options. The place was quaint with a gritty interior. The service was standard. We ordered our food and it was ready in the expected amount of time. My wife was not thrilled with her avocado tacos. She kind of just picked over them. I on the other hand am not too particular. My shrimp and grits were alright. I&apos;ve had delicious shrimp and grits in the south, so the bar is set pretty high. The sweet potato chips were over done. I don&apos;t know if you can tell in the photo due to the low lighting. All in all not a terrible place to dine with vegan entrees."
5,"This place has some of the best vegan / vegetarian food I&apos;ve had in a long time. Everything there was excellent. I got the fried avocado grilled cheese, which wasn&apos;t too soggy but was thicker than expected so had a nice outside crisp and soft inside. Also tried the vegan Mac attack, which almost made me wish I&apos;d gotten that. 

For dessert, they had Pie Pie My Darling cakes. Got the Red Velvet one. Blew me away. Great taste and super moist. If I had one criticism it might be the drinks. Hot toddy had too much lemon and didn&apos;t impress me. Irish coffee made up for it though.

A note on ambiance. The place is cozy so I wouldn&apos;t plan on much space to stretch out. Didn&apos;t have to wait on a fairly busy night though. It got a bit cold but that&apos;s because people wouldn&apos;t let the outer door close before opening the inner one. Not much a place can do about that except maybe put up a sign.

Overall, it&apos;s rare to find a vegan / vege place where you don&apos;t have to compromise on texture or taste. Handlebar delivered on both. I definitely plan on coming back for another meal sometime soon."
5,"This restaurant was very cute! Due to covid, they had 6 feet birders in the ground. We sat outside in the back with lots of cute plants and lights! I got the margarita ($8) with a greenie and my friend got a the &quot;chicken&quot; wrap. We also got fried pickles as an appetizer and it seems like a lot of people were ordering the same thing. I would give atmosphere 10/10 and food 9/10!!"
