5,A+ to Bad Apple for doing an amazing job in the time of post-quarantine patio service. I love the fact that menus are on a QR code system-no reusing of menus is a very thoughtful concept. It was very easy to use and read. Also our service was awesome! Everyone was very attentive. The tables were well spaced out and everyone was in masks and gloves. Such a nice first dinner out with the family since quarantine began. I will definitely be back very soon (as always)!
5,"If I could give more stars, I would!

My Reviews are based on the following:

STAFF- Immediately greeted by RYAN (Bartender). Super friendly, gave us the option to sit wherever we felt comfortable. We chose to sit in an isolated area, Ryan took the time to turn on all the tv&apos;s for us including music to make us Not Feel Excluded. We also observed, that no-matter how busy it got Ryan still took the time to come around frequently to check up on us! Ryan represents the front of the business in a very postive professional way! 

Andrea- Was our waitress super kind and patient with us. She took the time in explaining what each item on the menu consisted of. She gave us our space, but remained consistent checking on our well-being.

We were also very impressed that both RYAN &amp; ANDREA wore PPE allowing us to feel safe. During Covid we understand that the restuarant industry is not an easy atmosphere for staff during a pandemic. However, they were completely responsible in ensuring customer safety and social distance. 
Thank you!

FOOD- I had the &quot;SLOW BURN&quot; burger that lived up to it&apos;s reputation recommended by Andrea. Very lean meat, so many flavorful elements into this burger. I will not say what&apos;s in this burger until you try it! Fresh cut fries!
Appetizer: Cheese curds, very light and filling! Best way to start your way into a meal. 

PRICE- You get what you pay for, not cheap but definitely worth every penny. 

CLEANLINESS- For a city restaurant, operating during covid. I was very impressed to see how well maintained cleanliness was. I did not see anything out of the ordinary, minus not wearing gloves so for that I rate cleanliness at a 90% which I deem to be fair.

OVERALL SUMMARY- My significant other &amp; I, chose to come to this establishment with high expectations that were met by both (RYAN &amp; ANDREA). This was our first time, and it will NOT be our LAST. Thank you for welcoming us, &amp; respecting the new guidelines regarding PPE. You are acknowledged for working &amp; serving customers during an on going-pandemic. I hope this restaurant realizes it&apos;s assets that keeps them operating."
5,"So glad Bad Apple has been able to keep operating during COVID! Lovely, quality, tasty burgers with unique flavor combos. Truffle fries are great! And they offer local brews in cans. Our favorite go to for burger delivery!"
5,"I love it. Best burgers in town! 10/10 would eat again

Try their many burgers, and drinks!"
4,"We had a great experience at the bad Apple!

Food: The burgers were good and definitely over the top with toppings which was fun!  The thunderdome burger was a real showstopper presentation wise and was also very yummy.  We had to try to the Elvis burger (peanut butter and bacon) but were not huge fans of the combo.  Still good but an interesting burger to try.  The thing we loved the most were the cheese curds as an appetizer!  Wow were these good and the portion size was huge!

Service:  Our waitress was lovely, she even took the time to go over all of her favorite burgers and talk about why she liked which ones.  Also, I felt very safe in this restaurant during Covid and felt like all safety precautions were handled wonderfully."
4,"Really friendly service, good beer selection, and very unique and fun different types of burgers!"
5,Bad apple was an amazing experience! I planned not 1 but 2 business ideas in the 60 min I was here. I rediscovered my childhood playground game of Big Booty and Jerad treated us like god damn kweens! Best bar ever
4,The slow burn is a very good dish. The staff went above and beyond and constantly checked up on a group to ensure that we had the best time we possibly could. This goes a long way because although the food wasn&apos;t amazing the staff made it enjoyable. We will definitely be back simply because they went above and beyond and we had such a great time.
3,"I want to preface with that the food rating is higher than the rating I gave. 

I heard about this place from reddit.com/r/chicagofood and my buddy said his manager recommended this place so we had to come. I saw the TOMARROW NEVER DIES burger had bone marrow and immediately decided that was my order. I also added the truffle salt on my fries and ordered a red ale sour as well. The sour was great, nice a tart with a hint of sweetness. I can&apos;t remember the exact name but it was on draft. The tartness was great in between burger bite to cut through all the heaviness of the burger.

The burger as a whole was fantastic. The beef was well seasoned which not many burger places do so I really appreciated it. Truffle added nice complexity and sweetness of the onion was a nice touch. A top contender to the au cheval burger. However, it was missing an acidic element but the sour made up for it. It came on a brioche bun which I enjoyed, so pillowy soft.

My only issue with the burger was that the bottom bun got way too soggy, not sure if it was from the burger sitting too long or what. Also, the bone marrow is unnessary, while a great addition, the rich beefy flavor of the bone marrow was lost in the burger. By no means was it bad, but I just think it may be better to get it on the side and enjoy the bone marrow on its own.

Lastly the fries, nice and crisp, they were nicely done, simple. The truffle salt was phenomenal but then again I&apos;m a sucker for truffles. Unfortunately, it was way too salty, and I love salt. 

The server was super friendly and nice, she knew the menu well and gave us good recommendations. Only issue was it took her longer to get us the check than for us to get the food. It wasn&apos;t busy at all but it took her a long time to drop off the checks, pick up the checks, and to run our card. It felt like she came back every fifteen min. She also never refilled our water, and messed up our checks.

This place has great potential and I hope they just touch up on little things. Overall, great burgers, would definitely come back again."
5,"What a fun and incredibly surprising find!

Out and around Bucktown doing some furniture shopping (ugh, save me). Getting to that level of hangry (furniture shopping with your husband doesn&apos;t help either) so I took to my trusty Yelp search.

Bad Apple was one of the first options that popped up. Located on a corner with limited neighborhood street parking, Bad Apple was exactly what I needed.

Decor consists of dragons and more fantasy than anything else. Bar area and plenty of table seating. We were sat right away.

Seems to be a team effort with service here. One server took our beer orders (thank you for having dark beers!!!!) Another took our food orders, someone else brought out our food, but all 3 servers checked up on us. 

Ryan, particularly was super welcoming and really nice! Service is always pretty spotty in these neighborhood pubs, so it was appreciated that everyone was on top of their jobs. Amanda (not me) was also super awesome and really helpful in picking out beers!

Menu had some pretty original burger offerings. Names are cheeky, fun and follows the dragon/fantasy theme. But the beer list. The beer list. Not only do they tell you what&apos;s on deck, but they map out their bottles by region. I enjoyed the Scottish ale and Stay Puft Nutbrown. The nutbrown was probably one of the best beers I&apos;ve ever had. The pours are pretty tiny; 12oz for the ones we ordered. This is okay, because the alcohol content is pretty high - just be forewarned in case you are expecting a full pint.

Have added The Bad Apple to the short list of pubs that we will frequent in the future. 

Cheers!"
4,"A reliable, funky spot with a variety of spins on the average burger. 

Everything is fresh and made to order. Several rotating options, along with a Burger of the Month. Always enjoy my meal here, and will keep coming back."
5,"If you&apos;re looking for delicious drinks, a chill vibe and friendly staff, this is the place to go to! Leah was our server and the 2 bartenders provided assistance where needed. I unfortunately didn&apos;t get there names. I had 2 rounds of the strawberry fields and my date had an old fashioned. We split an order of cheese curds and we devoured them!"
5,Delicious burgers and fries. Friendly and cool staff. Homemade ketchup is to die-for.
4,"Came to the Bad Apple for Happy Hour, this place is a Lincoln Square favorite amongst beer and burger lovers. 

It&apos;s easy to find parking in the surrounding neighborhood. Nice bar area and friendly servers and locals. 

They have quite an extensive selection of beers, as well as burgers. It had been some time since My last visit, this was one of my buddy&apos;s favorite places to have a meal, as he lived within walking distance. 

As I mentioned previously, he had fought cancer like a Navy Seal. I&apos;m glad to have finally come back, after regaining my own courage. I felt like I was a having a beer with my dear old friend. It&apos;s great how a restaurant and meal can remind you of good times and an awesome person."
5,"Bad Apple deserves more stars! I picked up 2 burgers and fries from them and though we were picking up from them, they didn&apos;t forget anything! They included their in-house ketchup! It really comes down to the little things. Burgers were great. Fries were delicious. I highly recommend going!"
4,It&apos;s a cool place for burgers! I ordered their vegan burger which was delicious. Good sized burgers. Staff was polite. Definitely recommend this place.
3,"Ambience is fine, the hostess was friendly, our server was really good. He was friendly and made some recommendations. For the app I tried the fried cheese curds which were decent. I ordered the triple threat and that is the reason why I am giving a three star rating. The triple threat consisted of a sausage, burger and short rib sandwiches with fries. I hoped this would be fantastic from previous reviews from this app. But after eating my entree I found the meal to be average. The meats were somewhat dry and not juicy. No flavor that I could rave about. Fries were mediocre. For me to give a five star I grade on food, ambience and service. Everything else was fine but the food was lacking."
4,"Overall my experience at Bad Apple was a positive one. The wait staff was extremely kind and quick on getting back to us. The ambiance and artwork in the restaurant I thought was absolutely beautiful. The cheese curds here were probably some of the best cheese curds I&apos;ve ever had, they literally melt in your mouth. The main event which was the wagyu burger was subpar though. It was my first time having wagyu and I&apos;m unsure on whether it&apos;s the way wagyu tastes or if what I had wasn&apos;t good.. My burger tasted more like a hotdog than it did a delicious beef patty. If the burger was better I would definitely give this place a 5/5. I&apos;ll definitely be coming back for the curds and to try a different burger."
5,"Bad Apple is great. The cheese curds are great, the beer is great, the burgers are great, and most importantly, the people are really great. Want a place that&apos;ll actually cook your burger rare when you ask for it rare? Bad Apple. Want some excellent, specific beer recs? Bad Apple. Thanks for being the best!"
3,I like the ambience and servers are nice and friendly. They have a wide selection of beer which I like. The fried cheese curds were good and crispy.i ordered the bad apple burger and my bf got the triple threat. It was just okay to be honest. Some part of the burger was dry and not juicy enough. Maybe if i get medium rare instead of medium. It be better. I do like the bun. It&apos;s pretty buttery and soft. The fries weren&apos;t pretty  bad. They were crispy. Wish it was hot though. Also their ketchup is a little too sweet.
