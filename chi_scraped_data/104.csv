5,"**Vegetarian Friendly**

If you&apos;re looking for a cute family-owned place with a great Italian feel, this is the place! It&apos;s a fairly large indoor restaurant with plenty of outdoor dining with string patio lights. My favorite part was the owner went around and said greeted his guests. You can tell this business is the owner&apos;s passion. 

Ordered:
- Antipasta: Burrata and Arancini del Giorno
- Pizze: Margherita, Diavola, Enzo
- Dessert: Tartufo

The table enjoyed the Burrata because it was seasoned well and you had the chance to absorb all of the flavors. 

The pizza is very thin just like you would get in Italy. The table favorite was the Margherita, but their Daily Specials are worth browsing too! 

I would recommend this place, and definitely be back! 

PS: For reservations, call the restaurant directly. They are not on an app."
5,"I think this was the best pizza I&apos;ve had in chicago! So good. The staff was great, they offer delivery and pick up with covid. They also have some outdoor seating, although no heaters. We ended up picking one up and sat outside to eat so we could try it before it got cold. Excited to come back here when it gets warmer or the world starts opening up again."
5,"Just had 2 of their pizza and the burata today!  All excellent tasting.  Margherita tasted exceptional good like what we had at international restaurants outside the US.  Davoli was great also.  Crust is great and ingredients are fresh.

I tired to eat outdoors, but they were full so had to get it to go.  I really wish it was delivered instead of pick-up.  Still great and great risk management against COVID with sanitized pens!"
4,"Neat spot to grab some authentic Italian pizza. 

Staff was really good about enforcing COVID guidelines, from cleanliness to the layout of the indoor dining and pick up area. Enjoyed the ambience, though tables were small especially when the pizzas were served.

Diavola was great!! Pizzas are loaded with toppings and dough was good, just thinner than anticipated. Personally, red base pizza was tastier than white. 2 pizzas for 3 people seemed like a good portion. After all that, the tartufo was by far one of the most delicious desserts I&apos;ve had. The custard filling was a treat and each bite just melts in your mouth.

While my friend, fianc√©, and I were butchering the food names on the menu, we ended up mentioning burrata. A cute couple close by highly recommended it, saying it was the best in chicago and straight from Italy. No regrets!"
4,"Ordered to go on a Friday night - it did take about an hour plus for the food to be ready (they were completely slammed) 
Since going to Italy I constantly crave  the Napolian style pizza and this place did not disappoint . 
The margarita is flavored perfectly and tasted just as it did with when I was in Italy (and I bet even better fresh from the oven)
I learned that it is traditional for the pizza not to be cut however challenging when bringing it home without a pizza cutter.
I&apos;ll definitely be back - but preferably in person fresh out of the oven ."
5,"This spot is directly in my line of foot traffic in my neighborhood and is full of top notch nostalgia. The pizza maker/ owner stands in the window swirling dough! He saw my 8-yr-old son and after saying hello, went to get him a sample and bring it outside to him. When the first didn&apos;t quite suit him, he went back inside and came out with another rendition!
I was delighted. Great window shopping. They are lively at work and ready to take your order."
4,"I got this to go for my little picnic with friends so my review might change when I go there in person . In short, I will check this place in person in the near future because it is the real deal. 

Because I knew this place was going to be jumping, I decided to try to order around noon today for pickup by 6:15. I was told that they don&apos;t have a way to really order ahead so I should call back closer to the time I want to pick it up. While this was a little odd, they were pretty nice about that and I appreciated the good customer service. I asked him what the arancini of the day was. He told me it was summer squash and lemon zest. He said it&apos;s really good and I agreed! I put that on my list! 

I was hoping to pick it up a little after  6 so I called at 5:35 thinking that would be enough time. When they answered the phone, they must have said it was going to be 10 to 15 minutes, but I swore they said 15 to 20 minutes. I ordered my food and started to make my way to the place which was 20 minutes away. They would text me when the food was ready (great plan). However, the food was ready in 8 minutes! Great turnaround, but I was then very late. I would have thought they would have kept it warm, but the box was just out. No surprise that my pizza was cold by the time I stared eating it. I know it was mostly on me, but it was a little disappointing. The arancini was warm so that wasn&apos;t bad! 

Once I got to the park, I saw my next problem. The pizza was not cut. This was a common issue with my other friends who got their food there too. Luckily, one of us had a pizza cutter, but that was more time for the pizza to get cold. The pizza, however, was outstanding. I got the pistachio which included sausage and cheese.
Great white pizza! I highly recommend. The dough was delicious and the ingredients were fresh. Some thought it was a little pricey, but I thought  it was fairly price, especially for the quality. This is the Italian pizza you are looking for! The arancini was also fantastic, but it was full of blue cheese, not lemon zest and summer squash. While I was a little disappointed on that, the blue cheese one was solid and probably better anyway! What a fortunate mistake. 

Setbacks aside, I could tell that this place is a hidden treasure in Lincoln Square and will be back in person to get another pizza. I highly recommend trying this place out!"
5,"I just realized that I never rated this place.. and even though it&apos;s been a few years since I&apos;ve been here, and they don&apos;t really need another review, I have to say this is one of the few restaurants my husband and I talk about returning to when we&apos;re in Chicago again. They have excellent pizza with ridiculously fresh ingredients and amazing sauce. Please don&apos;t ever close so we can always go back for more!"
5,"You HAVE to include this place when you have something special. This is my favorite place to go for birthdays or special occasions. I usually go with a smaller group no more than 4, but they have a back area for a larger group. 
Wine suggestions are always really on point, they always have wonderful pizza specials. And the BURATTA! It&apos;s so delish, start with one when you sit down. With kind staff, delicious food, and a great atmosphere, I have never been steered wrong here."
3,"Reasonably good pizzas, regrettable desserts, nice outdoor sitting if you can get it. 

Quick service. 

My second time to have their pizzas. Tonight my wife and I ordered 3. I doubt I&apos;d be taking a special trip there."
5,"I had a salsiccia and funghi pizza with the octopus and fagoli beans. Both were excellent, although the octopus dish had a little too much beans for my partners taste. They gave me a sample of a sandwich with figs and it was amazing, im sad to see it&apos;s not on the menu. Owner if you read these reviews, please add it to the menu. It was the best thing I had from there. My boyfriend won&apos;t stop talking about it."
5,"Made a reservation for 9 people for 6:30pm on a Sunday. Make sure your whole party is there so you can get seated on time!

We ordered 2 burrata for the table that came out almost instantly. AMAZING! Spacca&apos;s burrata was the best that I&apos;ve had in the city. The creamy cheese is drizzled with olive oil and paired with the crunchy bread; it&apos;s to die for. I&apos;d eat this every day if I could! 

Pizza wise my favorite was the Pistachio. Sounds weird right? One of our friends had been here before and highly recommended it - I&apos;m so glad they did. All of the ingredients were fresh and the flavors were unique. A definite must try! 

We also ordered the Diavola, Margherita, Prosciutto e Rucola, the special with the duck egg on top and truffle, and a few more. Every one of them was delicious! Clearly I need to go back and eat them again.

Dessert wise you really can&apos;t go wrong with the Tiramisu, however the Panna Cotta stole the show for me. It was silky, creamy, and smooth, but was contrasted by the pear balsamic compote sauce. The tartness of the sauce calmed down the sweetness and created a nice balance. I&apos;ll order this every time I come back!

Overall this place was a huge win for me and I&apos;m glad I finally got to cross it off my To-Eat list. Go with more people so you can try more dishes!"
1,Pizza is not that great the bread was soggy by the time we got it and it wasn&apos;t even cut by them. I would not recommend this place you&apos;re better off going to papa John&apos;s
4,"Upon arrival place was crowded and there was a wait, they do not take reservations for 2 or less which is a bummer.. Moving on, after waiting for some time my friend and i sat and ordered a meal, not to mention this place does not serve pasta, yep you heard that, no pasta, pizza, eggplant but no pasta, food was amazing, we were offered samples of wine which was nice, food was tasty, prices reasonable for the quality you receive.

Staff very attentive, location clean, cannot comment on the lavatory as i did not visit. Upon exit you are given a complimentary canoli, yum.

I recommend this place."
4,"[Take-Out Review]

Delicious and authentic pizza right in the neighborhood!! 

I ordered 3 pizzas for the 4 of us and we did not have any leftovers!!

-Diavola- (basil,  tomatoes, Italian mozzarella, and caprese soppressata. This is my second favorite)! 
-prosciutto rucola (arugula, Parmesan, and provola)
-salsccia (classic sausage pizza, which is my favorite)! 

Can&apos;t wait to come back and dine in on the patio before it gets cold."
5,"SO delicious! Making the trek from downtown was so worth it. We sat outside and there weren&apos;t heat lamps, but were encouraged to bring blankets upon making a reservation. I&apos;d been craving Neapolitan style pizza and boy, this place went above and beyond! We tried the Capricciosa and Enzo (added sausage) pizzas. Holy crap - mouthwatering. Jimmy was also such a sweet server! You can&apos;t beat it. Go and support!"
2,"Never in my life have I been delivered food that was burned and NOT been offered a replacement when I said I do not eat charred food.

We ordered a gluten-free pizza based on the reviews and we were very disappointed. The served said it had to be burned because the gluten-free crust takes longer to cook.  I see other photos on Yelp that show gluten-free pizzas that were not burned.

We picked off all the burned parts. Left them in a pile and ate the non-burned parts.  Overall, the pizza was a 5.5/10.  

Summary: No, I do not recommend. For amazing (properly cooked) gluten-free pizza in Chicago, I highly recommend trying Stella Barra Pizzeria on Halstead."
5,"As a European who grew up on good pizza I have to say I&apos;m hard to impress. Spacca Napoli delivers though! Their appetizers are very authentic and deliciously fresh (that burrata just melts in your mouth). The pizzas are thin crust, so you really get to taste the ingredients and don&apos;t feel like you are loading up on bread and air. It&apos;s still a carbivore&apos;s dream but with a little more balance. 
They don&apos;t have coke but rather an Italian cola which is good but really can&apos;t compare to coke (it&apos;s just two very different drinks). Their cappuccino is a perfect finish to a great meal. 
They are usually very busy so make sure you give them a call ahead of time. 
Covid note: they will remain open for takeaway if you are craving a delicious meal during your social distancing days."
5,"Delicious Neapolitan pizza and amazing Italian food. The burrata cheese is imported directly from Italy, and the arugula and prosciutto pizza is not to be missed. They don&apos;t deliver, and you can only order in-person. When you are that good, you can forgo the online traffic that most restaurants need to survive. Not Spacca Napoli. North side gem!"
5,"Amazing Neapolitan pizza, some of the best around. 

Give em a call and enjoy their carry out so you can get a taste for their vittles and stop in when we are ungrounded by the Governor."
