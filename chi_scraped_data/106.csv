5,"This is one of the best pizza places I have been too! We dined in (well, outside, it is COVID times and all) and even though it was pretty brisk out, we had a great time.  The tent could have been a little warmer, but not going to knock them on that when the food was soooo good.  We got a half and half pizza, which you can do if the base sauces are the same, so we did the margherita and ricotta and pepperoni, which were both absolutely amazing.  We also got one of the meatball dip sandwiches and oh my gosh it was so good.  The dip on the side keeps it from getting soggy and the giardinaira (?) was so yummy and not too spicy.  The food was all piping hot and so amazing.  I love exploring new spots, so I try not to go back to places, but this one is going to have to be a favorite that we keep going back too.  

10 out of 10 would recommend!!"
5,"FIRE ME UP

This place is the best! The pizza here is on fire. The coal fired oven creates such an amazing crust on the pizza. When you arrive at the restaurant all you will smell is wonderful pizza baking. My nose wants to move in here for all of the free smells. 

This place is so consistent. The food is hot and perfect every time. Their carry out game is on point. When I put my order in over the phone, they will tell me 15 minutes and they aren&apos;t lying. I always set a timer and they have never been late. I&apos;m walking in the door at 14 minutes and I can see them pulling my pizza from the hot coal fired oven. It&apos;s so fast. 

Honestly you can&apos;t go wrong with any of the pizza&apos;s here. Our favorite pizza that we always order is the pepperoni with fresh house made whipped ricotta. We just love this pizza. It&apos;s so tasty and fresh every single time. It&apos;s our go to pizza but honestly you can&apos;t go wrong with any of their selections. 

So if you&apos;re looking for a pizza that&apos;s fired to perfection then look no further. The owners and staff at Coalfire are super nice and will treat you like family. Pizza&apos;s meant for sharing and making friends. This place is always a great option for a fantastic pizza."
5,"Best brick oven pizza in the entire city I kid you not. I&apos;ve been sick af (not covid) and my lovely friend brought over a jalapeño pepperoni that gave me life like I never knew before. All that pepperoni and cheese gave me the will to live once again and the jalapeños did wonders for my sinuses. I&apos;m pretty sure it was magical because the next day I woke up feeling ready to kick 2021&apos;s butt! Thanks for keeping it real, Coalfire"
5,"Good not great. Would&apos;ve been better live. But gave me the usual pizza poops I&apos;m used to. Goes great with a movie and a lover to cuddle with.  Warning: dog will beg for some. 

5 stars"
4,"The pizza is SO good. We got the pistachio pesto, lasagna, and the white pizza as delivery. The pistachio pesto was all our favorite of the 3. My second favorite was the white pizza, and then I probably wouldn&apos;t get the lasagna pizza again. We didn&apos;t notice that they gave us ricotta on the side until we had finished eating the pizza. That would have probably made the lasagna and white pizza taste better. We got 3 pizzas for 4 people and that was the perfect amount. I would definitely order again! 

They did take over 2 hours to deliver our pizza, so beware if you want it to come immediately."
5,"Everyone KNEADS to know about this Coalfire&apos;s fantastic pizza! I went with a group of adventurous eaters and I loved trying things that were out of my comfort zone. I absolutely did not regret it.

Jalapeno pepperoni #2: 4.5/5 - similar to an ordinary pepperoni pizza but spicier! The whipped ricotta is a great addition to the top, which balances out spiciness

Pistachio pesto: 5/5 - WOW. I have never thought to add honey to a pizza and this perfect mixture of savory, salty and sweet. The pistachio pesto is also not as overwhelming as a regular pesto can be. You can get honey on the side so you can control how sweet you want it to be.

Njuda: 5/5 - don&apos;t let the name scare you off! It&apos;s the last item on the menu but in my opinion is a must try. Njuda is a spreadable type of spicy pork and is placed on the pizza in small dollops. It added such a rich flavor to the pizza without being too much

I would HIGHLY recommend the pistachio pesto and njuda! Both provided unique flavors that I have never tried anywhere else!"
4,"I got the pepperoni jalapeño and the goat cheese and chive. Loved the goat cheese and the pepperoni was good. It&apos;s SUPER thin which I didn&apos;t mind bc you can eat more and it&apos;s not too filling but keep in mind when you&apos;re ordering because they&apos;re not cheap and not filling.

We did order takeout and I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s better in the restaurant. Basically, solid pizza. Would have again but wouldn&apos;t go out of my way for it. Especially with all the other options in Chicago, more likely to try somewhere new. But still good!"
3,"5 stars on everything but the crust/ value.  We got a pizza margharita with broccolini and it was fantastic, first rate pizza like you&apos;d get in Italy or italian Switzerland.  Blazing fast and great staff!

Crust of actual pie was sweet, super thin, and yet firm. So good.  The basil had some stems i removed but otherwise delicious and the broccolini we added was wonderful!  

We&apos;ve never come by here before but i was looking forward to the crust, and wow it was mostly like eating charcoal.  I had to tear it off to enjoy the rest. Weird thing is i&apos;m into good crusts and i dunno if we got a burnt pie or if thats their product.  At 20+ for a 14&quot; i&apos;m hesitant to buy in again.  Such a great group and such a minor near miss for others, so if u don&apos;t care about carbon crusts you&apos;ll love it.  We really did!"
4,This restaurant deserves 5 stars in person but only 3 for takeout. Their crispy thin crust pizza just does not carry very well--it may be better to wait until indoor dining is an option again
4,"We ordered 2 pizzas from Coalfire last week, and I thought this was a solid 4.5/5 experience. 

Pizzas:
- Stracciatella &amp; sausage: 4.5/5
- Bacon jam: 4/5

The pizzas overall were a breath of fresh air from deep dish (I&apos;m a Chicagoan who doesn&apos;t like deep dish, please don&apos;t hate me). They were, however, almost a bit too thin (or just soggy?) where you can&apos;t pick up the slice, fold it in half, and put it in your mouth without the end of the pizza dropping down and all the toppings falling off. Obviously the two hand assist isn&apos;t the end of the world, it just would be nicer to be able to have all your toppings stay on the za without so much effort. 

Anyway, both pizzas we got were tasty, but the stracciatella &amp; sausage pizza was fantastic. I honestly could&apos;ve eaten that whole pizza by myself in one sitting if you let me. 

Service:
- Ordering: 4.5/5
- Delivery: 5/5

I ordered by phone, and the lady on the phone was very nice. The only reason I&apos;m docking half a star is because I asked for no onions on the stracciatella pizza, and she repeated it back to me multiple times, and the za still arrived with onions. Could&apos;ve been a mix up in the kitchen and not her fault at all, but I just really didn&apos;t want onions on my za, and they weren&apos;t the easiest onions to pick off either. 

Delivery was super timely, and the delivery driver had set the receipt and pen on the bench 6ft away from him for me to sign, which was very nice, but then I wasn&apos;t sure if I was supposed to attach the pen to the receipt and throw it back at him after I&apos;d signed or walk it up to him? I felt weird throwing it so I handed it to him, but then I felt weird getting that close to him too. Idk this is a weird time y&apos;all."
4,"I am no pizza connoisseur by any means and honestly I think going to pizza restaurants is a strange concept. Pop a frozen one In the oven and call it a day. BUT my friend sent me a photo of a pizza he was eating and I just couldn&apos;t get it out of my head. 

I ended up ordering coalfire per his recommendation and boy do I not regret it. It was DELICIOUS!!! By the time I got home it was not warm at all but everything was great!! 

I ordered the pepperoni and ricotta. I was between a few and the guy on the phone said it was his personal favorite so that&apos;s what I went with. The only thing I&apos;m not a fan of is that I think I was jipped on the ricotta I saw some photos online and I don&apos;t think I got enough and the crust tasted like it was kept in the oven for a minute or two too long and was a bit overly burnt for my taste. 

Overall next time I am craving pizza or asked for a recommendation my new favorite spot goes to coalfire. 

Thanks for being open"
5,"This pizza is AMAZING!! My new favorite pizza place. I got the black and white pizza which was black garlic, mozzarella cheese, goat cheese, and chives. This is by far the best flavor combination and I almost ate the entire pizza myself. We also tried pepperoni and whipped ricotta and it is yummy! The whipped ricotta is a must to try"
4,The service here was great. The atmosphere was relaxing and welcoming.  I enjoyed my pizza but the real seller here are the folks that work there.  I&apos;ll be back!
4,"Times are hard for us young single guys out there. It&apos;s not easy to find a date spot that is open, socially distant, and romantic enough to impress the Hinge stranger you&apos;ve charmed with your fake online persona. So, for the young buck sharpening his antlers and looking for some lockdown love, let&apos;s evaluate this restaurant&apos;s date potential.  

Men, let&apos;s be honest, one of the initial challenges in the first quarter is pretending you know anything about wine. You know red versus white and that&apos;s pretty much it. That&apos;s okay! The selections here are limited enough to not be overwhelming but diverse enough that you can pretend you have a preference / know the difference between Pinot Grigio and Pinot Noir. Reasonable prices, brief beer list, and quick service give this place a solid alcohol selection. 

The menu is fairly straightforward, with some interesting Italian meats and cheeses you may have to google while your date is in the bathroom - sopressata sounds more like a harry potter spell than a pizza topping imo - but there is enough variety to allow for some safe experimentation. My date and I shared a jalapeno/pineapple margherita, which came in with a decent presentation (I&apos;m always a sucker for coffee can pizza pan holders) and the thin crust had a buttery, crispy texture with a light herbal aftertaste. Not the pizza I would get when I&apos;m craving flavor and/or gluttony (see: Pequods), but a good meal for a date that allows room for dessert or drinks after.

Overall, Coalfire is a safe spot for a first or second date. Fairly MBE - Medium Buck Energy - but it will get the job done for a young stag who just needs a casual pasture to flash his antlers and make a good impression. Beyond that, you probably want to try some of the more unique pizza spots in the city, or explore one of the gradually reopening rooftop bars.

Or you could sit at home, watch too many nature documentaries, and write absurdly lengthy Yelp reviews. A dub either way. Overall: B-"
5,"My favorite pizza in Chicago!! 
Like the crust, the fresh ingredients, and as a vegetarian, like fact that they have a lot off veggie options. Also, of course the pizza tastes delicious!!"
5,I had a sausage pizza. The pizza was delicious especially the crust. Best crust I can remember.
5,"Want a pizza in Chicago, but not a deep dish?  Look no further than Coalfire.  While we only went there to order take-out, the staff were friendly to help us place our order and offer us some water while we waited.  We tried both the pepperoni with whipped ricotta and black and white with no complaints on either.  Every ingredient was fresh and every bite delicious.  We&apos;ll be back to try more soon!"
5,Some of Chicago&apos;s best pizza.  Great selection of creative pies.  Today we carried out a &apos;Nduja #4 and a Pepperoni &amp; Whipped Ricotta and they both hit the spot.  Highly recommended - support local businesses!
4,"Coalfire Pizzeria Chicago

Amongst the Windy city that&apos;s known for deep dish pizza is CoalFire Pizzeria serving up a commendable thin crust pizza. The ingredients are flour, yeast, salt and water. They allow about a day for fermentation. Here&apos;s the PizzaChynch deal: the pizza is worth the Uber, but take a it to go and enjoy it at home. Gosh! I have to say the restaurant&apos;s ambiance is lacking.  There&apos;s nothing special about the restaurant except for the pizza. It may be time for a remodel! Oops, almost forgot to mention, please pick the leaves off the basil stalk and delicately place it on the pizza. Don&apos;t serve a basil plant on top of the pizza Margherita. P.S. they offer a military discount, thank you.

5,"I&apos;ve been waiting and waiting to try Coalfire.   It was worth the wait!!!

In the thin crust...flavor packed...crunchy...and just plain good pizza category....this is IT!!  The coal fire oven really makes the crust stand out.

The place is intimate and serves up the food quickly.  The menu&apos;s focal point....JUST PIZZA!  

I wanna try some of the other combo pizzas.  I will be back!!"
