5,"If I googled a restaurant that I would willingly visit during quarantine, Quartino Ristorante would be the very first link to pop up! This place not only pays attention to the wants of the customers, but at the very front is a person who measures our temperatures before we&apos;re able to enter. The tables are spaced specifically to allow for social distancing, while also providing a nice homely atmosphere.

What we ordered:
  - Pappardelle: $13.25
  - Suns out Rums out: $12.25

The pappardelle was recommended by our waiter as a go-to red sauce dish, and I was not disappointed! The sauce was creamy and just felt so fulfilling that I had to slow myself down to savor the experience. The ~$13 price for a full dish at as nice of a restaurant as Quartino was an excellent surprise.

The Suns out Rums out was delicious. This is a nice, refreshing drink to complement a hearty pasta dish. If you&apos;re looking for a fruity drink then definitely consider this as an option!

Service was excellent! Our server offered recommendations that matched our specifications and was consistent in checking in with us even though the restaurant was busy. Extra tip was given as deserved.

I cannot recommend Quartino Ristorante more in trying times such as this. Their ability to be flexible in both keeping customers safe and happy is extraordinary -Â almost as extraordinary as their food!"
5,"This was our first time at Quartino. We&apos;ve been coming out to Chicago for years when we need a quick get away and so glad we tried this place. I did make reservations in advance because I visited during covid closures. 

Only outdoor seating is available NOV/2020. There are heaters everywhere so the cold did not deter diners from enjoying their meals. First up you get a complimentary bread basket with olive oil. The OO is very fresh and robust. Very good quality. We also tried the assortment of olives and they were of high quality as well. 

We tried the Campania pizza, fettuccini Alfredo, Ceasar salad, and the beef short rib. Everything was delectable. The pizza was amazing fresh ingredients baked into a crisp yet soft crust. The Alfredo was delicious. I could tell the noodles were made in house and the sauce was very authenticity Italian. The short rib was cooked to perfection and extremely tender. 

The staff was unbelievably welcoming and friendly!!!!!


We will definitely return."
5,"I went for dine-in and got outdoor seatings. I ordered a penne alla vodka pasta and it was DELICIOUS!! I&apos;ve been wanting to go back for any pesto pasta too. 

The outdoor seating was warm and cozy. I got a bottle of wine to share with my friends and that was super good."
4,"This is classic Italian restaurant located in the heart of river north. One of the historical restaurants and the quality is amazing. I&apos;ve had food here many times but just posting a review based on my latest order. A high 4.5 stars to this classic Italian gem.

I ordered the margherita pizza. The pizza was awesome. It had the right amount of cheese and flavor. Bonus points to the restaurant for giving basil on the side so that it remains fresh in the Togo order. The pizza had great taste and lived up to its simplicity. 

The veal meatballs were some of the softest and delicious meatballs I&apos;ve had. The tomato sauce it came in a bed of was fresh and had the right texture- not too thick or thin. It could use a little bit of richness, but overall great dish topped with good ricotta cheese.

Lastly, the pasta with braised short rib was okay. The tomato sauce that it was suppose to be in lacked a certain marinara flavor. Good texture to the pasta, meat cooked to goodness but the dish overall could use more flavor."
4,"This place has awesome food at great prices. We went here on a Friday night and because it was so good, we got take out the next day. Here&apos;s what we&apos;ve tried:

Veal slider: meatball is kind of small, nothing special about the taste, not sure if a slider is the best way to serve this, rather ungainly
Bruschetta: liked this a lot actually and the 3 toppings it came with, tasted very fresh
Octopus: underwhelming, it comes with 4 very small tiny tentacles on a mountain of greens, overpriced compared to the rest of their menu. Tentacles were seasoned fine, but there were some parts that were just burnt and overly crispy
Eggplant parm: okay, very heavy on the sauce and not much eggplant within
Chicken parmesan: winner of the night, the breast is very thinly cut, very moist, the sauce is generous and delicious
Side of tagliatelle bolognese: you can get a half order of any of the pastas to go with the chicken parm (pay half price of full size). The half order is more like a quarter size, mainly 3-4 mouthfuls of pasta, came out lukewarm, tagliatelle is on the thicker and chewier side. Sauce came with lots of meat. Preferred the chicken parm sauce though
Penne alla vodka: this was delicious
Margarita pizza: good but nothing to write home about
Quattro formaggio: literally looks identical to margarita just without the basil. Taste-wise, couldn&apos;t make out any extra cheese flavors on the quattro pizza
Banana dessert: excellent, the caramelized bananas were not too sweet, still contained their firmness, and just complemented the vanilla gelato so well. Every now and then you&apos;d unearth an extra dollop of chocolate fudge, and it was oh so tasty!

Long story short: get the chicken parm and banana dessert!"
2,"For my friend&apos;s birthday a few months ago, we had put in a reservation at Quartino. We were really excited to have good Italian food at this highly rated restaurant. Sadly, we were quite disappointed in our experience.

Due to COVID-19, the staff had to check our temperature before entering the restaurant, which is a great precaution. However, there was a line for parties who didn&apos;t have a reservation right next to the door. These people were not social distancing and were breathing down our necks. You had to shove your way past these people to even walk into the building. The staff didn&apos;t do anything to further enforce social distancing.

Once led in, I immediately noticed how PACKED the restaurant was. During a time where only 50-75% capacity was allowed, the restaurant didn&apos;t reflect that. Almost all tables were full and the tables were very close to each other.

We were sat in a corner with barely any light. We ordered our respective dishes, with me ordering the gnocchi. I can&apos;t even think of any other word than disappointment when receiving our food after at least a 40 minute long wait. My friends&apos; dishes were extremely bland. One had a risotto, where the rice wasn&apos;t cooked correctly and was still crunchy. One had ordered a pepperoni pizza to share, and it was very dry and hard. My gnocchi was only decently better, but still very bland. Being a 4 star rated restaurant, I was surprised by the lack of flavor in the food. 

Our waitress rarely came by our table. I could barely remember if she interacted with us. I do have to acknowledged the cooks, who brought out some of our dishes, for being so friendly and warm. In conclusion, Quartino fell short of our expectations."
5,"Great for large groups who enjoy sharing plates and like a variety of options. Their table wine by the liter is cheap (I think $20?) and the bill for the group to leave full will be much cheaper than other places. Highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates, penna alla vodka, gnocchi, steak with blue cheese, or any of the pizzas."
4,"Great Italian spot in the heart of the city. They serve tapas-style food and offer a pleasant and comfortable atmosphere with good service and plenty of outdoor dining space. The ambiance is such that you can make it what you want - I&apos;ve been here on a date, for a bachelorette party, and with my family and all were appropriate. 

The menu overwhelmed me a bit initially, but on my most recent visit we kept it simple and had a cheese plate, pizza, and pasta (all the good stuff) :). Highly recommend the taleggio and pappardelle pasts. But you can&apos;t go wrong with any of the food here! Recommend!"
4,"Such a picturesque italian spot right in the city downtown! I was really fascinated by the atmosphere and the location of the place! 
So, I came with friend and first of all they checked out temperature - a big point for such health precautions! Yet I still feel that the place was too congested. 
Pizza is superb"
4,"We came for lunch and waited a while for someone to acknowledge us at the hostess stand. We were eventually seated and after telling our server that we needed a few minutes to look at the menu, she didn&apos;t return until after 15 minutes. 

We received our bread but also had to wait a long time for someone to come back and ask for olive oil and cheese. Other than the long waits in between, the rest of the service wasn&apos;t bad. 

We ended up ordering their bruschetta, Tuscan sausage risotto, and their Tortellini. I never have any issues with Bruschetta, but their version Bruschette, came with 3 different ones, you get a roasted tomato, Sicilian eggplant and roasted mushrooms. The only good one was the roasted tomato, and for the first time ever, we didn&apos;t finish this dish or take it home. It just wasn&apos;t good. 

The Tortellini was very delicious. It came with Alfredo sauce, peas and prosciutto plated around the entire plate. This dish was creamy, and the prosciutto some saltiness to the dish.  

The Tuscany sausage risotto was my favorite dish. The rice was al dente and cooked perfectly and came with tomatoes and peas. You get plenty of sausage, but not much is needed since there&apos;s already so much flavor in this dish. I would definitely order this again. 

Despite the slow service, we still enjoyed our meal and wouldn&apos;t hesitate to come back. I know they say that you these are small plates and you should order two dishes per person, but that may really not be necessary. We got full with just two dishes and an appetizer."
3,"I have passed by this restaurant several times and each time it was crowded, but I wondered if it was because of the food or the location. And I think it&apos;s crowded because of the location. 

Quaratino seems centrally located and a quick hop from Michigan Ave. and some of the trendy bars and restaurants in River North, but the food was, meh. I ordered the penne alla vodka with chicken for takeout. The pasta isn&apos;t too fancy for an Italian dish but it does take some skill in the kitchen. 

Overall I found the sauce lacked flavor and the chicken was dry. Adjusting my expectations, I would be willing to try again but would probably steer clear of chicken or seafood dishes for the chance the kitchen might overcook.

I will add, however, the service was nice and very attentive even for my takeout order."
4,"I&apos;ve only had take out for this place so I can&apos;t review for the staff, place or service. Food is average in my opinion, it&apos;s not real Italian food, it&apos;s more American Italian, which makes the quality and taste average."
5,"Wow! Found my new favorite Italian restaurant. Get the calamari, best I&apos;ve ever had. You can also split the pasta dishes so you can honestly try them all. They also have the best expresÃ³ martinis!!"
4,"Quartino during quarantine is a glorious thing.

I used to hate going to Quartino with friends or coworkers because it was so packed and loud. My throat always hurt from shouting over the noise, as if I&apos;d been out to a bar.

But delivery? It&apos;s magic. The food is just as delicious, and I can enjoy it from my couch in peace.

Get the fondue. If you get anything, get the creamy, sweet, and savory cheese fondue. Is there crack in it? I do not know. But I cannot stop eating it.

The vodka penne is straightforward, but tasty.

Spinach salad was nothing to write home about, but made me feel better about eating a cup full of fondue and carbs.

Never stop delivering, Quartino."
5,Exceptional food and service! We went to share some small plates and wine. I was so impressed by the quality and depth of flavors. We got the eggplant Parmesan and the shrimp diavolo-- both were delicious. The wait staff was wonderful and very helpful. Can&apos;t wait to come back!
4,We did take out and thought this was some of the best Italian pizza we&apos;ve had in Chicago. They clearly really care about authenticity and ingredient quality. Their biscotti are an absolute delight with a coffee as well - a perfect way to finish the meal.
4,"I go to this restaurant whenever I have family in town and we need a nice place to eat! Overall, the restaurant itself is pretty nice but I am not a fan of the close proximity of seating. If you&apos;re a bigger person, it may not be comfortable for you as you can literally sit right next to the table beside yours. It also tends to be pretty loud so conversations may be limited. The place where we sat (right under the stairs) had a sort of stench so I would avoid that area at all costs. 

The food and service, however, was absolutely spot on! The food came rather quickly and we did not have to wait long at all despite it being crowded. Overall, I recommend coming here for a nice meal or date night."
4,"If service was good, this place might&apos;ve won the last star. I came here to celebrate an occasion, which was placed on the reservation. We were seated outside in our reservation. Luckily there were heaters and the weather with these heaters made it comforting. I was seated upstairs in the corner outside. We were given cold stale, tasted old bread and plates. The bread tasted as if someone reused the bread because one of our breads seemed to be lightly dipped with something? Our server was very dull. He asked what we wanted to drink and we were wanting a recommendation for white if we were planning on ordering seafood and beef, and he said there was a wine list. No recommendation. 

Ended up ordering the pinot grigio. 

We ordered octopus, pappardelle with braised beef, and clam linguine white. Asked if he recommended anything else and if this was enough for us to try and he looks at his book and says yeah and walks away. 

I can&apos;t say much about the ambience because outdoors was noisy, but the tables were small, there&apos;s no place to hang your purse or coat, the heaters were directly above you.

Octopus: delicious. Have you ever had tender and juicy and flavorful octopus before? I have, and this place also did a fantastic job on this dish. The vegetables were cooked nicely, there was great flavor and spice in this dish and most importantly, the octopus was cooked perfectly!! Must get!

The pappardelle with braised beef was very impressive. The noodles were so chewy and you can tell it was made fresh. The braised beef was very tender and the sauce was flavorful. Enough but I wish mine had more sauce! Wonderful choice on our end!!

Clam linguine was good, it needed lemon so if you order it, ask for it! I got it with the white sauce and it was very subtle but you definitely get the clam aroma. It was very fresh.

As soon as we finished the server never really checked on us so we had to wave him down. At that point, we didn&apos;t want to ask for dessert. We asked for our bill and he literally ran to go get it. Not sure why it was so dreadful having us, but we were polite, dressed well, and patient. The stars earned are definitely from the food."
2,"This review is for the delivery.

Super salty!  We ordered the goat milk ricotta, the tortellini and the funghi pizza.  The goat milk ricotta - this was fine.  It was an appropriate choice of cheese.  The tortellini - this was cooked okay, but it was extremely salty.  Not sure what happened here.  Maybe it was the proscuitto that was salty, the salt leeched out and the salty flavor was trapped within and permeated throughout the delivery container?  Either way, the pasta was nearly inedible.

The funghi pizza - would have been fine except we were not informed that they were going to dump red pepper flakes all over the pizza.  Not sure the opinion of the general populace but I personally don&apos;t expect a mushroom pizza to be spicy spicy."
5,"Not only was the food nothing short from amazing, the the service was one of a kind. Ordered salads, pastas, and dessert and all came out quickly while still tasting fresh. Will be back to try other items!"
