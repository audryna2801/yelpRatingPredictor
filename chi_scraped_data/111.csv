The new normal
If you&apos;re looking for a place to eat comfortably and safely during this pandemic, I recommend Big Star. They have an enclosed patio space with HEATERS that is warmed enough to enjoy your meal without a coat. I mean who wants to eat tacos with their coat on! Big Star staff really did a spectacular job making you feel safe throughout the meal. The staff wore masks at all time, the tables were spaced out, menus were posted on the web, and they offered contactless payment. 

Food &amp; Drink recs
Tacos are a la carte-I highly recommend getting the fish and the pastor. The tacos are pricey but have substances and great flavor. Also, their Blueberry Collin is so refreshing if you&apos;re looking for a Maragrita alternative. 

Once we&apos;re out of this new normal, I highly recommend checking them out in the summer. It&apos;s the place to be! Beware of the potential long waits during warmer months! I&apos;m pre-warning you, hangry individuals!"
5,"This is not your typical taco spot. It&apos;s more new age Mexican. I don&apos;t really come here for the tacos to be honest. I very much used to enjoy their tilapia fish tacos but they keep changing and updating their menu in a good way. I think my favorite taco right now is their Panza and their papas tacos. I do very much like their guac however and their margaritas. I&apos;m the type that can&apos;t have more than one because I&apos;m used to sugary margs that upset my stomach but I have found myself ordering two pitchers of margs here. I very much enjoy their regular lime ones but their spicy ones are good food 

Ultimately I come here for the ambience and the fact that it&apos;s dog friendly and not to mention I have an insane crush on my server Natalia. Whenever she is working I know I&apos;ll get a 5 star service. Not only is she attentive to me and my party but also my four legged companion when we come. 

They are operating and taking the best safety measure due to Covid and continue to offer take out. They have heat lamps and some type of tarp so that people can continue to dine in."
4,"the tacos here are pricey, but they are oh so tasty. they also have a heated, outdoor patio. you can order from the outdoor truck.

pescado - fish is super crispy and pairs so nicely with the slaw
chorizo - so flavorful and greasy. verde sauce cuts through the fat nicely"
3,"I had heard such good things about this place but sadly it didn&apos;t live up to the hype. We got the al pastor, barbacoa, chicken, and chorizo tacos. While all were very generously stuffed with filling, they all lacked good flavor. They all just tasted like heavily salted meat. No spiciness or notes of different flavors. I tried adding the salsa verde and the red chili sauce, neither added any spice or depth of flavor.  If I had to choose one to get again, it would the al pastor as it had the most flavor dimensions. I wouldn&apos;t get the barbacoa again as the meat was dry and lacked good seasoning."
5,Stopped here for some tacos and drinks at a late night business meeting. Always a favorite even as the weather is cooler. Looking forward to warmer days and fewer restrictions.
5,"We got takeout for the big game and it was great! We got a bunch of tacos, a kids quesadilla, chips and guacamole, and the margarita kit with tequila. Everything was delicious and we especially enjoyed the margaritas during the game. It tasted super fresh and was probably our highlight of the meal. While we miss being able to eat out it was nice to bring Big Star home."
3,"*pre covid review* 

The first time I came to Big Star I had a wonderful meal. I really loved the flavors of everything and thought the food was made very well. 

The 2 times I&apos;ve been since then have not been the same. Every time I&apos;ve been here I&apos;ve gotten the steak and al pastor tacos. While I wouldn&apos;t say the tacos are bad, I just think something about the quality, cooking process and or seasoning has changed. I also didn&apos;t really like my margarita since it tasted like a pre-made mix.  

I would recommend coming here to try it but just be warned that it&apos;s probably not going to be a mind blowing meal."
5,"Went here on a date.

I&apos;ve gotta say, should your date suggest this place, DO NOT sulk about it like I did. I&apos;m new in town and did a quick google and asked if he was taking me to a food truck. He responded about how in demand this place is and, coming from LA, I thought he was being defensive.

Lol. He wasn&apos;t. I was so wrong about this place. Yes, while the tacos are like $3, the vibe is fun, the drinks are great and the food is quality!

For starters:
- Chips &amp; guacamole. Note about the guac: it&apos;s like a big third of an avocado. So, that&apos;s a little weird. If you&apos;re with someone who is a double dipper, get two orders...it&apos;s gonna get gross 
- Margaritas: he definitely is a fan of theirs 
- Horchatas: a better horchata than I thought I could have in the Midwest. I had more than one and I would have more than one again.

Tacos:
He&apos;s a meat eater. He got a fish taco, barbacoa &amp; al pastor. He loves those tacos. No further comments.

I got the only noticeably vegan friendly option: potato tacos. So, they&apos;re pretty spicy and well marinated without being offensive. Definitely not like hash browns or home fries in a taco. They made the effort and blew my mind. 

What&apos;s a little meh: the parking. I wound up a block away from the park FOR FREE. The journey I made to get there though? All the photos I took of the signs, for documenting, mid panic attack though? Yeahhh not really worth it. Lyft. There&apos;s a train station (Damien) right there too. I don&apos;t do trains but some of you do.

Also important to note:
The staff is full of funny and witty personalities. Not a hater in the place, as far as I could tell.

Plus, while we were out and social distancing, it felt like the old days, pre- March 2020. If you&apos;re feeling down and want a socially distanced taste of how life used to be before the world changed, this place could lift your spirits. It was a really nice treat that I would have overlooked because Ashley doesn&apos;t go to food trucks. Hahah!

And please bring an up to date (no pun intended) working phone...you will need it to scan a menu QR code &amp; a check QR code. They are not taking any chances and nor should you."
4,"This place has COVID dining DOWN. They were so efficient and made me feel safe. A lot of outdoor seating and amazing service. Keep in mind, it is pricey. I for sure only needed to get 2 tacos but I was starving so I got 3 and didn&apos;t eat all of them. The chorizo taco was my fav and is the reason I will be back again soon. I also really liked their chips and salsa. The fish taco was not good AT ALL to me. I would call myself a fish taco connoisseur and this one had way too much bread and tasted like a funnel cake lol. The chicken taco was meh. Chorizo all the way. Also, this place is a salt bomb. I felt so full afterwards from all the freaking salt. Drink a lot of water lol.

All in all, I suggest it because it is convenient, fast, and hip. Just don&apos;t have crazy high hopes about the tacos, they are not the best around."
4,"My friend and I ordered tacos from here a few weeks ago. We tried the location in Wrigley before and liked it so much we ordered again. 

The tacos were as delish as before. We ordered a couple of the Taco de panzas (pork belly), one el pastor, and one Barbacoa, as well as a walking taco.  All of it was tasty but my favorite is the pork belly one. The way they make the skin crisp and the meat just right is perfect. The meat portions were big and very appreciated. 

I did knock a star off for presentation though. It seemed like minimal effort getting the meat in the tortilla. It was more next to it than in it."
4,"While they&apos;re not my absolute favorite tacos in Chicago, the tacos at Big Star are certainly very tasty. We usually come here after having a drink at the Violet Hour across the street. My favorite kind of taco here is the Al Pastor, and my wife&apos;s favorite is the Carne Asada. 

My only complaints are that the tacos are quite small in size compared to other places, and sometimes the wait can be very long."
5,"Came her last Friday and had to wait about 30 minutes after putting our name in but glad we did. 

Covid: they took our temperature before entering the patio, required masks during all server interactions, had a table stand that shows the server to come by otherwise they will let you eat and be mask free, there aren&apos;t any menus to touch it&apos;s all using barcode on your phone to scan, the bill is actually perfect and I hope they do this in all restaurants moving forward but it has a QR code on the check and you pay on your phone like you would for any online purchase.

Felt very safe and the food was great.

I recommend the chips and guac, al pastor and barbacoa tacos! Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the walking taco."
5,"Been to Big Star probably 50x in the last 8 years but I took my boyfriend for his first time last night and we had a great time. I thought a review might help anyone else during covid and especially on a FREEZING night. The tented area that was once their outdoor patio is perfectly warm, you don&apos;t need a coat. They keep tables at least 6&quot; apart and not a lot of groups next to each other. You can also sit inside at their booths but it was nice pretending we were on the patio :) we had the Big Star margarita pitcher, chips with salsa and guac, queso fundito, pastor and pescado tacos - all delicious as usual! Highly recommend if you haven&apos;t checked out their winter set up yet."
3,"Great food, especially the fish tacos and tacos Al Pastor--good margaritas as well. However, a bit on the spendy side. Met a friend here yesterday, and for two small margaritas, chips, salsa and guac, and six tacos, we paid $64 plus 20% tip to come to $80 total. I don&apos;t remember ever paying this much for a lunch like this on the West Coast, and I lived in both San Diego and Orange County for many years.

Would probably stick with delivery next time and make my own margaritas at home."
3,"It&apos;s okay, but vegetarian options were mislabeled on the menu with a non vegetarian option being marked as vegetarian. I&apos;m happy I asked the waiter about it or I would have been extremely unhappy. I was forced to order something really fast last minute that didn&apos;t evenend up being an actual taco."
3,"This a very popular place in wicker park , reason why it&apos;s always crowded. I&apos;ve come here many times and each time  I made a reservation but I still had to wait a bit to get my table upon arrival . There&apos;s an area you can wait right next to the restaurant or you can also stand by the bar and get a drink . Service is typically slow as well.
Their location and wrigley has less people , faster service, nicer waitresses and more space but i think the food is not as good there .

Some people say these are the best tacos in Chicago but I disagree , they&apos;re OK and at $4 or $5 per taco they&apos;re expensive as well. There are so many other places where you can get better tacos for  less . However the big star chips and queso fundido are bomb !! 

One thing I do like about this place are their Micheladas, a bit spicy but definitely one of the best I&apos;ve tried in the city. Their margaritas are really good too and you can order a pitcher which is perfect for groups . 

Overall I think this is the place to be if you&apos;re looking for a lively atmosphere ( specially during summer when the patio is open) but not a great choice if you&apos;re looking for GOOD Mexican , Mexican/inspired food."
4,"Fun taco spot in wicker park with a huge patio  - great for a quick bite, take your dog, or a group of friends and get a pitcher of margaritas. Solid tacos - nothing spectacular but v tasty. Only thing that left me wanting was they charged a deposit and said it would be deducted from the check and  they didn&apos;t. I only realized when home and have emailed them and tock but not had a response- so make sure you check your check!"
4,"Food: Decent
Atmosphere: Great

This is a classic Wicker Park spot and one of the best if you&apos;re looking for a big patio to hang out on. They also have a walk up window for take away tacos. Typically there is a first-come area for seating if you get the takeout window but during COVID they have blocked that off and added it as an extension to the host-seated part of the patio. 

I typically order 2 to 3 tacos (Chicken, Fish, Al Pastor). The fish is my favorite of the 3 but just based on personal preference wish the sauce on that taco had a bit more of a kick to it. I also like their margaritas but their &quot;spicy marg&quot; is not spicy so was a little bummed about that!

Some of the reviews on here are pretty harsh on this spot. Is this the best spot for tacos you&apos;ll have in your life? No. But is it a great location with pretty good food? Yes, for sure."
4,"I&apos;ve had Big Star a few times - both for catered parties and actual sit down meals at the restaurant. 

The restaurant itself is a super fun and boisterous environment. It&apos;s always packed, but they do have a digital wait list so you can go get a drink in the area and you&apos;ll receive a text when your table is ready. However, sometimes I&apos;ve had to find another spot for dinner when the wait has been over three hours.

The portions are somewhat small, but absolutely DELICIOUS! I&apos;ve always gotten the same few things (steak, al pastor, etc.) but this past outing I decided to try the cauliflower taco. It blew my MIND! Honestly this is the best cauliflower taco in the city. The seasoning is just insane and everything comes together so nicely. I&apos;m a big meat eater but I am going to include this one in my lineup every time from now on.

On top of that, their drinks area always great. A little small, but worth the price tag for their flavor. Sometimes service can be a little slower but when you&apos;re constantly packed it&apos;s definitely expected! Also if you order some guac and chips it&apos;s enough to tie you over during the wait for your meal. Can&apos;t wait to go back!"
3,"Their drinks are tasty enough. They have a HUGE patio with heaters which is great for those wanting to eat outside during the pandemic. However, we were a table of six and they served the tacos family style - forcing us to almost touch our friends&apos; tacos, not a good idea during covid. Also, service was so-so, the waiters were not really very friendly or available. The tacos are very mediocre. Wouldn&apos;t come back."
