5,"Lou Malnati&apos;s is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, and probably in the country. I can say that with conviction because I have been eating pizza in Chicago for over 70 years! 

My friend and I ate outside last Saturday at 4:00, when the weather in November was 70Â°. We had called to have our name put down on the list and pre-order the pizza. The manager, Jorge, greeted us upon arrival. He was beyond attentive, and kept coming over to make sure everything was going well. Our server was also extremely attentive. The service was above and beyond fabulous, and the pizza was perfection.

I will continue to order this wonderful pizza for delivery through the winter, but I will miss the wonderful service that goes along with it at the restaurant. Hopefully we will all be back soon. Lou&apos;s is the best!!"
5,"I still dream about this pizza! I LOVE IT! Their The Lou is hands down the best. If you come here, try this one over the regular deep dish. I love pizza with veggies and the fact that The Lou is a deep dish veggie pizza is beyond amazing! My sister and I shared their house salad and wow! Just wow! It was a nice appetizer getting us ready for a one of a kind deep dish experience. It was big enough for my sister and I to share. I enjoyed The Lou that much, I ordered them to be delivered back home to Florida via Taste of Chicago. 

Can&apos;t wait to be in Chicago again to eat this in person."
5,"After falling in love with Lous our first time eating here I&apos;ve since ordered two large deep dish class lous that have been far undercooked. Very saddened that this keeps happening because the first time my husband and I had Lous pizza we thought it was life changing. 
At $40 a pie I won&apos;t be ordering from here anymore.


Updating my review to 5 stars for this location.

We had amazing service here a few weeks from Moses! He was happy to take my order for a large deep dish pizza with no cheese on half. 
Also great service from bar staff, amazing spicy margarita!

Since being in quarantine we&apos;ve ordered from Pequods and here. Let me just tell you that I now am 100% positive that LOUS is the absolute BEST Chicago style deep dish pizza!!

5,"If you go here and have heart and or weight issues tell your doctor right away. 

Awesome deep dish pizza tho I love it live fast die young"
5,I got the Lou with sausage it was soo good. First time trying authentic Chi deep dish. It&apos;s a lot of food
4,"After a trip from New York, this place really, really hit the spot. We really missed the butter crust and the amazingness of the deep dish pizza here.

I think that the hostess could have been friendlier, and I&apos;m also a little bit disappointed that the food took longer than they said it would. There are a lot of homeless people walking around here, and as I waited outside, I unfortunately watched a man expose himself to a group of shocked diners sitting outside. If I had gotten my food on time, I would&apos;ve missed the show. 

I wish I missed the show. 

Anyway, the food here is always spot on. Will be back!"
4,"Yummy pizza. Does deep dish how it should be. Out of all the chains, this one is the best! A must while in Chicago."
4,Definitely a must stop on the tourist list! We enjoyed our experience for sure :) we also had a really great server!
2,"Arrived to Chicago late and decided to order Lou Malnati&apos;s to be delivered to The Drake. We ordered around 10:30pm and the lady who helped us on the phone mentioned after we already paid the wait would be over an hour and then hung up. I ordered a salad with chicken and my friends ordered the deep dish pizza. The salad was bland and so was the chicken. I&apos;m not picky when it comes to salads and this was one of the worst i&apos;ve had. Not to mention they didn&apos;t include a fork...
My friends generally love pizza and we&apos;re not impressed. A sad start to our trip- would not recommend."
5,Best place I&apos;ve been to eat in Chicago. Mark was our server. He was great! Best service! Pizza was amazing. I will definitely be back!!
4,"I absolutely love Lou Malnati&apos;s! I wanted to grab some dinner on a Sunday evening and watch an NBA game and what better place than Lou&apos;s. The deep dish pizza takes about 30 minutes so please welcome yourself to a glass of red wine or beer while you wait. It is worth it. I&apos;ve been to Lou&apos;s plenty of times and each time I was not disappointed.

 Now was I did find weird is that the wait staff kept eating out of the fruit tray at the bar (you know, where bartenders grab an orange slice or cherry for your drink). I mean a bunch of staff, not just one or two. I just found that unprofessional to do in front of patrons especially considering they aren&apos;t using gloves to grab the fruit. With the hysteria going around about viruses/sicknesses one would think they would be a bit more sanitary for an establishment. 

Other than that, I still love Lou&apos;s!"
5,"Chicago = pizza! 

We came to Lou Malnatti&apos;s well because it is a place you need to go when you in Chicago.  LOVED IT!!! We had the vegetable deep dish and I will be honest with you I&apos;m thinking of a summer trip to Chicago for a repeat.  

I think they ship across the country...I might have to do that."
3,"Lou Malnati&apos;s Pizzeria has such a great reputation with locals and visitors. For me, I think it&apos;s pretty good.

There are several locations but I have frequented the Gold Coast spot most often. On several occasions, I have been met with staff that are less than friendly. I know it gets busy and they are probably just sick of people but why don&apos;t youtalk about people behind their back - not to their money paying face. I usually go on off hours, when it isn&apos;t busy so I guess I end up with the frazzled staff after a long busy night. Eye rolling and sighs are just a big no-no!

I gave this place one last try simply because I was tired, hungry, it was on my way home and it was open. I was alone, sat at the bar and just had a salad. There were two bartenders that looked alike and were absolutely amazing! Friendly and efficient, they remained attentive and were all smiles.

The deep dish pizza they are so famous for, is really good. A bit different from the others, it is crunchy and has a sauce with a lot of texture from the tomatoes. I prefer that over the tons of cheese and soft doughy crust. I love their salads too. The house dressing is tart and refreshing.

The bottom line is Lou&apos;s is starting to feel a bit like a chain. I prefer small spots with a warmer atmosphere but they do know how to do pizza."
4,"We came here to try the next on our adventures of the best deep dish pizza. 

We walked the mile from our hotel. We have to burn these pizza calories off. 

When we got here, they sat us right away and at a booth thank god. 

We met our waiter who was awesome. Spanish dude. Didn&apos;t catch his name. Very outgoing. 

We ordered the Chicago. We also got a Lou salad. That was awesome. 

Everything was good. Was not the best deep dish pizza but the salad was great. 

Overall it was a solid 4.5."
5,"I&apos;ve only had one other Chicago deep dish experience from another well known chain, and Lou Malnati&apos;s definitely takes the cake!

As with every restaurant, there can be longer wait times experienced depending on the time that you visit. We came shortly after they opened and there wasn&apos;t a wait at all! Our group of 6 went with 2 large Chicago classics (sausage, cheese, tons of tomato sauce) and we were already stuffed after 1 slice each! The crust was crispy but thick, and the sauce was generous. Overall, it tasted very rich and flavorful! We also shared a Malnati salad which was similar to a garbage salad, and was a great way to start off our meal.

Service was a bit slow, but overall it was friendly. Our server also boxed up all of our extra slices for us once we were done with our meal. Additionally, if you end up loving the pizza that you&apos;d want more, they also sell it in frozen form to take home with you!"
1,"All throughout my childhood deep dish pizza was an essential we had either Lou&apos;s or Giordano&apos;s at least once every few weeks. We recently moved to the city from the suburbs and I was beyond excited to find out that there was a lou&apos;s one block away from our new home but it turned out to be a HUGE disappointment. 

I&apos;ve been to this location 4 times now and every single time it lets me down. The service is always horrific. We have gotten rude waiters, upwards to about 1.5 hours for our pizza to come out, and just incredibly slow service. The pizza is always SO soggy. Our favorite pizza is &quot;the Lou&quot; and we absolutely LOVE the buttercrust but at this location our pizza is so soggy it can&apos;t even be transferred onto our plates in one piece. Another favorite of ours is the cookie pizza in a skillet for dessert. Unfortunately, at this location we received a completely burnt cookie pizza once and the other two times our cookie pizza was cold from the center??!! 

I&apos;m honestly shocked at how big of a difference the location makes. Our favorite location is the one location in Schaumburg, IL. Just to clarify, I still love Lou&apos;s and always will. I just don&apos;t like this location at all. If you ever get the chance to try a different location I would definitely recommend it!"
4,"We were excited to try this out after going to Giordano&apos;s last night and wanted to get a comparison. When we went in at 11:30, the restaurants was about 20% full in the front open patio and only a few tables seated inside. The hostess called out B25 and the male host walked us to the complete back of the restaurant in a section that looked closed, and absolutely no one was seated. In addition, he ushered us to a table that was by far the smallest table in the section, slammed up against the wall by the kitchen. This was completely unacceptable, considering that the restaurant was so slow at the time . &quot;Is this table ok?&quot;. No, it is not! Please move us to the open air patio where everyone isle is being seated. 

Our server came to take our order, nice guy but devoid of any personality. And that&apos;s how out meal got started. So now we were sitting here and felt unwelcome, not going to speculate why, but kinda irritating.

As for the pizza. Really good, and in my opinion better than Giordano&apos;s. We had the classic and it had an amazing crust and loaded with cheese and Lou&apos;s sausage. For the two of us, a small was plenty big, and we really had to force ourselves to finish it. Hopefully, better service next time, but that won&apos;t make us miss this awesome pizza the next time we are in town."
2,"I hope you do not have any other plans when visiting this place. The wait time is ridiculous. I was told that there was 35 minute wait for a table--I waited an hour and 10 minutes. Once seated, I waited an additional 15 minutes for my waitress to first appear, who also told me that it&apos;ll be 20-35 minutes for the pizza to cook. I stated that I will just order to go because I had a destination to go to. So I ordered, but I waited for an hour and 15 minutes for the pizza to arrive; I was actually in the process of walking out, and literally, once I was at the front door, my pizza came. But I still left--I paid for and took the pizza with me, and STILL tipped my waitress (-3 stars). 

The pizza was decent--not even worth talking about in detail (I had Giordano&apos;s the next day and the service and pizza was better)."
4,"Lou&apos;s was on my list of must try Chicago&apos;s deep dish pizzas. 

Thankfully, there are a multitude of locations in downtown Chicago. The smaller ones always have a line stretching all the way down the block, so expect around two hour wait time. 

We visited the biggest chain establishment in the area, which offered a ton of seating. We came at 2pm Monday and waited 5-10 minutes for a table of two, even though there were plenty of empty tables. This location is severely understaffed, which was the biggest downside of our experience. We waited over 15 minutes for an overworked server to come to our table after we sat down. The table that sat after us was served first, which added to our hangriness. We ordered just the deep dish pizza, so starving for 45 minutes while it was cooking was torture. Get drinks or appetizers to pass the time. 

The place is super casual, with a huge bar and TVs hanging all over. Outside seating definitely offers a nicer experience during great weather. Family restrooms are available.

The one detail that was extremely off-putting was the smell of the place. I sensed it upon entering and it persisted the entire time we were dinning. An unpleasant, old, funky stench of cheap furniture that has been doused in cheese that has gone bad. I&apos;m very sensitive to scents, so a pleasant aroma of the environment is always an important factor. 

Now to our pizza. We got the medium classic Lou plus mushrooms. The size definitely feeds 3 people (two big slices each), but we were starving after a full day of activity, so we pigged out at 3 slices each. The buttery crust was lighter than Giordano&apos;s (which we had the day before and did not enjoy). Not greasy or heavy at all, which was a great surprise. A generous amount of sausage and mushrooms. Good proportion of cheese to other ingredients. Plenty of tomato sauce and whole plum tomatoes on top. Definitely not dry (like Giordano&apos;s, which also felt pre-made/frozen). A satisfying pizza altogether--very juicy and flavorful. We didn&apos;t notice how quickly each slice disappeared on our tongues. 

Wish we had space for the deep dish cookie, but the pizza stuffs you for the rest of the day."
4,"What a great experience in the frigid 19Â° weather of outdoor dining during Covid!!  Roberto took our first Lou Malnati Deep Dish Pizza experience to a whole new level. His service and attention to detail were above and beyond what was expected during a blustery evening. The pizza met all levels of expectation, but the service took it over the top!!"
