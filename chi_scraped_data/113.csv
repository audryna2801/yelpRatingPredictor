5,"It was my first time coming to Roka Akor. I had heard amazing things about the ambiance, food and diversity in the way the cooking was done. All of these things were beyond my expectations. 

From the moment you walk in, it feels like a luxurious  fine dining. You walk past the grill and ambient lighting to find seating that pairs well with the mood in the room. 

We started with an edamame and vegetable tempura appetizer. The edamame was firm and warm with speckles of sea salt, very tasty. The lightly battered tofu paired well with the avocado and wasabi spread and I highly recommend it. The veggie tempura is a unique taste. 

Next was the Hamachi Serrano Chili sushi, a favorite. It was very smooth and rich in taste, paired perfectly with the spicy mayo. 

The main entree was the skirt steak, ordered medium and the meat was juicy and tender at the same time. It came with a pairing of soy glaze and was melting in our mouths. Very good!

Last was the pairing of a latte and the chocolate molten cake. This was epic for two reasons. It came with a dusting of roasted hazelnuts and the mini crunchy chocolate balls as very rich in taste and color. 

There is so much precision that goes into every dish here and I highly recommend this place to anyone for an experience. 

To add, the customer service was extraordinary. 
I will be back very soon."
5,"OMG you guys! Roka Akor totally nailed this pandemic Covid thing. We didn&apos;t want to miss our annual anniversary dinner night, so we got Roka to go. That&apos;s right - we took home Japanese A5 wagyu in little boxes through curbside pickup, and ate it on our own dining table. They even have dinner packages that you can buy - you can choose from Steak, Seafood or Wagyu. How amazing is that?!? Thank you to the wonder people at Roka for helping us through these strange 2020 times. Without further ado...

Steak Package includes Heirloom Tomato Salad, Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings, Spicy Tuna Maki, 6 oz NY Strip Steak with Truffle Aioli, and Fingerling Potatoes. At the time of this review, it costs $35/person.
*** The Steak Package was a bargain for all the food you get. Everything was delicious, individually packaged, and fresh. The truffle aioli is EVERYTHING! I dipped anything I could in it. So so good. The manager allowed us to sub the wagyu kimchi dumplings for chicken skewers (we are not kimchi fans), which we are very appreciative. 

Wagyu Package includes Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings, 4 oz Japanese A5 Takamori Drunken Wagyu, Brussels Sprouts, and Fingerling Potatoes. At the time of this review, the price is $99/person.
*** Again, the Wagyu package, although expensive, was a downright bargain for what you get. The steak alone would have been almost double the price!! The meat was melt in your mouth buttery smooth and we loved that it came with all the dipping sauces and salts. The smoked salt was my favorite! 

We also ordered the Yellowtail Sashimi, Toro Tartare, and Escolar Tataki appetizers. Each one was AMAZING.

The only thing we didn&apos;t think traveled well for carryout was the Japanese Mushroom Rice Hot Pot with Fresh Shaved Truffles. The truffles and garnish were all wilted and steamed in the box. It would have been better if they separated the truffles and garnish in a separate container for you to put on top yourself.

And of course, we got an Ube Pot to go. These purply puddings are soooo delicious! I could buy a vat of this and just eat it all day. 

Great job on everything Roka Akor!! Appreciate your efforts in keeping us safe!

We did not try the Seafood Package."
5,"This place has really good oysters and sushi, really liked the quality of ingredients. They also offer sit down dining but with social distancing and that&apos;s good. Staff is helpful and accomodating. Would recommend"
4,"Definitely a bit more on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for and the food is good quality! We had a party of 6 and were able to find a reservation fairly easily. Since we were such a large party, we basically ordered everything on the menu and the portion sizes were really large! Couldn&apos;t finish a lot of our food and left feeling very full. Only downside was that we were eating indoors and it seemed really packed and not COVID friendly so we were a bit concerned as the restaurant got busier later in the night.

Overall a great restaurant and you really can&apos;t go wrong with anything that you order from here!"
2,"A couple of my girl friends and I decided to have a Friday night dinner at Roka Akor in the city. I had never been to this restaurant and decided to look it up on Yelp (my go-to guide for everything nowadays) to see what they had to offer. From what it looked like, the menu looked delicious and I&apos;m a huge Japanese food fan so how could it go wrong? 

We started off with the Prime Beef Takati and honestly, I wasn&apos;t the biggest fan of this dish. The presentation was great, however, the meat was a bit too chewy for me (and I&apos;m not the biggest meat eater to begin with) so my tastebuds were not impressed by this one. My friends echoed the same sentiment so we were a little disappointed in this dish. Not to say that if you&apos;re all about it, give it a try and see for yourself! You might like it more than we did and maybe we just caught them on a bad day but who knows. 

I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Breast for my main dish of the evening and this was better. I didn&apos;t realize that the dish didn&apos;t come with rice so had I known that beforehand, I would&apos;ve ordered some. I kept waiting around for the waiter to come by after my dish was brought out to me to order the rice, but by that time, I was starving and just wanted to finish my food; so I ate it sans rice. My friends ordered different dishes from me and it was slightly better for them but they still weren&apos;t too thrilled about it either. We didn&apos;t order dessert to cap off the night so I have nothing for y&apos;all there.

Overall, not the worst food in the world, but for the price, I expected a lot more, hence the two out of five stars. It&apos;s very hard for me to rate anything lower than a 3 but I have to be honest or else, what good am I doing for the community. The ambiance was great and we dined outdoors on the street. Staff was friendly and nice so nothing wrong there. Would I come back? Probably not any time soon but I&apos;m always up for second chances so who knows! Stay tuned, folks."
3,"This restaurant did not adhere to COVID guidelines 
Though the main dining area was not crowded and I felt safe in it, the bar area was completely unacceptable 
It was crowded with people standing elbow to elbow with no masks on!! NOTGOOD!!"
4,"Beautiful spot. Staff was attentive, food was delicious.....although they could expand their vegetarian offerings. Loved how we weren&apos;t rushed out after the meal, and the server kept our drinks full. Also, they had great music that wasn&apos;t too loud."
4,"I&apos;m catching up on Yelp reviews as they are long overdue, but better late than never! I went to Roka Akor for happy hour on a Friday before going to see Star Wars Rise of Skywalker. Sigh... Luckily, Roka Akor was not a bad choice before seeing a roller coaster ride of a film that made a lot of people sick. I arrived around 5:30pm and sat at the bar. There were people seated at tables, but I had the bar to myself. The atmosphere is a modern, chic, dimly lit place. 

I ordered the Modern Nigiri Plate, Hamachi Serrano Roll, and Prime Beef Skewers. I thought the Nigiri Plate was the best part of my meal as it was super fresh, flavorful, and had a diverse selection. The Hamachi Serrano Roll was good and had a small kick. The Prime Beef Skewers came out very late and were lukewarm so I think they were sitting under the warmer for a while. 

The bartender who served me was awesome and the only complaint about service is the Prime Beef Skewers coming out very late. Prices are expensive, like when a California Roll is $13 expensive, but the seafood quality is very good. Alcohol is pricey as well. I didn&apos;t really see any good deals with their Japanese Whisky so I chose to go with Bourbon instead. But if you are looking for Japanese Whisky, they have a big selection. They offer a lot of food options at Happy Hour with a few drink specials, which is great if you are hungry. They also have a number of steaks, which I would be interested in trying someday. Overall, Roka Akor is a very good sushi place that is pricey in the River North Neighborhood, but it is worth a shot!"
5,"I meant to update this FOREVER ago but been so busy I totally forgot. Roka is amazing. Not only did they genuinely apologize but gave me and my partner amazing service and fhe food was amazing as always! Highly recommend the chef&apos;s tasting menu. 
Thank you for going above &amp; beyond and re affirming that Roka is in fact one of the best places in Chicago."
5,"I came here for Valentine&apos;s day and overall really enjoyed the experience. It was super crowded as expected but we had reservations and were able to get seated within a few minutes of our reservation time. We were given different seating options but opted for sushi bar seating which honestly was a lot better than a table because personally I think it&apos;s nicer and more intimate to sit next to someone vs across from them. Plus we could smell and see all the delicious food that was cooked right in front of us!

That day, they had their valentine&apos;s day prix fixe menu vs regular menu and we opted for the latter. We ordered the wagyu beef and kimchi dumplings ($11), traditional nagiri platter (6 pieces for $26), and Korean spiced lamb cutlets $38). Everything was wonderful. We loved the nagiri, the fish tasted so fresh and delicious. The lamb cutlets were sooo good, perfectly tender but also crispy and very flavorful. We also got a bottle of cherry bouquet sake ($35) which was slightly sweet and crisp in flavor.

We thoroughly enjoyed this meal although it was a bit pricey. The ambiance is beautiful and great for a night out. The staff is friendly and helpful. They have a HH which might be worth checking out."
4,Amazing sushi! Their Japanese fried chicken is very tasty. Wagyu beef is amazing! I do wish they had some type of mashed potatoes. Amazing mocktails.
4,"Likes
- amberjack nigiri was amazing
- lamb cutlet were medium rare and tasty despite the fattiness
- dynamite  scallop maki was better than the hamachi jalapenos maki
- crispy brussel sprouts are good but could be less saucy and salty
-seared scallop appetizer was very juicy
- night in Kyoto cocktail was tasty
-i had a bite of the chocolate cake, banana cake, and strawberry yuzu sorbet. The sorbet and chocolate cake were the best of the three

Dislikes
- waiter misheard our lamb cutlet order for ribs and have us major attitude when we sent back the ribs. Later the manager came back and gave the ribs on the house. It tasted ok. It was not seasoned on the sides just the top and bottom and then cut after cooked.
- mushroom and corn sides were just ok. I&apos;d skip next time

Next time:
I wanna try the green tea custard"
5,"Had an incredible experience at Roka last night, with giant thanks owed to our server, Gary, who started our special evening off with a celebratory champagne toast.

The restaurants specialty is Japanese cuisine prepared on the 12 foot robata grill. The open air kitchen fills the restaurant with rich, mesquite charcoal -- fitting, as the name &quot;Roka&quot; translates to &quot;to gather around the fire&quot;.

We started with a round of fresh shigoku oysters with a lime garnish and charred shishito peppers in a light ponzu sauce. The smokey flavor of the grill really comes out in these.

Next we shared the yellowtail sashimi, which also rests in that delicate ponzu to compliment the peppers, and the lobster maki. Dipping these in soy sauce would be practically criminal -- the flavor is perfect exactly as prepared!

Lastly, we shared the grilled pork belly with miso mustard &amp; pickled cauliflower. It was incredibly flavorful and rich -- the 1900 degree flames from the robata grill didn&apos;t nearly dry out this amazingly moist cut.

But my favorite dish of the night was the Yuzu Miso marinated black cod (which, Gary explained to us is not actually cod at all, it&apos;s a sablefish!). This fish has an amazingly smooth, velvety texture with a high oil content which makes it ideal for smoking. The thick but delicate flakes hold in all the flavor, and then melts apart like butter in your mouth. I swear, I had an existential experience with this dish.

Finally, an additional toast compliments of our wonderful server, our evening closed with the fluffiest, creamiest, smoothest sorbet I think I&apos;ve ever had.

We had such a great time that we had to take a moment to speak with assistant GM and sommelier, Neal Sage, to offer our praise for the entire experience. We can&apos;t wait to gather around the fire at Roka again!"
5,"Again, this is the best happy hour in Chicago. This time I tried the Signature Tataki Trio and the Lobster Roll.  

The Signature Tataki Trio was delicious. It is one piece of each butterfish, salmon and yellowtail. Very much worth it! 

I also opted for the Lobster Roll off of the dinner menu. I love lobster so I had some high expectations. This was very good, but not quite what I was expecting. The lobster was balled up on top of the roll. It was good, but I have had better Lobster Rolls. 

Looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu as I visit Chicago."
5,"Dined hear around New Years &amp; oh my Gosh was it delicious! The ambiance has a chill vibe with low lighting &amp; the sushi bar has an open concept. 

The service was excellent as well. The items on the menu are meant to be shared. Between the two of us, we ordered the edamame, chicken skewers, brussel sprouts, and the salmon &amp; Avocado roll. I had no complaints about anything. The flavoring in the brussel sprouts was so addicting. Probably the best I&apos;ve had. The edamame was perfectly salted &amp; the sushi melted in your mouth. 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, definitely add this to your list of places to try!"
5,"Tempura roll always delicious for people with shellfish allergies.
Truffle butte sirloin steak always a great option . It delicious . 
Talk to Jorge at the bar or Faviola on the main floor, you can&apos;t go wrong."
4,"I have visited the spot a couple of weeks back as it was my friend&apos;s birthday. So in general we liked the food there, it is fresh and tastes good. The presentation of the dish is cool! Apart from that we had to sit in a rather cold tent."
5,"Roka Akor. Is the best restaurant in the world. They have steak, sushi, crab legs, the list does on and on. The service is incredible! I can&apos;t speak highly enough about this place! Thank you Roka Akor Chicago... we also love the one in Arizona"
5,"Food is phenomenal. Ambience is great for a date night. Pricey but worth it. I got the grilled pork belly and snake river farms American wagyu sirloin. The wagyu is 6 oz and comes with bone marrow and truffle aioli.The wagyu is pretty good, it&apos;s very tender and juicy. The truffle aioli is great, definitely pairs well with the wagyu. The bone marrow is so savory. 

Happy hour review:
Hamachi Serrano roll with wasabi aioli was fresh and delicious. I don&apos;t like wasabi at all but didn&apos;t mind it on this.
Wagyu beef &amp; kimchi dumplings- these had the perfect amount of beef and kimchi and they paired well together
Crispy fried squid with chili and lime - pieces are big and crispy
Prime beef skewers - very tender and juicy

Overall, the happy hour is great! There&apos;s a good selection to pick from. Next time I will be trying the Japanese wagyu."
5,"An experience I&apos;ll never forget (mostly because it was my first time having Malort after moving to Chicago). It was a great happy hour spot to get some sushi &amp; drinks with good apps, including edamame, and awesome service"
