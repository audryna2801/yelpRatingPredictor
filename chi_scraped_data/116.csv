5,"One thing we love about Middle Eastern food is that there are so many great vegetarian options as well as meat dishes so everyone can get what they want and still feel satisfied.  At Sultan&apos;s Market, this is especially true and their large menu variety proves it! 

We tried a lot of different menu items because we couldn&apos;t decide on just a few things. Everything looked, smelled, and sounded so good when we got here (and ended up tasting amazing too!) The menu is very reasonably priced as well!

 Starters: Baked Spinach Pie, Baked Meat Pie, Baked Egg &amp; Cheese Pie, Baked Zattar Bread (they warmed these up for us and we tried them all right out of the oven, they were delicious!)

 Soups: Gradma Zarifa&apos;s Lentil Soup and Mama Masada Chicken Soup (both were tasty and perfect for the cool weather)

 Entrees: Falafel Sandwich (I could eat this everyday for lunch), Vegetarian Combo Dinner with Falafel, Tabouli salad, and Curry Rice, Meat Combo Dinner with Lamb Shawarma, Chicken Shawarma, Kefta Kabob, Tabouli salad, and Lentil Rice

 Sides: Pita bread with Hummus and Baba Ganuj

 Dessert: Baklava (if you know you know)

We went to their new location in Logan Square and were blown away by how nice of a space it was! They have a beautiful interior, with a large patio in the back, and even tables on the roof. We want to go back at night to see the lanterns lit up!"
5,"During the COVID19 lockdown I got a craving for Mediterranean. My friends in Wicker obsess over Sultan&apos;s so I thought I would give it a try! I ordered the Chicken Shawerma plate with the Jerusalem salad and curry rice. This dinner plate comes with hummus and pita bread as well. Let me tell you that this plate is a feast, a delicious feast for an amazing price. I was able to turn my plate into two separate meals.

This is an incredible local spot! I will definitely be back."
5,"I was totally impressed with this place! I ordered in advance for pickup, and was pleasantly surprised to see that there&apos;s an entire self-serve cold bar (with covid precautions in place even!) with great looking food. 

My order was up quickly. The food was fantastic. I can&apos;t wait to go back and taste more of the food."
5,"Great food, I enjoyed the lamb schwarma (think that&apos;s how you spell it). The staff was very nice and accommodating. Went to the location in Logan I believe on California Ave. I don&apos;t even like lentil soup but there&apos;s was delicious! Love the sauces too. Plenty of beverage options as well I&apos;m pretty sure you can buy the spices."
5,"This review is specifically for the Logan Square location but there isn&apos;t a Yelp page for it yet. HOLY MOLY - SULTAN&apos;S MARKET BLOWS EVERY OTHER MIDDLE EASTERN RESTAURANT OUT OF THE WATER! My husband and I went twice in one week because we both loved it so much. On our first visit, we both tried the Chicken Pita with a piece of the baklava. On the second visit, we split the Vegetarian Plate (more than enough for 2). The falafel was the best I have ever had. My experience with falafel has never been very good. It&apos;s something I always want to like but it falls short. This falafel was not dry at all. The hummus is excellent and the curry rice is so tasty. The prices are also super affordable. I wish we could eat here daily!"
4,"Our most favorit restaurant in Chicago！！！tast, stuffs everything perfect ！！！！！
I miss there everytime！！！"
4,"Funky, urban, neighborhood vibe, and super budget friendly...

Here&apos;s where you go for Middle Eastern food that&apos;s authentic, fresh, and budget friendly. Take note, it&apos;s cash only, so be ready to pay up (we ended up having to get money out of a nearby cash machine, and it cost us $2). 

The menu wasn&apos;t huge, and really a variation of many combinations using the same ingredients. You can order off the menu or the salad bar. The salad bar is only $5.99/lb. What a bargain!

Hubby and I each tried a couple of different things. He got the chicken shawerma dinner. It had seasoned chicken with a multitude of flavors that exploded in my mouth. He couldn&apos;t decide on what salad to get, so the chef insisted he try both. The salads were a mix of Jerusalem salad and tabuli salad, so his plate ended up with a mix of cucumbers, lettuce, onions, tahini, lemon, and lots of spices. I tried everything. Wow...so amazing! All the dinners are served with pita bread and choice of rice (hidden under the meat in my photo). Hubby tried a mix of the basmati and lentil rice. I couldn&apos;t get a sense for how the riced tasted since it blended with the chicken. The pita was nice and strong--perfect for making a pita sandwich. 

I couldn&apos;t decide what to get and opted for the salad bar. That way I could throw a little bit of everything in a bowl. I also ended up with chicken shawerma in my salad. So many fresh veggies! I&apos;m cucumber obsessed, so that&apos;s a good thing. I don&apos;t know what everything was that I ate, but I loved everything! The hummus was thick, meaning it was most likely fresh and homemade. It was mild in flavor with a bit of paprika mixed in.

As far as the decor, the restaurant had a lot of character and was filled with lots of funky lamps, and unique details from the ceilings to the floors. The building is old, and the restaurant has been around for a long time. But, it was spotlessly clean and had a nice smell to it. 

The bathrooms are unisex with fun graffiti all over the walls. Beware of the smaller tight bathroom. I watched my hubby attempt to make it into that one, and it was just too small for his comfort level.

Service was overly friendly with a fun urban vibe. 

Take note: If you&apos;re planning a big make out session with your partner, the spices in the food are pretty overpowering. Make sure you and your partner both eat the same thing - LOL!"
2,"They didn&apos;t have their mask on when we came in. Was confused on where to pick up the order, there was a group of guys talking and laughing and took them a while to attend me. The food was cold when we got it."
4,"Went back during COVID for carry out - it&apos;s still as good as i remember it to be . Falafel sandwich , meat combo , kefta entree , and the soup. Make sure you grab sauces on the side to complete your meal."
4,"Holy smokes I&apos;m so happy I discovered Sultan&apos;s Market! This dirt cheap, cash only spot, serves up some generously portioned Mediterranean food.

I decided to order my usual chicken shawarma dinner and it did not disappoint. For $8, your receive chicken, your choice of rice, your choice of salad, a generous scoop of hummus, and pita bread. There&apos;s nowhere else in the Chicago city limits that I have found this much good Mediterranean food for less than $8. I decided on the curry rice and Jerusalem salad. The hummus, tahini, and hot sauce were all very good as well. 

Now in Chicagoland I still prefer Pita Inn over all other options, but from where I currently live, and if I didn&apos;t have a car, Sultan&apos;s Market, within steps of the Damen Blue Line would be my #1 choice for chicken shawarma."
5,"Delicious and cheap. Best lentil soup anywhere, also tried the egg and cheese bread which was great dipped into the soup."
5,"I&apos;ve been coming to this place for over 20 years, the food is consistent, everything is fresh, delicious, and seasoned amazingly! It&apos;s everything you&apos;d expect this place to be and more!!! I had introduced this place to my son when he was a toddler and it&apos;s amazing to see that they are still in business, trust me it&apos;s not for nothing!! They offer the community an escape to another world with each bite. Take my review to heart and try this place!"
3,"I had been wanting to try this place for a while now...thanks to their outdoor decor and the advertisements we see all the time on the benches around wicker park blue line junction. 

The only cash policy did kind of threw me off a couple of times but I finally tried it for lunch. 

It&apos;s not as fancy inside as the outside suggests, a rather casual spot tbh. They have pre-made cafeteria-style buffet options to choose from or you could just order separately as well.. which I did. 

I think I got the falafel pita sandwich, baklava, and a pop. It all came to be about $8 which wasn&apos;t very bad. Sandwich was nice, baklava was alright.
They did have some dipping condiments at the self serve water station - tahini maybe. That was tasty. 

Overall, more of a spot to grab quick lunch, dinner or take out. Perhaps more convenient for people living within walking distance from Sultan&apos;s. I&apos;d probably return if I&apos;m in the area too otherwise not worth the trek."
5,Great food. The chicken and hummus are seasoned perfectly. Large portions (can be shared or rationed).
5,"Mediterranean is a great catering option if you want something that caters to a variety of dietary restrictions. Vegetarian, vegan, nut free, gluten free - they&apos;ve got you covered. And, if you do it through Sultan&apos;s, it&apos;s reasonably priced too.

Our venue placed the order for us, but everything arrived as requested and on time. We opted for the signature dinner option and added falafel to the order. Since it wasn&apos;t our only food option, I ordered for half of the headcount. The falafel went fast, in hindsight, I would&apos;ve ordered a little more as it was popular with meat and non meat eaters alike. The amount of chicken and rice was more than plentiful; honestly we could&apos;ve gotten by with only one catering tray of rice. 

Several people complimented the food and asked where we got it, which always pleases a host. I&apos;d definitely use Sultan&apos;s for catering again."
4,"Wicker Park is a cool area to visit in Chicago. Of course, I tried the falafel sandwich. It was really good. It&apos;s a small mom and pop shop. Service could have been more welcoming and better, but the falafel sandwich was really great. The chicken shawarma plate was good too.

The price is even better! The portions are worth the cheap price!"
5,Every time I arrive in Chi  I stop here things have never changed everything is always delicious... falafel yummy
5,"One of my favorite places to eat in the neighborhood. Amazing middle eastern food! I love the chicken shawarma, basmati rice, hummus, baba ganoush, and falafel. It&apos;s honestly the best baba I&apos;ve had in the states and one of the only good falafels I&apos;ve had in the states. Huge portions, low prices. Note, it&apos;s cash only. If you forget cash, you can order on Ritual with a credit card."
5,Sultan&apos;s is the GOAT full stop. Yelp wants me to write more but there&apos;s nothing more to say
5,"You can&apos;t beat it... the prices, the quality, and the quantity.

You see the reviews! Sultan&apos;s is top notch food and price in a sea of overpriced foods in the surround area. 

Chicken Schwarma: This is often my go-to when it comes to Mediterranean food. Simple, quick, easy, delicious, and flavorful."
