5,"Come here to enjoy a good meal! The place is not so big, but it&apos;s quite cozy. The staff pays attention to each client. As for precaution: all tables are treated with sanitizer, the staff wears masks and keep safe and comfortable distance. Do not forget to bring masks with you: without them you will not be allowed to enter the cafe. The food is good. Burgers are big and hearty - that&apos;s all you need for such a nice price! I was really delighted after visiting this spot, so, I could recommend it without hesitation!"
5,My absolute favorite place in Chicago! The bangers and mash and bubble and squeak are my go to orders. the servers are so kind and I&apos;ve only ever had amazing dining and service experiences. Support them and bixi beer in this weird pandemic time!
5,"Started with a scotch egg and followed with their vegetable korma. I had their burger for entree, which was so rich and delicious. The Scotch egg was cooked to perfection. Flavorful, perfectly cooked with a nice mustard sauce on the side. This place makes hearty meals that am I absolutely in love with!"
3,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday. The ambiance is great with  dark lighting and sort of an upscale pub vibe. The food however is pretty average. I would recommend making reservations. Started off with the soft pretzel ($11) as an appetizer per our waiter&apos;s recommendation. The pretzel was normal sized and came with a creamy mustard dip. This was pretty  flavorful but I think $11 for a pretzel is a bit much. 

For dinner we got the burger ($20) and bone marrow ($16) to share. We added an egg to the burger which was a $2 up charge. The beef patty was very thick and juicy however overall I didn&apos;t think this burger was all that flavorful. The only thing that added additional flavor were the caramelized onions but that&apos;s it. There wasn&apos;t even cheese in it. It is pretty heavy and I would recommend sharing but honestly $22 for a burger is super overpriced. It does come with fries which are nice and crispy and aioli is delicious. The bone marrow was a letdown because for $16 you get a tiny amount of actual bone marrow but 4 pieces of bread. We could only eat 2 pieces of bread cause there just wasn&apos;t enough bone marrow to put on it. This dish is supposed to have a &quot;salad&quot;  (as stated in the description) but its not a true salad, just a few leaves sprinkled in there. 

Overall I think this place is overpriced. On the plus side free street parking is available and I believe you can park in the movie theater garage also for $2."
5,"We were a group of six friends dining together and had a really wonderful evening here.

They have a really large and varied beer selection.  Though we were planning on going to a local tasting later that night, we almost didn&apos;t need to given the vast beer menu.

We started with some small bites to share.  We had the Virginia PEANUTS, Sriracha, Worcestershire, Brown Sugar, the Herb Marinated OLIVES, Dinon White Anchovy, Citrus Oil and the Pot of Assorted House-Made PICKLES.  Of the three, I would order the peanuts and the pickles again.  Hubby loved the peanuts and I loved the pickles.  The pickles are not just cumbers but eggs and onions and stuff.  

Hubby and I both had the burger.  It was huge and delicious.  Loved the caramelized onions that sat atop it.  We both made it a cheeseburger but you certainly don&apos;t need to.  Another at our table had it topped with an egg.  Think I will try that next time.  The accompanying chips with the malt vinegar mayo were excellent.  I certainly ate way too many of them.  Others had the fish and chips and the mussels.  I heard very happy sounds from those diners as well.

We all loved the vibe of the place.  Casual, young and hip.  The staff were all great."
5,I never even noticed this restaurant until a friend suggested we go there. We were a table of 6 and got seated right away. Food came out relatively quick and I had the banger and it was amazing! My husband had their burger and he loved it. Everyone in our table enjoyed their food. Would definitely recommend &amp; come back again.
4,"Great restaurant/bar for a date night. Especially with the theater being across the street. Parking was very easy. The food tasted really good, but the prices are expensive for what it is. Approximately $20 for a burger, $14 for veggie mash potatoes (bubble and squeak), and got a sausage/mashed potatoes dish that also costed more than it should. Our waitress was very nice and helpful."
4,"We came on a Friday night without reservations but thankfully we came around 6:00pm and the upstairs dining area was empty. We had it all to ourselves for a few minutes. Then two more tables were filled before we left. 
Casey, our waiter, was very nice and attentive. He spent time talking with us. 

Hubby ordered the fish and chips. This is Haddock and fries. Very good. 

I ordered the Pasty (pork belly) and was delighted. It&apos;s very delicious. Comes with a scoop of  apple, raisin chutney; curry veggies; and salad greens. All the flavors on one plate. Great umami effect!

This was our anniversary dinner and we were thankful to find Owen and Engine on Yelp. Come give them a try. They&apos;ve been in Lincoln Park for 9 years 

Gotta come back for their burgers as they are known for them and our waiter highly recommends them."
4,"First things first, this is a very cool spot. Great atmosphere that has elements of the British pub thing, along with a modern touch. 

Food is fresh, flavorful, and made to order. Nearly everything on the menu is made in house. 

We got a table for 4 upstairs surprisingly quickly on a busy Friday night. Real nice, wide-ranging drink menu. 

All 4 of us were happy with our meals. My burger was cooked to perfection, but definitely could&apos;ve used more seasoning. The gnocchi was top notch, as were the mashed potatoes, which were made with cheese. Just delicious. 

Service was great as well. The lone knock are the food prices. When I can get an equal or better burger down the street at Kuma&apos;s, or downtown at Au Cheval, for about half the price, why would I pay $20+ here?

As good an experience as it was, those price points may keep this from being a regular stop."
5,"Owen and engine isn&apos;t your typical burger. 

This burger is a new dining experience that I didn&apos;t know existed. It&apos;s somewhere between eating a burger and eating a steak..topped with a fancy bun. 
Only come here on tuesdays as the beer and shot special is too good to pass up."
5,"A very authentic British pub experience. We stopped in on a gray Sunday (very London-esque). A friend had posted on Instagram the night before, a photo of her burger and immediately, my partner said &quot;we&apos;re going there tomorrow!&quot;. 

I ordered a beer from one of their great local selections on tap as well as some imports of good libations from across the pond, but I&apos;m a sucker for supporting local breweries. The server enlightened me that the beer I ordered from tap was also available in cask format that they infused with cherries. Curious to try the two side-by-side, I asked for a sample. Totally mind-blowing experience and I honestly would go back for a full glass. A testament to the unique touch this establishment brings coupled with the willingness of the server to share what they were doing. 

The food, oh god, the food. Two in our party ordered the burger and I ordered the fish and chips. My fish was super fresh and flaky. I loved the generous filets they provided along with the two dipping sauces. The batter could maybe be tweaked a bit to adhere more to the fish so it doesn&apos;t slide right off, but I was still happy with the dish overall. The chips were super crisp and well-seasoned. Great with the aioli provided. 

Then I took a bite of the burger. Rivaling, or better than Au Cheval, this burger sang on my palate. The caramelized onions provided such a deep flavor profile and showcased the quality of the beef, paired with some creaminess from the cheese and crisp lettuce, and the soft buttered bun, there was no complaint to be had. 

Would certainly come back--to try some of the specials they have on weekdays too!"
5,"Great ambience, attentive and friendly staff, good beer and delicious food! What more can you ask for? Their burgers were so juicy and flavorful! The bangers and mash was delicious! I particularly enjoyed the mashed potatoes and gravy. My friends and I enjoyed our dinner and would definitely come back for More!"
3,"Cool vibes. Large drink selection. decent food.

Food: Ordered the burger with fries. The patty was thick and juicy. Cooked perfectly to order. I&apos;d give it 4 stars but downgraded to 3 for the price. I felt full after eating my meal but felt that the price was a bit steep for just a burger. They do have a great special on Tuesday&apos;s that discounts the burger and includes beer and a shot so I recommend getting the burger then! The regal cinema across the street has a deal on Tuesdays too for discounted movies.

Service: excellent! My server accurately remembered the order of 6 different burgers without taking notes and checked up on us frequently for water refills. Could not have asked for better service."
4,"4/14/18 

Great experience for my first and only British gastropub.

Just like there&apos;s a breakfast burger or sandwich, when you taste that scotch egg, you&apos;re going to wish you had that egg for breakfast the next day! 

Burger was filling.. hardly juicy. I also prefer traditional or thick cut bacon on my burger but to each their own. 

If you like sausages, you can&apos;t go wrong with bangers and mash, another classic UK food like Scotch egg. 

I personally don&apos;t like dining in the dark but I still very much enjoyed the classy British pub interior."
5,"I live in the neighborhood, and love Owen &amp; Engine.

Owen &amp; Engine is going for an &apos;English pub&apos; vibe with an upscale twist, and they nail it at every turn.

The atmosphere is dark library, cozy for a brunch, lunch, or dinner.

The food is classic English pub grub, with those good Indian flavors included. I love the Bubble and Squeak and the Korma.

The beer menu includes some English favorites that are not easy to find in Chicago (shoutout to the Charles Wells Bombadier).

Cheers, Owen &amp; Engine!"
4,"We really liked our food - I wish we had been hungrier because the portions are good. My wife started with a Scotch egg and felt it was the best she has had - 5 stars. My wife then had a Cornish Pastry which she gave 4 stars, great crust and delicious filling. I had the Fish and Chips and I would give it 4 stars; they use Halibut for the fish and the chips were on point. The service was 5 star; Casey was great.

We had just come from Maplewood and were not familiar with the area. It is a very short walk from Maplewood to Owen &amp; Engine. Unfortunately, we had some food at Maplewood and we were just not that hungry. I would do it again but get to Maplewood earlier - skip the food, and head to Owen &amp; Engine with a huge appetite."
5,"First time in and this place is going to be a clear favorite for me in the future. 5 stars hands down. Can&apos;t wait to come back and try the burger. It looked awesome.

Food/drink: 5 stars - get the ploughman&apos;s! The board was fill with delicious cheese, cured meats, bread, pickles and more. Everything is made in house and tastes excellent. I also tried the pickled veggies as a side which were awesome. They have a diverse draft list which isn&apos;t too intimidating either. Finished off dinner with an old fashioned which competes with any cocktail bar around.

Service: 5 stars - I sat at the bar and the staff was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. The recommendations were spot on and added to the experience.

Atmosphere: 4.5 stars - the front door almost looked hidden which was pretty cool. It&apos;s winter time so by 6:30 it was already dark out but the front bar was lit with candles and dim lighting. I&apos;d like to come back during the day to check it out further as well as the upstairs bar."
5,"Damn that&apos;s a good burger! After grabbing a few drinks at the bar and asking the bartender what he recommended, he let us know that they were known for the burger. I must say, it did not disappoint. That patty was so dang flavorful and the caramelized onions added a rich sweetness to the burger. My friend said that he likes this burger better than the more hyped up Au Cheval Burger and I think he is onto something. On my trip we only made it to small Cheval with no wait which I really really enjoyed. If I had to wait an hour to three hours for an Au Cheval burger I can&apos;t imagine it being that much better making the wait justifiable. This burger also seemed more higher end than the small Cheval burger which is expected given its price point. If I was a local I think I&apos;d opt for this joint 9/10 times over Au Cheval."
5,"An authentic British gastro pub experience. From the dark mood lighting to the staff who greet you with a friendly welcome.

The Burger - You might have heard of Au Cheval famed burger but I&apos;ll argue that the best burger in Chicago is found here. The caramelized onions have a deep rich color along with the sweetness that comes from prolong cooking. The meat is tender and juicy and is topped with a bun that goes in harmony with all the ingredients. Score of 5/5

Fish &amp; Chips - Flakey fish that comes with two dipping sauces. Though the fish tasted fresh, the batter of the fish wasn&apos;t much to write home about. Score of 3.5/5

Scotch egg - For its price and only having a small portion size, I can&apos;t wholeheartedly recommend this. The taste was definitely pretty good but we were left wanting for more after finishing this. Score of 3/5

Bangers &amp; Mash - Bangers yay! Mash nay... The sausages came in two flavors. One was rabbit and the other pork. Both brought their own unique flavor dance in our mouth. The mash... Was just mash and sadly didn&apos;t add to the sausages. Score of 4/5

Overall a hidden gem with some great food and pub ambience for the late night."
4,"The best part about this place is the atmosphere! Downstairs we had drinks at a pretty hip neighborhood bar. Then upstairs we had dinner in what felt like someone&apos;s English home - very romantic.

The service was good and friendly. The food was good but not stand out amazing:

scotch eggs - the wife&apos;s favorite dish of the night. It was very good but just 1 egg. I feel like they should have given at least 2

mussels - top notch, always love mussels and they did it well

bone marrow - again another favorite, can&apos;t really go wrong with this dish and they did it well

burger - I got mine with egg (of course) and bacon.  Juicy with a good ratio of bread to meat it was moist and melt in your mouth delicious! Though I still have Au Cheval&apos;s burger as the best, this one is up there in the top 5!

brownie and ice cream - they tried too hard to make it different by adding some sort of curry spice. It did not work for me and pretty much hated this dish.

all in all a nice romantic evening with friendly staff and good dishes.  Come here for the atmosphere and try their burger!"
