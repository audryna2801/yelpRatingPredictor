5,"We ordered for pick up and had an AMAZING meal. My husband was craving a meat burger and I was craving a veggie burger...we both walked away very happy! He got the Rambler, I got the &quot;classic&quot; (but with a veggie burger patty), and we shared the salt &amp; pepper fries. The potato buns on the burger were so tasty and the patties themselves were delicious, flavorful, and very well-cooked. The veggie patty was a good mixture of veggies and grains and wasn&apos;t too salty. After popping the fries in the toaster oven for a minute, they crisped right back up--YUM. They were well-done (how we like them!) and properly seasoned.

We will absolutely order out from DMK again!"
4,"Their delivery took around 40 minutes which I consider pretty normal due to the distance. The order was not that warm but I heated it so that&apos;s ok. I really like Big Mac, it very much fulfilling."
4,"Pretty good meal! Ordered take out from Caviar and it was done ~40 minutes after ordering, although we were never given the alert that our food was ready. 

We ordered a shake, the #1 with double patties and the #2, both with substituted pretzel buns. Only mine ended up with a pretzel bun (a really great addition to the #2), which is a bummer for my boyfriend because it was a super tasty pretzel roll. I was a big fan of the #2 and thought it had a fun and unique flavor for a burger that I wasn&apos;t used to. The blue cheese and onion rings were really a great combination.

We also got the Wisconsin fries and the truffle parmesan fries with our meals. My boyfriend would give the fries (without the sauce) a 1/5 in terms of the overall fry quality, but I would give them a generous 4/5 after a quick run through the air fryer. They just seemed to be a little soggy. 

All in all a pretty good set of burgers! Maybe just a little pricey for what you get overall given the soggy fries and wrong bun substitution (still good but not really $17 good)."
2,"Overall food is good, second time coming here. First time ordered for pickup due to Covid...bison burger and sweet potato fries... everything was good other than the fact that they DID NOT put any cheese whatsoever on it. Sweet potato fries were good and for what the burger had, it was good so i figured I&apos;ll come back again before writing a review.


Fast foward 3 months - ordered a number 8, and number 7. The number 7(big dmk) was good, had everything on it and no complaints. The number 8(classic), good BUT missing cheese...again??? Cmon really? Even left a tip... honestly two times is enough for me to just not come back as there are hundreds of other burger spots in Chicago that have never messed my order up, not to mention twice lol. Whatever, put my own cheese on it at home and guzzled it down. I noticed there are other reviews that had the same problem, seems to be a common thing here.  Oh well, will take my business elsewhere."
5,"Their #5 (bison blueberry bbq sauce goat cheese) is my favorite and it&apos;s amazing. 

Paired with the Parmesan truffle fries is sooo good.

I order this at least once a month because it&apos;s so good!!!!"
4,"I enjoyed a bison burger patty melt (medium rare) with chive cheese fries and a chocolate shake this evening. Overall, this was a very clean and good tasting meal. My rye was a bit soggy from transport and the cheese sauce was a touch watered down. Order the fries extra crispy.  A tasty option in the hood. If you like chocolatey and super thick milkshakes, def order the chocolate one from here, too!  Nicely done guys. I&apos;ll be back."
5,"Love these burgers and fries and so do all my friends!! Can&apos;t go wrong with anything at DMK! The Mac and cheese was tasty too! The Milkshakes are boss! Always have some tasty beers in stock also! Never had a bad burger or fries! 

Pricey though!!"
3,"Located in the heart of DePaul/Lincoln Park, had to come out after having this place book marked for quite some time now. DMK is certainly known for its burgers. 

Parked on the street and walked about 3 blocks to get here - it&apos;s good to get your steps in, if you eat and drink as much as I do. I strive for 10,000 steps per day. 

Once in, there&apos;s a lotta cool signage and there was certainly a neighborhood crowd, gathering for lunch. The place is deep and the gentleman who spoke to us said, &quot;come over here&quot; as he motioned to a table in the back. He must of managed a parking garage at some point. How about a, &quot;Hello, welcome, I have a table for you right here, how are you today?&quot;

Despite this greeting, our server was very friendly and she explained the burgers and their special for that day - a steak tartar burger. We enjoyed the creamy coleslaw topped with scallions and my Rambler burger (shouldn&apos;t this be called the Blue Demon burger?) was excellent, as it came with crunchy bacon. A bit pricey for burgers but it was good to finally try DMK."
5,"I strolled on in by myself on a Thursday night around 7 pm and took a seat at the bar. There was plenty of seats as it seems most people were enjoying places with patios as the weather was beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised they had fancy sodas on the menu. They were out of the blood orange (the one I wanted) but the bartender recommended his favorite and the name escapes me but it was very light and crisp. I think these are seasonal or change as the were written on the menu board. 

I really just wanted a burger, so I ordered the number 8. It came with big slices of tomato and pickles. I was able to get a gluten free bun (toasted on the same grill as other buns so there might be cross contamination) they also had waffle buns and lettuce buns. 

I really really enjoyed my burger. I also ordered the sea salt and pepper fries. They were good...but pretty standard. 

Service was phenomenal! Overall, a great experience dining at DMK!"
5,"Didn&apos;t expect it but, DMK Burger Bar was simply extremely good. The location is unbeatable. The menu is really outstanding, many good choices, I had to go with Lamb Burger, and it was incredible. Team is extremely welcoming and definitely will help you with everything. It&apos;s definitely worth it!"
5,"Burgers are unreal, smoothies are unreal.

The male staff is a bit snobbish, but their burgers halo balance out the dbags."
5,"Love it! Chill atmosphere, great shakes, great buns and burger. The buns, seriously, so good! and amazing service. Can&apos;t wait for them to open back up!"
5,Tried this place for the first time through delivery and it was amazing! Can&apos;t go wrong with the bison burger! The buns on the burgers are really different than your average burger bun and it&apos;s super good. The meat is super juicy too! Highly recommend.
1,"Was looking forward to a great burger &amp; was very disappointed.  
While placing my online pickup order, I read that each burger comes with sea salt fries. Great! 
Not only were there no fries, but the burgers were raw. We tossed them in the garbage.
I called &amp; asked about the fries. I was told they&apos;re a la Carte. I reviewed the website, which clearly states all burgers come with sea salt fries and on average cost $15!!!
I called back &amp; was told, that the website needs to be updated. 
Well....either honor what your site says, or update it. 
I would Not recommend this place to anybody."
5,"Love these burgers and fries! 
Good place to friends meeting with some tasty beers.
Definitely come back."
4,"Good place. Burgers are solid, and the truffle fries are super legit. Bartenders usually friendly.

Try the DMK burger, it&apos;s huge but very good. Coming back to this place fairly often as it&apos;s one of the better place the get a burger in LP."
5,"Reeeally yummy veggie burger! The flavor of the pesto mayo comes through strong. My friend and I split the parmesan truffle cream fries, which were amazing and came with delicious dipping sauces that I also ate with the burger. We came around 8pm on a Saturday and got a table right away, and service was quick too. We were too full to order milkshakes but they have a peanut butter one that I still want to try!"
1,"We paid $80 for 3 sub par burgers and 2 milkshakes (they only delivered one). This is our daughters favorite place for some reason, but i told the family we will NEVER order from here again. This pathetic picture is supposed to be the grass fed bison and fresh goat cheese burger. Do they really think their customers are this dumb to tolerate such horrible food? Go ELSEWHERE!"
4,So sad that that they took the 2x4 off their menu!! The best burger... hopeful they&apos;ll bring it back. Consistently good and always has the best fries! Staff always attentive and helpful.
3,"DMK is another decent burger chain around the city, but I have to be honest-I do prefer frequenting other burger spots. 

I ordered The Rambler and added a fried egg on top. It had a generous amount of onions and mushrooms, cheese, and bacon. However, it is a very messy and greasy burger. It was pretty much falling apart as I attempted to eat it. Again, there&apos;s nothing wrong with that, but it&apos;s not my usual burger style. I also would have preferred the burger to have much less cheese on it (it was overpowering) and a bit less salt. 

I also tried an order of the Angry fries. Now these were quite delicious. They were cooked perfectly and had the right crispiness to them. The sriracha mayo sauce was perfect!-they had a small amount of kick to them and also a sweetness that I quite enjoyed. I also added crumbled bacon to the fries for a dollar and I thought it was worth the price. 

Service was fine-I have no complaints there. There is more than enough space in here for large groups and smaller parties. I just can&apos;t pretend that there are not better tasting burgers out there. I can&apos;t justify making a specific trip to come to DMK. Sometimes personal preference just rules over everything else."
