5,"Xoco is open for indoor dining as of 1/28/21, and was a delicious way to venture into the COVID-ridden world. 

SAFETY : (4/5) Our temperature was checked on our way in, and all the staff wore masks the entire time. The tables were spaced out, including the stool seats in the hallway. The hallway seats however, did not allow for people walking around to remain a comfortable distance away, as people were constantly walking inches behind us while we ate our foods with the masks off. 

SERVICE: (5/5) The servers were very friendly and courteous, and all the food and drinks came out SUPER fast. There WAS an error with our order (received the wrong item), but our attentive server fixed the issue right away and gave us the wrongly received item for free as an apology for the wait caused by the error. 

FOOD: 
- chips and salsa: (4.5/5) chips had strong corn flavor was were perfectly crunchy albeit cold. There were two kids of salsa (red and green) and both were delicious.
- short rib tlayuda: (5/5) The tlayuda was indeed gigantic as described in the menu, but every bite was packed with flavor. Even the broccolini tasted mindblowingly delicious not to mention the unbelievable flavorful short rib and the complex salsa macha. Side note: the tlayuda still tasted delicious as leftovers the next day, reheated in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!
- carnitas tacos: (5/5) Positively the best tacos in Chicago. perfectly balanced and constructed. We will never get carnitas tacos from anywhere else in Chicago again! 
- short rib tacos: (5/5) very flavorful, with a spicy salsa that packs a suprising amount of punch. It felt like a fusion taco, but was very delicious! will definitely order again. 
- churros with chocolate shot for dipping: (4.5/5) The churros felt just like the ones we used to get on the streets of Mexico, but for me personally, the chocolate was too empowering. I preferred the churros just by themselves."
5,"Hooray.  &apos;&apos;Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter&apos;s day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. &apos;&apos;Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, &quot;&apos;&apos;twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
5,"My love for XOCO will never die(Not anytime soon ..lol). I was hoping to get the weekend special on the Saturday that they used to have, guess they no longer have them anymore. Looks like they are offering indoor dine in as well. I&apos;ve ordered a to go, and it came out pretty quick. They have outside seating seating set up too. 
Ordered Pepito, as usual it tasted delicious, Crunchy and juicy as it should be. This is my second time being here, wait time was very bad back then(Before Pandemic) during lunch which is quiet expected. No complaints about the food though, tacos tasted great.

Highly recommended!"
5,"Absolutely delicious tacos and churros! Xoco is such a delicious lunch stop, and certainly filling. It is a little crowded during the lunch hours, but we were able to get seated quickly without a reservation. 

We also ordered the fully dressed guacamole, which was delicious and more than filling as an appetizer for 3 people. Really looking forward to coming back one day!"
4,"I came to Xoco last night with a friend and enjoyed it!  The place is cool, it feels like a hole in the wall taqueria, just upscaled a bit for River North.  When it&apos;s warmer, they have a few tables out front to sit at.

We got the Guacamole with all the fix-ins, Chorizo Tlayuda, Short Rib Taco, and Cubano Torta.  The taco and torta were recommended to us, and both were good.  I didn&apos;t think the taco was anything special, but really liked the smokiness to the torta.  The Tlayuda was huge, and super tasty.  I would have liked more chorizo because it was so good.  And the guac was terrific.  I loved all the fix ins on top.  Definitely recommend."
3,"Carnitas taco - very tasty. With one order I received four so it was very filling. 

Cubana Torta - had some smoked flavoring that was so overpowering that it went into the trash. It smelled like someone poured that liquid smoke you pour into a bbq grill to give it a Smokey flavor directly on the the food. It was so overpowering it was like eating a bottle of perfume, no thanks. 

Churros - very hearty for a dessert. Not hallow  inside so it was more like a little cake stick. It was still very good my guests loved it. 

Baja chicken Torta - Well seasoned and very tasty! 

I think this is a cool spot to try, but it&apos;s not a date place or a special treat I would give to out of town guests. Still... it was decent and I would definitely order again. Enjoy!"
5,"Amazing! Don&apos;t think I have a complete sweet tooth, but I promise, desserts here are better than anywhere else! I would recommend trying churros con chocolate and choco hazelnut cookies! 

Taste for a hundred stars! In addition, they look so appetizing that you just wouldn&apos;t be able to pass them by. I specially attach photos so that you could enjoy them visually and come here to taste them!"
4,A solid 4 star! This was a delivery order. I ordered the Baja chicken torta and my husband ordered the milanesa torta. Both were incredible! My husband says his is in the top 2 sandwiches he&apos;s ever had (tied with Nonna&apos;s chicken parm). We ordered the fully dressed guacamole to start. All 3 together was a LOT of food. My only complaint is that the guacamole didn&apos;t come with chips. I feel like if I&apos;m paying $12 for a side of guacamole I should definitely get chips.
3,"I&apos;ve been here two times, once today just for the &quot;Classic&quot; chocolate ($3.75), and once a while ago for food. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but the chocolate is pretty good. 

To be fair, food-wise I mis-ordered and got the Ahogada torta ($11), which came with a little puddle of soup at the bottom, and the two halves of the sandwich plunked into it like two sad, severed fish heads. I loathe squishy, soft foods that are originally not squishy or soft (e.g. crusty bread), so alas, this was a soggy 1-2 star sandwich for me. I also wasn&apos;t very impressed with the carnitas. The Fully Dressed guacamole ($9.5) was fine and a pretty big portion.

The &quot;classic&quot; chocolate, however, is quite good and has an interesting, strong chocolately flavor without being overly rich or thick. On the sugar spectrum, I&apos;d say it was right in the middle; could&apos;ve been less sweet, but I also can&apos;t accuse it of being overly sweet. It only comes steaming hot and in a small, ~6oz cup. I have a vague recollection of trying the &quot;authentic&quot; chocolate before and being unimpressed with its watery taste, but the &quot;classic&quot; one is definitely a solid addition to my ongoing Chicago hot chocolate crawl.

This restaurant is located right next to the section of Clark street that is closed Thursday-Sunday evenings (I think), so lots of nice outdoor dining available!"
4,"Come in with high expectations. Wasn&apos;t able to order the chilliquiles as I hoped but that was ok. I ordered the guac with quest fresco and tomato. Also comes with chips and two sides of their salsa. The red was slightly spicy the verde was amazing. This dish was great! I also ordered the spicy chicken churro sandwich. Even though it was kind of gimmicky it was pretty good. Well all know salt and sweet goes well together so this paired well. The pickled red onions and I believe shredded cabbage was also great. The spicy sauce on it was a bit spicy for me but I&apos;m weak. For the normal person it&apos;s probably just fine. If you prefer a little spicy either ask for it in the side or to go easy/light on it. Also ordered the pistachio churro which was delicious. 

And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.

5,"Love Xoco! This place is a must visit, especially if you forget (like I did) to make reservation at another Rick Bayless restaurant! 

Food: everything we ordered was amazing! We had the chicken Milanese sandwich, which was very good and really flavorful! The chicken tinga tacos were absolutely amazing, the chicken was so flavorful! We also got the glazed churros. I personally wish I got the plane churros but the glazed churros were amazing! 

Ambience: such a fun place to be! A lot of very good vibes 

Service: fast and good service!"
5,I know the food is good here but we actually had margaritas there which were made fresh and tasted great. Was the perfect drink before our dinner plans
4,"I like this place because it has good tortas, as do many of his restaurants. I suggest you not get their pozole, it&apos;s NOTHING close to a pozole and it&apos;s rather bland."
5,"I got the Shortrib Tacos and they were fire. The pictures don&apos;t do them justice.

They were spicy and super flavorful. They also sent a ton of salsa which was nice. Good value. 

I&apos;ll be back."
5,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Xoco to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. 

Most of the food arrived warm. The items we ordered that that traveled well:

- Pepito Torta: a little greasy, but amazingly delicious and packed with meat. The melted artisan jack cheese, black beans, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapenos all went so well together. It comes with salsa if you want to add some flavor, but it&apos;s not necessary as the sandwich is delicious on its own.

- Tortilla soup: very Rick Bayless item, the soup is so smokey and flavor is deep, not like any tortilla soup I&apos;ve had before. The garnishes come in a separate container, so you can portion and re-heat the soup without worrying about soggy tortilla strips.

- Carnitas tacos: hard to tell from the picture, but it comes with 4 tacos! They appear small upon arrival, but they are packed with meat and also come with fresh lime slices for squeezing. 

- Churros: obviously they&apos;re not going to be 100% fresh, but we popped them into the toaster oven to reheat for 5 minutes and they crisped up enough to feel almost freshly made. Add the home-made chocolate shot, it&apos;s so good for dipping!

Would NOT recommend the seasonal special &quot;Perfect Fall Tlayuda&quot;. It did NOT look like it&apos;s picture. Instead it was very dry and confusing. It&apos;s a wood-fired corn masa tostada with slow-cooked duck carnitas, maple-roasted butternut, kalettes, two cheeses (Jack &amp; añejo), salsa roja, black bean spread. The kalettes and butternut were very chewy (almost raw) and the whole thing was dark/ unappetizing looking due to the black bean spread."
4,"Was having dinner for the street from Xoco and the restaurant did not have dessert. We ran to Xoco to grab some churros before they closed. 

The churros are soooooo good! I can go without the dipping sauces and just plain churros! It&apos;s enough sweets for me and so worth it. Highly recommend the churros!"
5,"OMG that churro chicken sandwich will make you forget about chicken and waffles. Clearly Rick Bayless knows what he&apos;s doing. 
But keep in mind that once you eat it, you&apos;ll have to live most of your life knowing what you&apos;re missing out on. Beware."
5,"Five stars for desserts. We stopped by after dinner for churros and hot chocolates. We ordered the Authentic chocolate beverage, 3/$5 regular churros + chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio churros. The Authentic was very rich chocolate with strong fruity notes. I&apos;d advise you to finish your chocolate beverage before eating the dessert since the sweetness of the desserts overpower the beverage. The churros were simple yet delicious with the chocolate dipping sauce. One churro per person is a good portion.   I&apos;d definitely recommend the regular + chocolate dipping sauce. The pistachio was a too sweet and had a minty effect. I wouldn&apos;t order this again. I believe they use the same fryer for churros as any other fried savory item since I could taste a meaty aftertaste in the breading - but it didn&apos;t bother me in the long run."
5,"After loving a tres-leches cake I bought from there, I had to come back for a proper meal. Short rib tacos (missed the chance to get a picture because it was so tasty) were out of this world! The meat flavor was front and center and the sauce didn&apos;t detract from it at all. I also had the Jamaica (a hibiscus drink, I think?) but was the perfect compliment to this meal.

For dessert, we had the choco-flan which was basically a chocolate brownie/cake with flan on top. I wanted to love this but the cake tasted a little store-bought to me. The flan and chocolate sauce were amazing but the cake could&apos;ve been better. I&apos;m still giving the place 5 stars because of the amazing service/food/drinks combo.

Even with COVID, this place found a way to seat people outside and takes great measures to make sure everyone is safe. They check everyone&apos;s temperatures and all the staff are wearing gloves/masks."
5,"Delicious!!! This is a great place to visit if you want a more casual experience of yummy Chef Bayless fare. The food is tasty, hearty, and altogether comforting. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you want to pick up a little something for the soul!"
