5,"Great discovery! Was looking for some brunch spot and this place with raving reviews caught my attention. Mainly due to the menu, as you won&apos;t find traditional items here like eggs Benedict, Belgian waffles or Denver omelette, and that was exactly what I wanted. It has a rustic interior which is in the stark contrast with other breakfast venues around. But the main thing that makes this place so unique and busy is obviously its menu. 

I started with a cup of coffee and Mayan Benedict with two bean cakes, chorizo, avocado, poached eggs, sour cream and cheese. I also got their Blueberry Multigrain Pancakes, just because I couldn&apos;t leave this place without trying something else. Both meals were some of the best brunch items I ever had. Their Nitro coffee was also very good and strong.

The staff was nice and followed social distancing guidelines.
Their outside patio had decent size with rustic benches and umbrellas. 

Absolutely worth coming here again and again."
5,"I will give Bryn Mawr a rare 5/5! In all honesty, probably a 4.5 but i&apos;ll round up! It&apos;s been on my list for a long time so we finally made the trek north for the last good patio weekend of the year. They have a covered patio in the back with heaters, so they will likely be serving for a bit longer. FYI they do not allow dogs on their patio. I called ahead and they advised it was a 30 minute wait. When we arrived, it jumped up to an hour and we did wait the full hour. Upon being seated, we got water right away and the waiter came by a few mins later.

We ordered the Autumn Omelette, the Blueberry Mango French Toast (a cinnamon roll), a side of biscuits and gravy, and the pajun pancake. The pajun pancake platter was a 10/10. There were bacon brussel sprouts that were delicious! The actual pancake was tasty as well. The potatoes that come with the entrees are good - very unique. They almost have a thanksgiving stuffing flavor.

The Autumn Omelette was also a 10/10 for me. The bacon and butternut squash bits were delicious and it was super topping heavy. In fact, they had an entire half of an avocado inside which was interesting.  It came with a hefty portion of the same potatoes.

I was a little bummed because I was looking forward to the mango blueberry pancakes but it seems they were replaced with the pumpkin pancakes so I went for the mango blueberry french toast which is made out of a cinnamon roll. Very interesting concept, I would give it a 8/10. Beautiful presentation and a good chunk of mango on the plate but I didn&apos;t taste any mango in the actual dish (mango fanatic over here). I was hoping for a little more of the anglaise and a little less of the compote but thats just personal preference. If  I came back, I would probably try pancakes instead but still very good.

Finally, we ordered a side of the biscuits and gravy for $4.50 which was a good deal for two biscuits and gravy, compared to other local restaurants. The biscuits were soft and tasty but the gravy was off putting to me... It almost tasted like straight milk, which I don&apos;t like. My husband said it wasn&apos;t his favorite gravy either but he couldn&apos;t pin it. 

We agreed that our food was delicious overall and we would come back if in the neighborhood but wouldn&apos;t drive the distance to wait an hour again."
5,"Felt great being able to eat indoors in Chicago again, so of course we had to hit up one of our fav brunch spots, Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club. We had the Chorizo Skillet and Bread Pudding French Toast, which were AMAZING as always. If you haven&apos;t checked them out yet, you&apos;re missing out!"
4,"I&apos;ve been to BMBC a handful of times dating back to their original local on the corner of Kimball and Bryn Mawr.  Food and service there were always good, but sometimes there was a fairly long wait to get in.  

The new location just down the street seems a bit larger, and has not had the crowding it once had when we stopped in before COVID.  Food still just as good and they baked goods seemed to have stepped up their game as well.  (More options, higher quality, etc).  We love BMBC and look forward to be able to dine in again in the future!"
2,"Delicious food but service is just blunt rude ! Unbelievable. Rudely asked us to wear masks while inside
 younger guy  took the order nicely but after that we had to ask for things, they rudely refused the wifi connection details, and when I asked for salad to go just brought be the box. Don&apos;t think we&apos;ll be returning."
5,"Wow!  The food was fantastic.  It may look like it could be questionable... but the food was amazing!  A little spendy.  I&apos;d give it 2 1/2 $ signs.  But if you are on vacation or want a special treat, go for it."
4,"Somehow, I have never heard of this place and that is a shame because it just made my fave list. We rarely eat breakfast out anymore. I came across it via a quick search for a place to grab a bite while we had some time to kill. Heated patio available in back, reduced capacity seating available per whatever the current Chicago reg is. LOTS of signage regarding covid guidance. Friendly staff, cute rustic atmosphere, and a menu that requires some tough decision making because everything sounds wonderful. And it has scale to it as well, if you want to go bad, there are options on there that will send you on a sugar wave. If you want to be good and keep it healthy, they have you covered as well. The bloody&apos;s at $10 may seem steep but they are well made which is not always the case; and trust me, I can be a bloody snoot. I ordered the poached egg mayan bean cake special and my wife the French omelet. We enjoyed both very much and took about half of it home. There are SO many yummy sounding options on the menu that it practically begs you to come back and keep trying different ones. In terms of price, they are not giving it away, but you will not be disappointed either. There is a brunch offered on the weekend that will need to be investigated ;)"
5,This spot always has a line. So we thought we&apos;d give it a try on Valentine&apos;s Day for take out. Their menu is great and food awesome.
4,"There are meters to pay for parking in front of the restaurant. Came here on a Sunday for brunch. Ambience is decent. I came there with a group of people so we waited for about 20 minutes. 

Mimosa was fresh with a strawberry as a garnish. I had Raspberry hotcakes. Was really good but never got my syrup. Would be better with it. The traditional breakfast was great. The breakfast potatoes in particular were delicious. 

Overall a decent place to check out for brunch."
5,"honestly... one of my top brunch spots ever. when you come on the weekend, the wait time could be a lot but so worth it. I usually have the breakfast tortilla, but always get the french toast. to die for! I highly recommend this spot. I wouldn&apos;t recommend it to someone who is on a time crunch since they get so busy but hey, good for them! you guys are incredible!"
4,"Very cute little breakfast spot! The inside is very pretty and the stained glass windows are gorgeous. For COVID purposes, face masks are required when not eating and tables are nicely spaced and it didn&apos;t feel too crowded. We had the vegetable skillet, caprese omelette, and cinnamon pancakes and all were delicious. Portion sizes vary, and as you can see by pictures the skillets were massive but pancakes were a bit on the smaller size. I wish my skillet had some more flavor or the vegetables were seasoned better, but overall we really can&apos;t complain about the food or the atmosphere. Waiters were attentive and courteous while respecting space and distance. Also street parking is pretty easy in this area- but it is pay box so keep that in mind!"
5,"If you haven&apos;t been, you need to go. Absolutely one of the BEST breakfast spots in Chicago. You can&apos;t go wrong here. Good variety of breakfast and lunch on the menu. Weekend brunch. Specials. Fresh juice. Drinks, coffee bar. Everything is good but breakfast is better than lunch. Quality ingredients. Friendly and efficient staff. One of the best chilaquiles in the city. Seriously! If you love breakfast food, you need to get here. They have a very Covid friendly patio with good heaters. When it&apos;s warmer they have mesh netting that keeps out bees, flies which is nice. Parking is pretty easy on weekdays. Can be harder during peak hours on weekends. If it&apos;s busy, it&apos;s worth the wait!"
5,My cousin took me here the other day for breakfast and I tried their breakfast skillet. Then the next day I took my father. It was definitely 10/10!!!!
3,"So, two different experiences. The first visit was terrific, my friend and I hardly waited for a table (easy for a two-top) got served by the same person that sat us and it was quick and easy. The special that day was a wrap, but my friend was on some weird no carb kick or something and asked for no wrap and maybe just extra greens? &quot;Oh so like a salad? Yeah, we can do that.&quot; A &apos;special request&apos; like that can be irksome but she handled it in stride. I wanted to try their pajun and it came with toast and our server recommended the sourdough, that was made in house.

The deconstructed wrap looked great, and my pajun was good and filling and having the greens from the brussels helped me think I was eating healthier. The first visit couldn&apos;t have gone better.

Second visit was nowhere near as good. I got the chorizo skillet this time which was just ok but service was definitely not the best. It was slightly busier, with a slight wait for a table but nowhere near as overwhelming, the staff besides the runner who came by with water were just missing things, not friendly, didn&apos;t ask if we needed anything after we first got our food, even had to sit there to get our bill and then wait to sign our check. It was pretty disappointing."
5,"Have been coming to this spot for the last year since moving out to Albany Park. Love this place! Food is always on point, never had a bad dish yet. Have brought friends and family from out of town and they all say the same thing. This is the best &quot;_____&quot; I&apos;ve ever had. Drinks are great too. Best Brunch Spot Around!"
2,"Nice restaurant inside and out. Food wasn&apos;t that great and Adrian; our waiter had a bad attitude with us. He seemed pleasant with other customers but was very snappy with us. The only smile we even got from him was when he brought the check. Im a big tipper but not when im not treated right. 

Would not recommend or come back!"
4,"Tasty breakfast food! We came here after a run at Labagh woods. We were seated relatively quickly (We did arrive just at 10am. It got much busier when we finished our food). We ordered a plain two egg dish, Caribbean scramble, garden quiche, and a bread pudding French toast to share. The showstopper was the bread pudding French toast. The flavor was exactly like bread pudding with the spices and warm flavors. The scramble and quiche were good but next time we&apos;d most likely try a new thing on the menu. The Caribbean scramble had shrimp, avo, mango chutney, and some creamy cheese. It was good but could&apos;ve used more chutney and cream cheese! The garden quiche was on the healthier option which came with a side of salad that paired well with it. Will be back to indulge our sweet tooth. If anyone is to go, the bread pudding French toast is a much!"
5,"Went in early for breakfast and were seated right away. Coffee was great. French toast was amazing along with the red chilaquiles. Everything on the menu looked amazing. Though I don&apos;t do dine in very enough now, I&apos;ll definitely stop back in very soon. Side note, street parking was so easy."
5,"I love you. I love you. I love you. Literally, this is my favorite restaurant in all of time and space. I used to live &amp; die by the chorizo skillet, but I recently tried the tacos and they were absolutely incredible. Their coffee is amazing. Their food is amazing. Their staff is amazing. I get very happy any day we get to come eat here!!"
4,"This was a spot I had been meaning to try for a while. Parking was easy to find right in front of the restaurant (pay to park). There was no one available to greet us when me and the kiddos arrived. I asked for someone and they quickly had us seated. Server wasn&apos;t super attentive, she didn&apos;t refill our waters through the entire visit. Food came quickly and tasted great! I had the bread pudding French toast, the kids had the Oreo cake and Mini Cinnamon hot cake. I also ordered the daily special Black Bean Aztecs Bowl with chicken which wasn&apos;t super great. Overall not bad and I&apos;d come back if I was in the area."
