5,What views on such a clear night in February of this year! We were seated within ten minutes. Everyone was professional and it&apos;s definitely a high end restaurant. We had the herb shrimp for an appetizer and the lobster bisque and the seafood pasta for dinner. This is a high end restaurant but it was worth it for us for a special occasion. I&apos;d like to go again one day after it re-opens.
4,Great place I usually have a Long Island iced tea and the steak sandwich with the nachos.  The food is good and the view is terrific.  Unfortunately they are currently closed.  I hope they will reopen soon.
4,"The Signature Room is an incredible place to grab a drink and enjoy the view.   Yes, it&apos;s crowded at prime time, and yes, the drinks are expensive, but it&apos;s free to get into the bar, and you&apos;d pay for the same view if going to the observation deck.  At least you get to drink here!  

While it&apos;s challenging to get a table right on the glass, usually, if you are there for 60-90 minutes, someone will eventually leave and you can move. 

Highly recommended for a couple.  Let your kids go to the observation deck."
1,"These ignorant fools accepted a reservation for 2 on open table.  I arrived, paid 24 dollars to park.  Only to find out that they are closed.   This is totally unacceptable a year into COVID.  This is unmitigated stupidity and indolence.   It takes a certain amount of depravity to allow this to happen."
3,"The most practical and cheap option to see the panorama of the city relative to the Sky Deck and 360 Chicago will be The Signature Room lounge bar on the 95th floor of the John Hancock Center 875 N Michigan Ave. You can grab a cocktail from $14 or a beer from $10 and sit at a table with exactly the same view as a few floors below but a couple of bucks cheaper. You won&apos;t have to wait in line, either."
5,"The Signature Room at the 95th floor of the Hancock Tower is a perfect location for drinks, appetizers, and a beautiful view. On a beautiful day with a table seated right at the window, you cannot go wrong here! The prices are fairly high for appetizers like hummus and quesadillas; however, the view is well worth the price (and the food isn&apos;t half bad either)! 

Overall, the Signature Room was a great stop in Chicago to get a beautiful view of the city and to have a few appetizers before dinner."
4,"Prime spot for sunsets  in Chicago and I&apos;ve been here twice.

 Price: Lime-Mint Refresher $10. 

Tina&apos;s Tip: Minimum of one item per person for a table. Come right before sunset hour to get in line for the best seats near the window!"
5,"This is based on my reservation and visit to the Signature Room at the 95th (the restaurant)....not the Lounge at the 96th (the bar area which many of these reviews are for).

It was our anniversary and one of our favorite cities is Chicago. I wanted to make the evening special and knew about this restaurant but had never been there (did the tourist thing at the 360, however). I set up a reservation online, with the notes of that it was our anniversary, and I wanted a window seat overlooking the downtown area for the evening.

Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly and were wished a happy anniversary (nice touch!). They placed us at a table exactly where I had asked (even though I know they have a disclaimer saying they can&apos;t guarantee a window seat).  We were both really pleased of the view our table had, especially during the evening.

The service was excellent! They attended to our every need and obviously really cared about our experience and happiness. We both got a prime cut steak dinner and to say it was beyond succulent would be an understatement.  Was probably the best steak I&apos;ve ever had along with the mashed potatoes that we asked for.

We weren&apos;t there for the drinks, so never experienced the bar area above - we were there for a romantic evening and to feel pampered and the Signature Room staff and management delivered!

Throughout the meal they remembered why we there, and upon ordering a dessert to end the evening, they had a thoughtful touch added.  Thank you for a wonderful and memorable evening!"
4,"The views from The Signature Lounge on the 96th floor are unbeatable, especially if you are able to enjoy it on a day with good visibility. The atmosphere is relaxed and you truly get to enjoy the view over a couple of drinks and some light snacks, especially if you get a seat by the window. The first time I visited the lounge on a weekend, it was quite busy and there were hardly any open tables left - however, we were lucky to be able to sit by the window. Most recently, we visited on MLK Day, and so the lounge was emptier than usual. We were quickly seated near the window and our order was taken immediately. 

We spent a good couple of hours at the lounge, enjoying a couple of cocktails prior to our stellas. While the drinks were good, our order of the duck nachos without meat were rather bland, especially as the cheese had an odd flavor. Overall, the view and the experience are really what you pay for, as the drinks and food are quite expensive - thus, an appetizer and a couple of drinks each lead to a cheque of at least $100, much more than what I would anticipate to pay otherwise for the same food/drink."
4,"The view is spectacular, such a fun date night. Sea scallops were amazing, however the side of rice was not. I had some of my fianc√©&apos;s New York strip (medium) and it was easy to cut, juicy and tasty! 

Our servers assistant was on point... there every time we needed a refill, etc... however, our server was less than friendly and seemed annoyed to have to work. Bathrooms were dirty and outdated.

Overall, I still believe it deserves a 4/5 stars because of the proteins taste and view! Worth it!"
4,"What a brilliant business model idea. Let&apos;s open up a restaurant on the 95th floor in a city known for its high rises and gorgeous skylines. Yup, that definitely grabbed my attention. 

Here&apos;s the deal; if you just want to go for the views, I suggest heading up to the lounge on the 96th floor and grabbing a few drinks. Drinks are a tad overpriced, however, they have really good deals during happy hour (10$ for certain drinks) and you can catch the sunset (during the summer) while you&apos;re at it. Now if you are more interested in the perfect dinner or date, then the 95th floor is the place to be. I would highly recommend making reservations. This restaurant is not only popular among tourists but also enjoyed by many locals. Try to ask for window seating, but I know I wasn&apos;t able to snag a table the two times I&apos;ve been here for dinner. 

Service is great, but can be slow depending on the day and time you dine here. The menu is exactly what you&apos;d expect from a fancy restaurant. The casual steaks, duck and lobster, yet a few plates that might surprise you. The two times I&apos;ve been here, I&apos;ve had the Vegetable Parmesan Lasagna and the Half Roasted Chicken. My partner had the Roasted Salmon Fillet and he does not recommend it. The lasagne and the chicken on the other hand tasted great and definitely over priced. 

Great views, great menu and a definite good time!"
4,"As many reviews say, yes the drinks are expensive. But you&apos;re paying for the view. Wouldn&apos;t you rather go to the top for free and drink a beer for $10 vs. go up for $25 and not drink a beer? It&apos;s simple math.

Just look for the Cheesecake Factory Entrance, and go to the next set of doors. You can&apos;t miss it. It&apos;s really easy to find. 

It&apos;s not really all that nice of a bar. It&apos;s kind of like if a bowling alley lounge was transported to the 96th floor of a skyscraper. But there&apos;s nothing like having a drink and seeing that view. the signage where the elevators are.

Service was good, the waitress couldn&apos;t have been nicer."
3,"There&apos;s no doubt that you&apos;re in for an amazing view. Check the weather because it can get cloudy and visibility is lowered. If you&apos;re not seated by the window, there is an area to the left as you enter the bar only area (96th floor) where you can walk up to the window for a peek without disturbing other patrons. Also, there&apos;s a great view in the women&apos;s restroom as well lol. 

The drinks are expensive, but the one I had was quite tasty. I forget the name of it, but it was the one with Hennessy in it. I was there in December when it&apos;s pretty cold outside, but inside was a bit too warm for me. It can also get loud, but since you&apos;re seated at small tables it&apos;s not too big of an issue. The efficiency going up to the 96th floor was great. Note that there is a line to get seated when you get up there as well. 

I&apos;d definitely consider coming here for a drink or two to start a night or even as a casual catch-up session."
4,"While visiting Chicago, my friend and brother informed me about The Signature Room at The Hancock building as a great way to see a breathtaking view of the city, without having to pay for a tour. 

I have heard that lines to get into The Signature Room can get rather long, as a heads up, however our group of 4 pretty much got right up and in when we visited on a somewhat cloudy Saturday afternoon day. Despite the overcast sky, the view from the top was still incredible and the clouds were still far above the 95th floor. I am assuming the gray weather kept the lines shorter, but that worked out just fine! 

The drinks and food at the top were expensive, as expected. You&apos;re paying for the view after all. Still, paying $10 - $11 for a beer is still a bit cheaper than you would pay at a sporting event or some concerts. They even make a beer exclusive to The Signature Room (pictured below). 

Our group was lucky enough to be seated at a table in a corner, right along the glass windows. This allowed for great views in multiple directions. I did take note that some tables did not seem to have as a good a view though, so we were a bit fortunate. 

Overall, I would certainly recommend checking out this sky-high bar sometime. Just be prepared for the potential of long lines and not necessarily getting the view of your choice (though you&apos;ll get a good one to be sure!)"
5,It takes a while to be seated but it&apos;s absolutely worth it. One of my favorite places in the city.
5,"Lucky for me with out of town visitors or after work events - I have been here often - the reason I give it 5 stars is that you get to choose what to look at - this city girl prefers city building views all lit up at night while others want lake views, so every one is pleased!

Drinks are reasonably priced and there is a great variety of food to choose from whether you want to spend a lot or a little is up to you.  I had a few work lunches at the observation deck and this is the one I liked better."
1,My friend booked a place here about a month in advance for my birthday. We got what were probably the worst seats there. The view is breathtaking. Truly impeccable. Sadly that&apos;s the best thing about the place. We ordered seafood soup which tasted like it came out of a can. We got pasta and salmon for the main course. You know those moments where you throw up in your mouth and have to swallow it down for whatever reason...yeah this is exactly what the food tastes like. There aren&apos;t words for how truly disgusting the food was. I am not a picky eater nor do I care all that much especially when I&apos;m hungry but this was vile to say the least. I wouldn&apos;t get this food if I was starving. It tastes like frozen meals only worse if that&apos;s possible. The prices are also riding high for no reason other than the building it&apos;s in and the Chicago view. I suggest going for the view and that&apos;s about it.
2,"This review is for when I went back in Aug 2019:

This place has changed drastically. What used to be a gorgeous, old-school themed cocktail haven w/amazing views has become a tourist trap w/absolutely poor viewings. 

Drinks not worth their weight in cost. The drinks used to  be, but now they&apos;re doing mainstream concoctions (Long Island Iced Teas, martinis that are horrendous, faux daiquiris w/ too much cocktail mix &amp; no rum or lime whatsoever).

I was sooo disappointed.
Will definitely not be coming back.

Even Cheesecake Factory down the block has better cocktails &amp; that&apos;s pretty sad."
5,"Views,Views and more Views! It doesn&apos;t get better than the 95th &amp; 96th floor! Apparently, the women&apos;s restroom has an even better view but I completely forgot to check it out.

We didn&apos;t go to the restaurant itself, just the bar/lounge on 96. The drinks were amazing and the service was great. There is a line getting into the elevator but it moves pretty quickly. You should definitely add The Signature Room to your Chicago to do list."
5,"Hands down the best view I&apos;ve seen in my life. The clouds were perfectly coating the sky with various textures and the sunset was rather long. The ambience is excellent within the restaurant, setting the classy scene for a perfect date. 

There is a windowed bar area with small tables and a few booths. Then on the east side is great for larger groups enjoying a longer meal. 

This place has gotten busy over the  years so expect to wait in line for at least 20-30 minutes before you are seated."
