5,"Coming back to update this to the well-deserved 5 stars! I think every time I order from Toro (which is a lot due to the pandemic), it gets better! Really great appetizers and sushi, and extremely quick turn time for pickup. My favorites are the veggie gyoza, salmon crunch roll, Siberian Tiger roll, and So Fresh So Clean roll. Highly recommend!"
5,"I can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t reviewed Toro until now. Friday nights are sushi nights. We miss dining in right now, but so glad we are able to get takeout. Mitch and his staff are amazing and I appreciate them so much. We&apos;ve tried a lot of the menu, but our current usual order is OMG, Sunny, JJ, Three Musketeers."
5,"Best carry out sushi in Lincoln Park!  Great job Mitch.  We love the creative Maki rolls, and even offers a variety of veggie options"
5,My favorite sushi in chicago. The workers are soooo friendly and nice! The sushi is high quality and good portions. My favorite is the California crunch (no seafood) which has a delicious sauce that goes on top. All of my friends love this place too! Highly recommend for a great sushi spot.
4,"Despite living around the corner from here, I had never tried Toro until last Friday. Every time I walked by, this place was always packed, and it never seemed worth it to wait that long. But, now with dine-in being closed, it&apos;s easier to plan for a meal here, albeit take out only. 

There is a reason why this place is so popular. The menu is large, the food is good, and the prices are reasonable. 

I ordered the Crazy Horse maki roll and a bento box B (beef teriyaki and spicy tuna). The Crazy Horse had an interesting flavor to it - very citrusy but delicious - and I was very pleasantly surprised. Sometimes I feel like sushi starts to taste the same after awhile, but this roll was definitely different and refreshing. I really enjoyed it. The beef teriyaki was good too. The meat was high quality and even the rice was well made. The side salad was delicious. The spicy tuna was excellent. It actually had a kick to it, which was lovely. They were very generous with the ginger, which I definitely appreciate. 

My only complaints would be that they don&apos;t answer the phone. When I placed my order, the estimated time to pick up was over 70 minutes. I tried calling, just to confirm, and no one answered the phone. Of course, this place is crazy busy, but still, I feel like someone needs to answer the phone, especially in case an order is incorrect or something. When I arrived about 80 minutes later, my order was still not complete so the initial ETA was underestimated, which gives you a sense of how busy this place can get. Also, once you arrive, the queueing piece isn&apos;t well managed. You have all sorts of people crowding in the small dining area waiting for their food and it can be hard to keep track of who is coming and going. Still, it&apos;s a small price to pay for excellent food. I would recommend trying this place during the week day during an off hour. Try to avoid the dinner time rush. Otherwise, give it a shot. You won&apos;t be disappointed."
4,Really good sushi and such quick service! I came in on a Saturday around 6 pm and was seated right away. This was my second attempt coming on a Saturday because once the wait was 2 hours when I came around 8 pm so my advice is to go early as they do not take reservations!! The appetizers and sushi came out really quickly and I was in and out in under an hour. Very friendly staff and sushi chefs.
1,"Been to this place a couple times before. Food was always average. Family wanted sushi on Friday night and this was nearby. Big mistake!

First, they don&apos;t pick up the phone at all. Second, they make you stand in line when you go pick up your order. It&apos;s super disorganized. How do you know whose order came out already? Doesn&apos;t matter!! Wait in line until the people in front of you go in one by one to inquire about their order. If your order is not ready when you get to the counter, tough luck, go back to the end of the line and do it all over again!

Waited almost 30 mins after the time indicated on the order. There was a designated person at the pickup counter but did not even think to call out names for orders that are sitting on the table, while there is a line of people waiting outside. 

Lastly, we ordered 6 sushi rolls and a hand roll. Nothing was good. Everything was super small and tasted stale. Never coming back. Don&apos;t understand the high ratings."
5,This place is amazing!! I&apos;ve been to a lot of sushi places in Chicago and Toro&apos;s quality is comparable to those charging double. Recommend trying the eel!
5,"I was pleasantly surprised to find out they have a lunch special on Saturdays! (Bummed to learn there is not one of the weekdays, though). 
Anyway, I decided on Bento box &quot;c&quot; and it was a steal! For $10, the box was filled with salmon teriyaki, tempura veggies, a California roll, white rice, and salad. Plus soup as a precursor! The menu allowed a bit of variety for the bento box and it was all so tasty. I&apos;ll definitely be back!"
5,Rolls stand out here. The Red Dragon roll is mind-blowing in flavors. The Spider Temaki hand roll is another favorite. This is deliciously authentic with modern creativeness at its best. Miso soup is excellently packed while it&apos;s piping hot. The service is quick. We arrived home and the soup was still hot!
1,"This was a contender for the worst delivery of my life. 

The sushi was *disgusting* (read INEDIBLE since I was barely able to stomach one bite), the pictures did not represent the rolls, and the smell of fish was overwhelming as soon as the boxes were opened. Gross. 

The packing for delivery was subpar - everything was spaced so freely in large containers it was inevitable that it would be a mess by the time it was delivered (which it was). 

Overall, for spending so much on sushi, I would expect much more."
5,The best sushi I&apos;ve eaten in Chicago and the price is reasonable. I&apos;ll def come back to this place!
5,"It&apos;s been awhile since I&apos;ve reviewed a restaurant but Toro Sushi is definitely worth it! Stopped in here for a double date on a Saturday night and the service was hands down, amazing! Chef AJ was on point with the recommendations. It was our first time and he told us the popular items.. we trusted him and it was great! 

We ordered the kamikaze, oh my god, spicy tuna crunch &amp; red dragon rolls. We left satisfied and saved room for dessert at Molly&apos;s next door! Definitely WILL be back to this amazing establishment!! Wish I took more photos but I was hungry!"
4,"Arrived for a catch-up rendezvous with a Frenchy, in stormy weather. The place was packed.

Started with sashimi- 4
Rainbow rolls- 4
Spicy tuna- 4
Dragon- 4
Caterpillar- 4

Good sushi, service, and casual atmosphere."
1,"Decent sushi, but DO NOT order on a weekend. They accept WAY too many orders from multiple ordering platforms that they can&apos;t possibly fulfill them all and get super backed up. I waited over an hour for an order that I ended up abandoning (even though I had already paid for it). 

Their pickup system during COVID is also extremely inefficient and frankly hazardous from a health safety perspective. They say &quot;only one person in at a time&quot; on the door, which you would think is safe. But half the people picking up don&apos;t see the sign, and there&apos;s no rhyme or reason to it, so people whose food isn&apos;t ready will go in and wait there, preventing people whose food IS ready from going in and getting it. No one from the restaurant comes out and or calls out when orders are ready, so it&apos;s a total cluster with people having to go in and out multiple times to check. 

There&apos;s never a clear line outside, and because the restaurant is so backed up, you end up with all these people and delivery drivers just swarming around on the sidewalk by the door practically on top of each other. And on a very busy stretch of Clark Street to boot, so add pedestrians walking by to the mix. No thanks! Like I said, it&apos;s decent sushi for Lincoln Park and very convenient for where I live, but I will NEVER be ordering from them again."
5,"This is some of the best and most reasonably priced sushi I&apos;ve ever had! 

To start, the place is pretty small. There is definitely going to be a wait, if you go at peak hours. I came at 6:30 on a Wednesday and it was about half full. We were immediately seated, which was really nice.

Important note: BYOB!!

Looking at the menu, i was pleasantly surprised. There are so many options to choose from. There&apos;s classic rolls- which are under $10. Signature maki- which was about $11-$17. Then, there were some crazy rolls with things I never expected to have together. We tried the white tuna crunch and dragon roll. They were great! A little small but for the price I can&apos;t complain. Then we tried some signature rolls. We got the Arizona and the three amigos. The three amigos had guacamole with it, which I was a little uncertain about but it came out great! I&apos;d definitely recommend if you&apos;re looking for a fun spot to try some new rolls!"
4,"This restaurant is small, but very busy - that&apos;s a good sign. We had several rolls. Some roll we would recommend are:

Spicy Golden Roll - delicious
Miami - yummy

A great place for sushi. We can&apos;t get sushi in the burbs. Highly recommended."
5,"10$ saturday lunch special from noon-2pm for a bento box with plenty of goodies takes the cake (or should I say sushi). Ive been here twice now and both times the food was very consistently good and the service is decent. The seating area is small but there is takeout too (not sure if it works with lunch special). I eat the steak in the lettuce as a wrap, it has great sauce. The tekka (tuna) maki is great and the salmon sashimi is very fresh, great on the rice. Great sushi place."
5,"We walked into Toro on Friday at 6:15p-ish. We got lucky with a table (the last one) by the door and nabbed the only highchair. By 6:45p the place was pretty much full and there was a wait for seats.
All the sushi we ordered was amazing, our favorite was the Crazy Horse. It was so good that we didn&apos;t take pictures before digging in. The edamame was perfectly cooked and salted as well (which is not always the case at other sushi restaurants). We also got the veggie potstickers, deep fried, SO good.  
Service was great and it is BYOB! I highly reco this place, we will be going back."
3,Great sushi but ambiance and service leave much to be desired.  I&apos;d recommend ordering delivery or carryout but not worth the dine-in experience IMO.
