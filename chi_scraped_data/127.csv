5,"Seriously good food. The menu is short but that&apos;s part of the charm of this place. From ordering at the counter to takeout, the process was super quick.

We had a chicken shawarma, lamb shawarma, hummus &quot;side&quot; (it was huge!), and falafel appetizer. The lamb was seasoned perfectly and melted in your mouth. The chicken had a different seasoning than I&apos;m used to for shawarma. I loved it. My husband thought it was just ok. Falafel was perfect. Not too many spices, well balanced. It came on a salad bed with pickled veggies. And the hummus and pita was yummy. I wish I would have tried the lentil soup.

Cash only - so remember your wallet."
5,"Consistently delicious! This is a hidden gem in Andersonville, not Uptown! The City of Chicago updated the Andersonville boundaries years ago. 

I have been eating here for decades. The owners are lovely! Their food is always fresh and made to order. They are Cash only, even during this pandemic. 

My favorites are the lamb wrap, falafel and hummus wrap, chicken wrap, to die for lentil soup, and baklava. You cannot go wrong ordering one of everything! Their food is extremely affordable. If you&apos;re looking for yummy affordable food, this is your spot!!!"
5,"Delicious. We ordered to pickup and it worked out great!

We ordered chicken and beef shawarma, baba ganoush and Tabouli salad. Everything was tasty! They didn&apos;t have Baklava this time, I guess we&apos;ll have to go back there again!"
5,"Great spot!!! They never disappoint! 
They have small and yet simple, delicious menu. 
My wife had their falafel with hummus and she said it was tasteful and filling. I had both beef and falafel with &quot;Baba ghanouj&quot; and Yes!! They were awesome! 
Also, I got a coke and a crisp sprite to wash all down. 
Lastly, I had to try their good size baklava! I got two which they were almost gone by the way. 
It was the first time my wife had their dessert and she said it was one of the best ones she has tried. 
3 wraps, 2 drinks and 2 deserts for 18 dollars 
So worth it! The price was the part that blew me away. 


The only downside is that they only accept cash :/ but it&apos;s okay one can hope they will accept Bitcoin one day."
5,"Great, authentic Lebanese food for a price that can&apos;t be beat. The kafta wrap is fantastic. I recommend you add some of their chili sauce for some flavorful spice!

Just remember they only take cash! There&apos;s an ATM nearby if you need it"
5,Very delicious food! I love the fries here. They don&apos;t offer plates just sandwiches. Overall it was very tasty and will definitely go back again
5,"Only ever tried the chicken shawarma but it was delicious! Just the right amount of everything and the portion is huge. Plus, at only 4.30 you really can&apos;t go wrong. The menu is pretty limited but they have all the basics plus some French fries. Highly recommend for lunch!"
5,"Huge bang for your buck, tasty and generous. We need more places like this in Andersonville--not Mediterranean, we&apos;re good there, but family owned and what you see is what you get. The rents make it hard though. Taste of Lebanon 4-Evah!"
5,"Beef wrap, fries, baklava and a can of pop for less than $10.

Amazing value for delicious food.

Been coming a few times a month.

Consistently good with attentive service.

Nice guy behind the counter.

I like it here."
4,"VEGAN OPTIONS - Yes.

The falafels are crispy on the outside and very soft in the middle. Great tabouli! Super fresh veggies. Nice grape leaves. Warm and soft. Highly recommend this spot."
1,"We walked here from a nearby neighborhood and were at the door 10 min before 7 PM, this unknown customer suffered our fate as well. Doors were closed &amp; they had removed the hours sign. You should advertise your hours on your door, just as you do here on YELP, and then stick to them."
5,"Delicious, fast, affordable and friendly service. I&apos;ve had all the shawarma wraps and all of them are great. Salads are huge."
5,"What a hidden gem.  Just so fresh an deliciously spiced.  We ordered chicken salads (), grape leaves stuffed, Lamb kabob wrap- all very good. 
I am sorry to not have known how good (and reasonable) this place is long ago!"
5,Love this place. Best lentil soup ever. Consistency in all menu items. Favs #1 lamb kabob and today I got a free surprise of Bakalva.
5,"If you&apos;re looking for cheap eats and good falafel on the far north side this place is for you! Whenever I come in here with my gf we have a feast: each get falafel wraps with sides of grape leaves, tabouleh, and French fries. It all costs less than $20. The falafel comes with lettuce, tomato, tahini sauce, and you can also get it with hummus. The 6 piece grape leaves and tabouleh are always on point and the French fries are a nice add on when we&apos;re extra hungry (definitely just frozen fries they throw in the deep frier but sometimes that&apos;s all you want/need). We&apos;ve also tried the falafel plate/combo (not sure of the exact name, but it was also delicious).

Seriously this place rocks and everyone knows it. I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re not on your way there right now because all the tables are usually full with a line out of the door waiting to order. Cash only and make sure to throw your change in the tip jar because the guys behind the counter are doing God&apos;s work."
5,"Fast, cheap, delicious!
I order from Taste often! The owners are so nice and friendly. Try the Chicken Schwarma wrap or salad! DO NOT MISS the Lentil Soup!!!!"
5,Love this place!!! It&apos;s a little hidden gem! Everything is yummy - but they have the best falafel wraps and lentil soup ever!
5,"This spot has been a weekly stop for me for the past year or so and they have some of the best and most affordable Middle Eastern food you can get. The lamb wrap and lentil soup are both phenomenal. Make sure you get a side of their house made hot sauce. It&apos;s incredible and goes really well with the wraps and I even put some in my lentil soup as well. The owners are always super friendly and have even snuck in a free piece of baklava every now and then, which is much appreciated."
1,"I had an order of two shawarma sandwiches, plate of mix veggie and two lentil soup none of those orders was taste like a Middle East or Labanaise. After I ate some of the food I got stomach upset. I don&apos;t like that food at all. They are also not clean."
5,"The lentil soup is really good. The prices and portions here are awesome - enough to offset the hassle of it being cash only.

$3 for a decent bowl of lentil soup and a bunch of pita - it&apos;s decently sized filling warm snack, perfect for a cold day. I&apos;m not really a fan of straight up lentil soup but the spices are great and it&apos;s packed with flavor. Even as a meat eater, I&apos;d definitely come back just for the soup"
