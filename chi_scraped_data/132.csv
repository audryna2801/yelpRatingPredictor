5,"When I was in Chicago for a conference, pre COVID-19, I couldn&apos;t resist taking a trip to the Field museum after the conference was over. I&apos;m so glad I did. As soon as you step inside there is the skeleton of a giant Titanosaur, which gives the museum that immediate wow factor. It is a bit of a downer when you read that none of the bones are real, but there is also a display next to it of real Titanosaur bones so you can see that the dinosaur had to really be that big. My favorite things to see at a museum are dinosaur bones &amp; Egyptian artifacts. The field museum has plenty of awesome displays of both. The big prize is the display of the T.rex named Sue, the largest and most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton ever found.

What I really love about the Field museum is how everything is organized. The exhibits basically chronicle life on earth from the very beginning. So as you walk through the exhibits it&apos;s like you are walking through time. The skeleton of Lucy, one of the earliest hominids is another prize of the museum.

If you are in Chicago the Field Museum is a can&apos;t miss attraction."
5,"Today was our first visit to the Field Museum. We were apprehensive that it wouldn&apos;t be as nice during covid times with all the restrictions, but boy am I glad we went! We saw many breathtaking things, from real mummies and ancient Egyptian artifacts, actual skeletal remains of dinosaurs, fossils that are hundreds of millions of years old, and so much more! There was very minimal visitors at the time that we were there, and it was very easy to socially distance. Masks were required, and hand sanitizer automatic dispensers were everywhere for your convenience. Although the cafe was closed, we did get to check out the gift shop, which offered lots of goodies for people of all ages. The staff were very friendly and helpful, there was no wait for anything at the ticket counter, and parking was plentiful at nearby parking garages within a very short walking distance. We absolutely had a blast, and my toddler loved seeing all of the animal and dinosaur displays. I highly recommend this museum to anyone looking for fun and educational things to do in the Windy City. You will not regret it! We definitely plan to come back in the future! Thank you, Field Museum staff, for a wonderful trip!"
5,"I love this museum! I think it is a definite must-visit for Chicago because of its size and the variety of exhibitions. A few of the many permanent exhibits include (stuffed) animals from different regions of the globe, Egyptian mummies, and dinosaurs! 

Sue the T-REX is on display here and she is known around the world as the largest, most extensive, and best preserved T-REX skeleton ever found - her section of the dinosaur exhibit is beautiful and very informative. 

I would say that most of the exhibits at this museum are very well put together and you can tell that the Field museum values quality over anything else. Prepare to set aside around 2-3 hours to see everything, we only had an hour to spare and definitely felt rushed."
4,"Fields museum is a famous and massive Museum located in downtown Chicago right on the river right near the aquarium and solider field. 

I&apos;ve visited this place a few times over the years and it is massive. So much history and information to take in. I feel like we miss things every time we go. 

A favorite  of both me and the kids is the giant T. rex bone sculpture. Before making my first visit to fields museum I had never seen an actual dinosaur bone sculpture. Just in shows and movies like Jurassic park.  So that was really cool to take in and see in person. 

Very cool and historic site. Worth checking Khrushchev if you are a history buff or have young kids who like museums."
5,"A MUST visit!! An absolute Chicago staple for tourist and residents. Make sure to check if you are a resident as there are days with free admissions (especially for students). There are special exhibits that you will need tickets for, usually worth it. 

Sue the Dinosaur is a must!"
5,"This museum impressed my friends and me. We were surprised by how big it was and the number of exhibits. We began our way around and were fascinated by the detail in the displays and depth of information. We were planning on only spending 1-2 hours to kill time, but ended up spending half a day here!! We got lost in the exhibits and loved it. Definitely recommend!"
5,"Another spot I have visited a lot. When I was young and adult.
This is another place that is great to experience if you come to Chicago.
So much to see and so much history."
5,"A really cool, underrated museum you should really make time to see. It&apos;s all about science and natural history you can&apos;t find anywhere else. We ran short on time and that was a big mistake because it&apos;s pretty amazing inside. The field museum is part of the City Pass if you decide to get that. I fully recommend it. 

They have actual dinosaurs and mummies... need I say more? Not just a few... they have so many different sizes and varieties. There is a lot of other stuff to see. You could spend an entire day here. Great way to spend a rainy day as a local or stop by while on vacation and get a picture with Sue the T-Rex.  They have the worlds largest Tyrannosaurus Rex. Overall very cool visit and I highly suggest."
5,"What more is there to say about Chicago&apos;s most historic (and arguably most famous) museum that hasn&apos;t already been said!? We&apos;ll I guess there&apos;s a lot actually since this place is HUGE, exhibits are always changing, and it&apos;s a Chicago staple that never gets old! 

Took advantage of the fact that the museum was free for Chicago residents for the month of February, and enjoyed being a tourist in my own city for a day! Only downside is that the place was PACKED! But we kinda expected this, I mean it was a holiday (President&apos;s Day) AND it&apos;s free. Everyone and their mother and brother was there, but that didn&apos;t stop us from having a nice time. 

A few of my favorite exhibits include the Evolution Exhibit (including SUE), Ancient Egypt, and the Gems &amp; Stones room. Their rotating exhibits are always well curated and interesting as well. The evolution exhibit (although been there forever) is always cool to me! Taking you through the multiple mass extinctions that have occurred on earth, including the ice age and prehistoric periods. And of course SUE, the almost complete recreation of a trex with real fossiles! A must see. The Field is a must for those visiting and/or us residents who haven&apos;t been in awhile. It&apos;s always a good time! The Field also doubles as a large venue space for super cool events, which is another reason this place rocks! Pretty sure entrance fee is pricey, so do your research and try to find a free museum day."
4,"I love museums!! The Field Museum has clearly been around for some time, but there are touches that show they are regularly updating and innovating their displays. 

I got to meet Sue, the famous T-rex. I thought this was the most impressive experience with dinosaurs I&apos;ve had. Not only is Sue there, there are so many more fossils that have been preserved and displayed. I was so amazed. I think if little me from the past saw this exhibit, I would have wanted to be an aspiring paleontologist! This is an incredible experience that you would not want to miss.

They also have some great displays from places around the world. This place is absolutely huge. I could hang out here for hours - days even! Very much worth the trip to downtown Chicago. I&apos;d love to come again."
5,"One of my favorite museums in the city! Their exhibits change so I&apos;m basing this off their permanent and mentioning a couple that are traveling.

First off some permanent ones...

Some really cool new additions is the brewseum. Hidden past Africa and the expansive wildlife creatures. You can get lost easily in that.

The Sue exhibit is pretty cool and great for kids because of how interactive it is especially smelling what a t-rex&apos;s breath would smell like. Prepare yourself for that smell.

Some of the other permanent exhibits I like to check out but I&apos;ve seen a lot since my childhood field trips - Ancient Egypt, Underground Adventure and the gem room.

Now for a couple of the ones that will end soon...
The Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit was super cool and very large. I learned SOOO much. You can&apos;t take pictures of it to respect the photographers. Some of the best shots are in the gift shop for purchase in postcards or book form along with some Polaroid merch (because of course you are 

The Fantastic Bug Exhibit was super good! Interactive and colorful. It wasn&apos;t boring or gross. The larger than life creature hubs and displays were great! There are also times listed for live bug encounters. They framed this exhibit well, I was never saying that&apos;s gross but saying that&apos;s pretty or cool.

Now onto the food...
This is the first time we ate lunch at the museum. You can bring your own but we wanted warm food and not to carry our lunch. The Field Bistro is upstairs and offers fancier fair like curries and more upscale burgers. It&apos;s cafeteria style. We opted for the Explorer Cafe downstairs which has your basic run of the mill burgers, fries, personal pizzas.

Another thing I thought was really cool is that the Field Museum has two beers - Tooth and Claw and Pseudo Sue along with their own rye, vodka and gin. All sold in the gift shop but you can buy the beers from both eateries. 

I had a very good time this day. My boyfriend received a year membership to the Field Museum so we&apos;ll be back when a new exhibit hits it. Next time we&apos;ll try to check out the Field Bistro."
4,"The only downside to this super cool natural history museum is the other patrons- seriously, at times there were so many people we couldn&apos;t walk, and half of the other patrons are children too young to understand anything throwing a tantrum with parent forcing them to keep going, or parents with children who are actually a nice time screaming at their kids for no reason- I watched a mother literally tear her child away from watching an archeological demonstration to scream in her face &quot;this is a tar pit&quot; while shoving her under a railing to make her touch the do-not-touch display. 

The gem stone and mineral displays were very well organized, the Tyrannosaurus Rex was awesome, and they have hours worth of animal evolution displays.

Definitely a must see- the parking is pricey, so I&apos;d make a day of it in nice weather!! I would also say to go at a non busy time- although I went on a weekday midday, so I would hate to see what their busy time is like"
4,"Nice place to visit with family. Maybe more suitable for older kids. Price not bad for all there is to see. They need to update their videos, lol"
5,"They moved Sue the T Rex upstairs because the temperature changes from the doors opening and closing in the mail hall were decaying the bones.

Always new exhibits probably the 3rd or 4th time I have been and it never disappoints.  Good to donate to charity and a great cause!"
4,"Some of my earliest and fondest memories as a child are of my family traipsing through the museums located within Chicago&apos;s Museum Campus. With 57 acres of museums sitting right next to Lake Michigan, it always brings back a flood of memories. My easy favorite of the three is the Field Museum. 

Traipsing through the wings is still a favorite way to spend a Sat afternoon. Just like I did when I was barely out of diapers. Ancient Egypt has never stopped being a favorite of mine and this place always delivers. It&apos;s the exhibit I always go to first. 

Although not cheap with its entry fee and Soldier Field parking, it still keeps bringing me back for more. The cafe leaves much to be desired though. The food even less inspiring than you can possibly imagine and two basic meals and drinks costing $50+. Yikes. 

My trip last weekend was just a few days before pandemonium from COVID-19 hit. Rubbing elbows with a sea of people. Pray for me my friends. Lol"
5,"This museum rivals what you would find at the Smithsonian museums in DC. And everything is packed into an impressive layout. The T Rex, Sue, is the crown gem of exhibits here. 

It honestly is a bit overwhelming how much is here. You can easily spend all day here and not see all the exhibits. I spent so much time just looking at meteorites and gems that I basically ran through all of the wild animals and birds. 

My wife and I got a City Pass which gets you access to the museums clustered in this area. Highly recommend as it includes tickets to the movies they play inside."
5,"Certainly one of the most interesting attractions in Chicago, the Field Museum hosts exhibits on topics from dinosaurs to minerals. Shortly before my first visit, the new Sue exhibit was opened to the public. This was what I was looking forward to the most, as I am not an Illinois native and I have known about the fossil since I was a child. All new sensory experiences are also offered within this exhibit, such as a chance to smell what plants that existed during Sue&apos;s lifetime may have smelled like in addition to the opportunity to get a whiff of what scientists believe her breath would smell like. I took this opportunity and while I don&apos;t regret it, the smell isn&apos;t pleasant because it is that of rotting flesh. All the scent stations clearly indicate what smell is contained within them, so don&apos;t worry about accidentally sniffing rotting dino meat.

Expect to spend a solid portion of the day here, as there is a lot to see."
5,Very cool place... like an awesome Natural History Museum
5,"Wow! There is so much to see here! I didn&apos;t realize just how large the museum is. It probably took us close to 4 hours to go through everything, so definitely wear comfy shoes. 

We started downstairs with all the animals. There are tons of stuffed animals showing many species. The birds were especially impressive because of how many variations there. But I really liked seeing some of the larger animals like the lions. 

We also checked out the mummy exhibit, the ancient americas, dinosaurs and more! We didn&apos;t purchase access to any of the extra exhibits but honestly I don&apos;t think we would have even had the time or energy to explore them. 

Overall I was very impressed with the amount to see and it definitely made me feel more like I got my monies worth."
5,"Make sure to get the all access pass as you will need it for access to several excellent exhibits.

Adults... don&apos;t miss the China exhibit!  I could have spent the day there!"
