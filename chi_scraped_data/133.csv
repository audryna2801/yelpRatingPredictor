5,"Yooo this place is seriously the bomb. I&apos;m drooling writing the review the morning after and am also in a depression state knowing there are no leftovers in the fridge. Guess I&apos;ll just need to go back, because holy moly this is the real deal. 

We honestly stumbled upon this place because everything seemed to be already full at capacity (during COVID-19) where we stopped at and were walking to our next potential place to try and dine in at, but saw this one on our way. It was literally 10 degrees outside and by no means did we want to walk any further so it was already a good idea to stop here and try it. I had it bookmarked since moving here so why not?! 

The staff was very friendly and the food was just next level. Ordered a plate of wings with buffalo sauce and that shit was fireeee. we also ordered 2 cocktails (both pretty strong - and perfect), and Combo A which satisfied the two of us sharing those items. Our other friend got a separate build your own mussel plate as well as a margarita and waffle fries. 

We were SO happy to end up here though. For real, the fact that they had alchy and it was a casual dining experience made everything better all while having fire ass food. We WILL be back considering we live in the neighborhood and I&apos;m always wanting a NOLA - Cajun type fix.... mmmm I may just order again today."
5,"Walking down Clark looking for a a good dinner spot and you could smell the garlic from the sidewalk. We found a seat at the bar. Our bartender was outstanding. Very engaging and friendly. He was happy to help with a tour of the menu and suggestions as we had neither been to place. I had a margarita which was very sweet. Good as a starter. We tried the fried shrimp, cornbread, and a shrimp boil. The cornbread is awesome slathered in honey butter with evident pieces of jalapeño. The shrimp is served with a Cajun type dipping sauce with a little heat. The shrimp boil in lemon pepper sauce was delicious. Tons of pepper for spice and garlic. I ordered the hot temperature and it has a good heat level. The red potatoes and broccoli were cooked perfectly. This is a big portion. Perfect for sharing. We will definitely return to this or other locations."
5,"Love Lowcountry! It&apos;s a good seafood boil. Great covid care and contactless pickup.

I always get shrimp and sausage and corn and cornbread. Can&apos;t go wrong here. I love spicy but usually the group I have went with (or picked up during covid times) usually prefers less heat. A 1 and 2 is not too hot and you can even do a mix of those for a 1.5 level. If your group likes spice, definitely do a 3 or 4. 

The Oreos and beignet are great desserts. 

Love this place. Good service!"
5,"Buckets full of shrimp, crab, potatoes, corn, sausage and garlic butter? 

F Yeah!!! 

I love this place! Warning: you will burp garlic for a week but it is sooooo worth it."
5,"Everyone deserves a seafood boil. 

I suggest no matter your preference for crab or shrimp; you get both. Add in Sausage and broccoli (in addition to the corn and potatoes) and you have a winner. The cornbread is addicting. 

Finger-licking good."
3,"This is a post Covid review:

I&apos;m a bit torn writing this review, but decided to proceed in case it helps anyone avoid a dangerous situation.

Pre-Covid: 5 stars.

Post Covid: 5 stars on food, ZERO STARS on Covid stuff.

I tried to order a custom boil  to pick up through their online system during the last week of September on a weeknight, it was down, so I called and no one picked up. I ended up driving over and ordering in store.

The staff were super kind and useful, however I was horrified to see that the place was fairly crowded and several customers were freely moving throughout the space (Washing hands, visiting other tables, going to the restroom) without masks and with no social distancing. The air circulation was not great (it was pretty warm and muggy) so it especially felt incredibly unsafe. I immediately complained to the server who took my order at the register. It sounded like they do ask folks to wear masks when not at their tables but people don&apos;t listen and there was nothing they could do about it. I completely empathized with the server, as so many people react aggressively when asked to wear masks so I imagine trying to enforce that it may feel unsafe to the server team.

I haven&apos;t realized the situation inside until I started placing my order at the register at the back of the restaurant. Had I known, we probably would have skipped-- my husband and I have been quarantined since March so this is the only situation I&apos;ve been in where I could have potentially contracted with the virus--it completely freaked me out. 

I wasn&apos;t comfortable waiting inside for my order to be prepared,  because of the people without masks, so the server kindly agreed to bring the order out to my car. The food was great, absolutely no complaints there but I will not be back for a pick up order while we are still dealing with an airborne pandemic.

While I hope, for everyone&apos;s safety, the restaurant figures out an enforcement system regarding customers moving throughout the space unmasked, If you&apos;re in a high risk group for a severe reaction to COVID-19, this might not be the best place for you right now."
5,"Delicious food and wish I could dine in here because the entire farmhouse style/aesthetic is everything! My boyfriend and I ordered fried chicken and waffle fries for our appetizers. The fried chicken had a unique sauce which reminded me of a chili Thai flavor and was super delicious. The waffle fries were also amazingly crispy and went well with the white dipping sauce (I wish I knew the name of that sauce)! We also got the seafood boil that consisted of 1/2 lb of shrimp and snow crab legs with potatoes, corn, and some cornbread on the side. All of it was so delicious and was enough for both of us to eat with little to have for leftovers. I paid about $50 and would love to come back for sure and dine in when it&apos;s opened again!"
5,"Came here to try the seafood boil. Want to say Raymond at the bar is amazing, if you can get him to be your server do it! He knows his stuff. He explain the menu to us answered all our questions. It&apos;s been pretty hard for me to change my mind since Angry Crab being a horrible experience with seafood boil in Chicago. Got the Lobster Combo Special with garlic and just the regular heat. It was delicious! Will come here again and will recommend this place to anyone."
5,"Lowcountry is one of the best kept secrets of Chicago. They have some of the best seafood boil around. I would bathe in a pool of their Everything sauce. It&apos;s definitely a no frills kind of place and you get messy, but that&apos;s part of the fun! Such good shrimp and crab legs. An underrated favorite: their pickeled vegetables. The order comes with a huge amount of food, so be ready to be eating for days!"
5,"We celebrated my cousin&apos;s birthday (before the shelter-in-place order) and got takeout from here. 

There was some mishap with ordering at first. I tried to fill out the online order but it wouldn&apos;t submit the page. I called and the guy said that I can&apos;t order delivery over the phone nor can I order takeout over the phone, that it all had to be done online. I was frustrated so I had my friend call back 2 min later. When she called, he said it&apos;s fine to order takeout over the phone. ???

That aside, there was about 8 people at this celebration. They got down everything right and it was wrapped up securely, which is hard for something this big and saucy! I was impressed. 

Most of us ordered the Fill Your Own Bag where you can pick your seafood, sauce, spice, and sides. I got shrimp head on, garlic, weak sauce, with a side of potatoes and jalapeño cornbread. It was amazing and SO filling. I did have a little left over and that was still good the day after. My cousins and friends all liked their food too. They said the calamari was okay and the garlic noodles could&apos;ve had more garlic, but the lobster Mac and cheese was really good. I&apos;ll have to try those next time. 

We had a big ole feast and enjoyed every part of it! And thanks for the bibs too!"
4,"As far as seafood boils go, Lowcountry is pretty standard, but it&apos;s also delicious! 

There are some combos on the menu with set prices, but you can also build your own bag. If you build your own, the seafood  is by the pound and sold at market price. You then choose your sauce, spiciness level, and veggie add ins. We did king crab legs ($$$) with spicy Cajun sauce and shrimp with spicy garlic butter sauce. The sauces were both good, but if I went back I&apos;d go for the garlic butter, as the Cajun was a little too salty. Just be ready to have serious garlic breath! The seafood was cooked perfectly, and there was more than enough sauce to go around. We also got some jalapeño corn bread- I thought it was decent, but no where near the best cornbread I&apos;ve had. 

They don&apos;t accept reservations, and expect to wait at least 30-40 minutes for a table during peak times on weekends."
5,My friend and I dined at the bar after being greeted by very accommodating hostess We were fortunate to have a fabulous bartender who took extremely good care of us answered all our questions and provided one of the best meals I&apos;ve had in a long time. Kudos and credit to the entire staff We will be going back thank you for all you do.
5,"Oh my goodness! This place is seriously amazing, I found them on tiktok and the food looked so good that I just had to try it and let me tell you they did NOT disappoint.  Perfect amount of spices and they are generous with the garlic. I ordered the hot and it was perfect! This has definitely become my favorite crab spot! Customer service was also great they called to conform and called again to let me know it was ready! 5 stars all around!"
5,"What an amazing adventure I had ordering from Lowcountry in Lakeview. The service was awesome. Placing my order over the phone was pleasant. I wished I knew the person&apos;s name that was taking orders, but he was so darn cool and funny. 

Also, my order was ready when I walked in, and I was given the option to purchase a cracker for $2. I thought that was a reasonable price for such a heavy duty cracker. 

Also, my food was neatly packaged. My drive home was long, and I was worried that my food would be cold, and tasteless, but it was not. The bags are durable, and it keeps the steam in, and the food warm and fresh. 

I ordered the combo D- Double Double combo for two persons. This order came with headless shrimp, two clusters of crab legs, potatoes, corn, and jalapeño cornbread for $61. I know, I know...spending that much money  on take out during a pandemic is ridiculous. However the food was amazing and the price is justifiable. 

I ordered my boil with the &quot;everythang&quot; flavor (mixture of all the flavors they have on the menu). My crab legs and shrimp were so juicy and flavorful. The potatoes were nice and tender, and my corn on the cob was overcooked. The jalapeño cornbread was finger licking good. 

I felt like I was eating inside of the restaurant, and I was happy to make the decision and treat myself to some seafood. I didn&apos;t know about the amazing customer service, which was a bonus. 

Otherwise, I plan to visit this location more frequently for my seafood boil cravings. I don&apos;t eat seafood often, but the customer service alone is worth the visit."
4,"Seafood, garlic, butter, cajun, breads, rice... what&apos;s there not to like? 

This spot is a little splash of Nola in the middle of Chicago. Having visited, I actually prefer Chicago&apos;s Lowcountry. It&apos;s just so much damn saucier. Louisiana doesn&apos;t make their cajun boil as wet. Pair the rice with the sauce, and you&apos;ll know exactly what I mean. Bomb!

It&apos;s a few dollars pricier than most other cajun places I&apos;ve dined at. Mad boiler is comparable and has a cheaper price point. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I relish this spot, but I also get a high off digging around the city for best prices. 

There&apos;s definitely a few more cajun, NoLa-influenced spots I&apos;d like to taste before returning. I&apos;ll have to try the garlic beignets and corn bread the next time I come back. The garlic noodles is an inexpensive pairing here, but just skip it. Try the breads instead. 

Whoever decided to install sinks in the middle of the restaurant, pat on the freaking back for you. They&apos;re so convenient!"
5,"Great service and drinks sitting at the bar last night. 

They are handling social distancing well, and the food is still awesome. 

This meal set a new bar for pandemic dining experiences in Chicago."
5,"Love the seafood from here. Everything is so incredibly fresh and the sauce/seasoning they use is wonderful. It is like an explosion of savory and salty flavors in your mouth. The cornbread is also great, moist with a perfect chewy texture and great taste. The amount of food they give you is also very generous and we had a lot of leftovers. Highly recommend!"
5,"Can&apos;t say enough good things about this place. Seafood is AMAZING &amp; so fresh. Service is really great, always, whether it&apos;s pickup or dine in. BEST PLACE TO GET CRAB TO GO DURING COVID-everything comes double bagged and wrapped in foil, food stays super hot &amp; delicious. If you&apos;re dining in, beware of the pina coladas because they are so delicious and addicting &amp; will sneak up on you!"
1,"I ordered for take out, and received notice that my food would be ready around 6:45pm. I arrived at 7:00, was told it would be ready in 20 minutes, and that I would receive a phone call to notify me. 40 minutes later I went back inside to check the status a second time. When I asked how long it would be I was told &quot;I don&apos;t know, we&apos;ll call you when it&apos;s ready.&quot; It&apos;s now 8:42pm, three hours after I placed my order, and I never received a phone call. I ended up leaving and going home. Absolutely terrible customer service, would not recommend."
5,"A friend brought me here and I genuinely did not look up the menu or anything beforehand. It is such a cute place with very kind staff. I ordered what my friend suggested, shrimp in a bag with Cajun seasoning and potatoes and corn. I had no idea what to expect and I was absolutely blown away. When they bring you the bag it&apos;s such a strange moment, but then they cut it open in front of you and your food is just like a platter of deliciousness. I loved what I had. I have some leftovers and I&apos;m so excited to eat them. I highly recommend coming here. I am definitely going to return to try something else on the menu. Everything about this place is so much fun. From the decor to the music, this place is an amazing night out. Thanks for such a fun night out!"
