5,"Since we are finally able to sit inside of a restaurant... again, I thought I&apos;d take full advantage of it.   The restaurant is certainly following Covid guidelines set by the state.  

Upon entering this large restaurant, I was greeted and seated right away.  Angel, server, was taking care of other tables before he greeted me.  Plus, it gave me enough time to review the menus.    I decided to order off of the Lunch Combo menu.... Caesar Salad and the personal size pizza.    The interior  is very relaxing with a large bar and tables were spaced apart.  

Within 10 minutes, Angel had delivered my meal.  For lunch, the portions were just right.  Can&apos;t say anything negative about the meal.  Angel did check in with me couple of times.     Dessert was offered but I could not eat another bite.

I would highly recommend this restaurant and looking forward to return."
5,"This is a must try in Chicago. Was open for dine in both indoors and outdoors even though most other places were not. The sampler was very good. I love the boneless wings and the breaded cheese triangles. The pizza was also really good! Different than a deep dish. Its more like a stuffed pizza pie. Very yummy! And great service by the staff.  
I took home the leftover pizza and it tastes just as good cold. Also, my brother claims this is his favorite pizza restaurant in Chicago!"
5,"I traveled to Chicago last month for a quick weekend getaway. I basically flew there just to eat and travel safely due to covid. 

It was my first time trying deep dish pizza and it did not disappoint.

We had gone to other deep dish pizza spots that same weekend but this was my favorite by far. The crust alone was delicious and the toppings.

Can&apos;t wait to go back"
4,"So much cheese! This is of course a staple for Chicago so we had to come try it. After hearing multiple friends talk about this place in particular I chose this one over the several options for deep dish in the city. 

They do have the option to make reservations so I would do that with the capacity limits at the moment. 
The pizza takes a few mins to cook so order an app and wait for a big pie full of cheese,cheese, and more cheese to hit your table. 

Overall it was good but for me just a little too cheesy ;). A small size pie will be enough for 2 as well. We couldn&apos;t even get pass one slice of the deep dish bc of the cheese and then having cheese sticks for an app."
4,"A 4 stars to this icon of Chicago style pizza. I&apos;ve dined here a few times, but most recently got the following:

Family style meal: A medium two topping deep dish pizza, caesar salad, and chocolate chip cookies.

Deep dish pizza: I got all-beef meatballs and green peppers for my deep dish pizza. The pizza was well cooked with meatball and green pepper well layered along side cheese and topped with sauce. The meat to cheese to sauce ratio was well balanced.

The caesar salad was your typical salad with lettuce and cheese. A well mixed  salad, which came with caesar dressing, which was great. The only thing missing from the salad were croutons which I like to have on my caesar salad. 

The chocolate chip cookies were soft and well sweetened. They went well as after pizza dessert.

I ordered thru uber eats. The order was delayed a bit but the staff was nice, and gave paper plates and condiments per request. 

Overall good food and experience!"
3,"I was really hoping to love deep dish pizza - because I love cheese and I LOVE red sauce. Loads and loads of it. So even though so many people hate on deep dish, I was still excited to give it a real chance. We chose Giordano&apos;s for dinner that evening. There was a slight wait but not as bad as I expected. 

We ordered the Giordano&apos;s House Salad (because we had eaten so bad all weekend long) and balanced it with some red sangria. Also got some cheesy garlic bread to munch on while waiting for the deep dish pizza. 

Our server seemed over it. When he brought out the pizza, instead of the big fanfare that other servers did for their table, waiting for the camera to be ready or posing for the photo with the long cheese pull, he quickly sliced and pulled the slice up high and with great reluctance held up the slice after he noticed our frantic scrambling to get a photo. The cheese pull is impressive - and the gold standard for any cheese pull on any cheesy entree. 

Deep dish pizza in general is just too heavy. The pizza was a bit doughy and while I appreciated all the sauce and cheese and pepperoni, it lacked in texture thanks to the slight sogginess. 

While deep dish pizza isn&apos;t my favorite, I wouldn&apos;t mind eating it again at Giordano&apos;s once in a blue moon. I have had better in Atlanta (gasp) but I know that Giordano&apos;s is a classic in Chicago that I have no choice to respect!"
5,"Soooo good. We only had one night in Chicago and I had to have some Chicago-Style deep dish pizza. There are sooooo many choices for pizza in any big city with Chicago perhaps leading them all. We picked Giordano&apos;s as they delivered to our hotel and had several locations. This pizza rocked! I love deep dish and really am glad we chose Giordano&apos;s as they didn&apos;t disappoint. I could eat pizza in this town every day for a year and not be tired of it. 
If I remember, we got a combo or meat lovers type of pizza. It is very filling and we were able to keep some leftovers for the following day&apos;s lunch before we left the city. 
Man, give this place a try if undecided or just to try some authentic Chicago deep dish pizza."
3,"Came for lunch and waited about half an hour before getting a table for four.

Started with a Greek Salad, which was pretty good. Just the small salad was enough for the four of us. Tasted very fresh and was quite good with the banana peppers. 

Then got the Special Chicago Style Deep Dish. Had to wait about an hour for it to come which is about normal for a deep dish pizza. The flavor was pretty good and crust crispy. Wasn&apos;t really my style as there was not nearly enough sauce for me personally. However, all the ingredients were very tasty and the dough fresh. If you&apos;re more into deep dish would probably like this place a lot!"
3,"CALLING ALL PIZZA LOVERS? Have you had a deep dish pizza? 

I can finally say that I have had the famous Chicago Giordano&apos;s Deep dish pizza! Why y&apos;all didn&apos;t tell me it was sooo big. Lol I literally could barley get down one slice with all the appetizers we had. 

How many slices could you eat?

5,"Have dined in here numerous of times. Always get the deep dish, what else is new? lol
Anyways very friendly and super nice place."
5,"I&apos;m a NY pizza boi through and through BUT the deep dish experience here is authentic, delicious and savory. I love the NY thin slice, it&apos;s what I grew up on but Chicago deep dish is legit and needs to be recognized. When in Chicago this is the place to go for deep dish pizza love. Buttery crust, flavorful sauce, gooey cheese and flavorful house made sausage. You will not be disappointed."
4,A nice place to enjoy your pizza with your friends. I was worried that the pizza might be too much but in fact its doable to eat one haha.
5,"I&apos;m so glad we were referred to this place, as the customer service and food was delicious!  Although we were unable to eat inside, they made outside dining a great experience. They have heaters at each individual table and the manager frequently checked on us to ensure we had a great experience. We got the parmesan crusted spinach mushroom deep dish with alfredo sauce and it was cooked to perfection. 

I would definitely recommend you go and check this place out when in Chicago."
4,"Deep dish pizza is a must-try coming to Chicago. A friend recommended trying Giordano&apos;s. As we sat down, we ordered the special choice which had sausage, onions, mushrooms, and green peppers. A small size was a good portion for 3 people. 

After ordering, the waitress said the wait would be 45min or so. That&apos;s probably the longest wait for a pizza I&apos;ve seen but understandable since this is not your average pizza. The pizza then came out, looking humongous on a nice serving plate. 

Normally, I don&apos;t eat my pizza with a knife and fork but this time, it would be difficult to not to. Each slice was thick and everything would pretty much fall apart if I used my hands. It was quite an experience, very delish and leaves you pretty stuffed after two slices."
4,"Classic Chicago Italian!  The staff is friendly, the food is good and the beer is cold. I&apos;ve enjoyed everything I&apos;ve had here. The spaghetti with marinara is one of my favorites!  If you enjoy meatballs add one to your meal. Really good!"
5,"If you&apos;re visiting Chicago, Giordano&apos;s is a must visit for lunch/dinner. One of the premier deep dish pizzas places they do not disappoint. This two story location has plenty of room, great atmosphere, and a fantastic wait staff."
5,First time in Chicago and had to try chicagos deep dish pizza. Of course I stopped by giordanos . And got greeted by Patrick. Treated us welll.  Set up the heater due to only outdoor dining and being 29 degrees out .What a delicious pizza. Great experience.must try
1,"Came to visit friends and family over the weekend. Many people recommended this pizza place saying it&apos;s the best. Well, not quite exactly. Pizza tasted like middle school cafeteria food. Didn&apos;t have much flavor to it. On the other hand, pizza took almost 2 hours to get delivered. I under stand if it&apos;s an hour but 2 hours is crazy as heck ! We tried contacting the restaurant numerous times and it was just pick up and hang up. I would say we called maybe 8 times. Once we finally get someone on the line, the young lady says they&apos;re backed up and only have 2 people working. They could&apos;ve at least picked up and said &quot;could you please hold&quot; as supposed to picking up and hanging Up repeatedly. If I am ever back in Chicago, will not eat pizza from Giordanos."
2,"Deep dish pizzas take about 45 mins so come ready to wait! When we got here it was pretty empty. We started off with a salad and fried calamari. The salad was good but I would have liked it with the pizza since the pizza is pretty heavy and greasy.

For it taking so long, I would have expected the cheese on the pizza to be completely melted and oozing but when we got it, the cheese was a bit solidified. I wish I had a microwave to nuke it in for a bit.

Also, the tab water is absolutely disgusting. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever tasted water so bad in my life."
3,"What to do when you&apos;re in Chicago for the first time? Try the deep dish pizzas!

These famously stuffed pizzas are different than any other pizza you&apos;ve had. It&apos;s THiCC and so filling.

My SO and I came to Giordano&apos;s around 11pm and was told that the deep dish pizzas are the most popular but would take about 40 minutes to make.

Although we contemplated whether to wait so long for a pizza, we decided to was worth the try. We ordered the individual-sized pizza to share since we weren&apos;t very hungry and garlic parmesan fries.

We went with the Chicago classic deep dish pizza which comes with pepperonis, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions. 

Now that you&apos;ve gotten to this part of my review, you&apos;re probably wondering why I gave this place only 3 stars?

The food itself was mediocre. You can barely taste the garlic parmesan in the garlic parmesan fries. Definitely have had better. As for the Deep Dish Pizza, the crust was tasty but the filling and marinara sauce was a bit bland. The mozzarella cheese and the rest of the ingredients tasted warm at best, despite us having waited 40 minutes for"
