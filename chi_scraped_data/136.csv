Big little is the best place new discovery for me in town and they aren&apos;t as expensive as some of these other places and the staff Paul amd Alec and the other guy that&apos; I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t remember how to say his name but their all as good as their tasty burgers and try their spicy fries Cajun very good (: This is my Jew once a week at the very least joint to go too thanks to them all and they give you big portions of lettuce snd onion and tomatoes on it or on the side !Love you guys Roberta Bullock and Jackie
3,"I tried to like it I really did.
I saw this on DDD and figured hey let me check it out since I was in area.
I found staff friendly and super apologetic as I had wait as they had a huge order before me.
I had some tacos that left me disappointed.
The fish yes it&apos;s 2 large pieces. I found the fish had no taste. I was bland like it had not been salted seasoned prior to dredging in batter.
The Cajun  fries tasted like regular fries.
I judge all Cajun fries by Five Guys these I give a 4 out of 10.
I may have gone on a off day but I expected berter."
5,"Get the Ahi Poke Crunch Wrap! The Soft Shell Crab Burger looks good, but let me just say... my boyfriend was sad about it and wanted my crunch wrap. It only looks cool. The crunch wrap has the bursts of flavors and textures. It hits the spot right on! 

It&apos;s a great fast-food feeling spot. You&apos;re in and out. Nothing too fancy. 

I&apos;d rate this place a four-star joint with a five-star crunch wrap. What the heck, I&apos;ll give it five stars. They&apos;ve got some enticing Groupon offers."
1,"After seeing Big and little&apos;s on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, it made it on the list of &quot;things we need to eat in Chicago&quot;. We decided it was worthy of our last meal in the Windy city. Unfortunately, that was an incorrect decision on our part.

-Foie Gras Fries: While I like the idea, and the portion sizing of the foie gras is awesome, this dish just wasn&apos;t there. The foie gras wasn&apos;t even properly deveined. And although the dish was nice and fatty, the fries weren&apos;t very crisp and the foie gras was unpleasant to eat given the veins and it had a much more gamier taste than other foie gras that I&apos;ve been accustomed to. 

-Pork Belly Po-Boy: This item was fine. But that&apos;s all it was, fine. It wasn&apos;t fantastic or amazing. It was just deep fried pork belly squares with sauce. Sandwich did feel dry and needed extra sauce. 

-Al Pastor Taco: This was just gross. Probably the worst taco I&apos;ve ever had. It was just drenched in hot sauce and had no other flavors. 

Maybe I just came with too high expectations but this place was extremely disappointing as our last meal in Chicago. The food was expensive and the restaurant was also far away and not worth the uber trip. 

Cash only."
1,I can&apos;t comment on the food because We might get sick I guess yelp is condoning restaurants that are doing &quot;there best&quot; during Covid 19 but as you can see these people obviously do not have chicago Sanitaion or state Sanitaion licenses or the staff need training because our 15 minutes in B&amp;L showed cashier taking cash then cutting red onions without a hand wash or gloves. Also The cook making food with NO gloves &amp; NO mask. Camera watching customers? lMAO you need cameras watching your dam staff. Eat well &amp; good luck chicago.
4,"This place popped up a few times catching my eye, so of course after creeping on Instagram I decided to head over. After driving around Chicago and quickly learning how horrid it is to find a parking spot this place immediately pleased me by offering a place to leave my vehicle!

Walking in, I was pleasantly intimidated by all the food options that were available. After chatting it up with the staff member (don&apos;t remember your name and awkwardly have to call you staff member--sorry!), I decided to get a taco from each category. I ordered the samurai, mango chutney, and Japanese beef taco.

Overall the tacos were all good! As a huge taco connoisseur, these weren&apos;t the top notch, blow your wig off kinda tacos, but definitely worth checking off the list of places to try in Chicago for tacos. 

I enjoyed the  seafood spin that this place offered to it&apos;s menu as well as the hefty sized tacos and the many options. Considering I didn&apos;t get to try much of the taco or seafood scene while out in Chi-Town, this was a decent stop for both of these fixes. I&apos;d come back and try some more!"
4,"Got take out via UberEats. The cheeseburger was really good. Ordered it well done, and it was definitely well done. The tacos are kind of a rip off. They&apos;re small for $4 and they were good but doesn&apos;t really fill you up. (Blue Cross&apos;s cafeteria has bigger and better tacos for $2.50 each.) I got a Hawaiian pork taco, Japanese beef taco, and sweet and spicy beef taco. They were all greasy and saucy. I&apos;d say the Hawaiian was the best. It&apos;s mildly spicy. It has pineapple. Japanese beef was pretty good. My bf thought it was the best. Both were pretty smoky. And then the Sweet and Spicy beef taco was a lot of sauce. They have a good amount of fries but it would have definitely tasted better if we had eaten there."
4,Stopped for lunch at this location good service and food; especially enjoyed the Samurai Taco. Hope they can make it through JabbaHutt and Groot&apos;s COVID BS!
5,"We&apos;ve had this spot on our bucket list for a while and it lived up to the hype ! We ordered the soft shell crab po boy, fish sandwich, and fried chicken sandwich. They were all so good, you can actually taste the flavors of the fish/crab instead of just fried breading. The vinegar flavor on the po boy and fish sandwich made it taste like you were eating fish and chips on bread. The Cajun fries are seasoned well and went perfectly with the sandwiches. We will definitely be back and work our way through trying the whole menu!"
4,"What an awesome little spot. Can&apos;t beat fried fish done right, especially in the heart of the Midwest where fresh seafood is a little tougher to find. If you can believe it, we don&apos;t have an abundance of fresh, edible sea-life coming out of the Chicago River. There&apos;s certainly other stuff coming out of the Chicago River, but not that. 

BIG &amp; little&apos;s was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives so the first thing you&apos;ll notice as you walk through the door is the signature spray-painted Fieri face on the wall. I&apos;ve been to many a DDD establishment and some aren&apos;t able to live up to expectations. However, BIG &amp; little&apos;s certainly deserves its spot.

The menu is interesting and everything is done right. They are known for their tacos, but they make a hell of a burger and the po&apos; boys are ridiculous. The Ahi Poke Crunch Wrap is a little piece of heaven and you can&apos;t go wrong with a classic fish n&apos; chips basket. 

Most of the fried items and fries don&apos;t travel well, so if you&apos;re going for an order out situation you might want to order appropriately to avoid a soggy food situation. 

While they&apos;ve grown since those first days of Food Network stardom, they&apos;ve managed to keep their food quality and service in check which keeps folks coming back for more."
5,"Don&apos;t judge a book by its cover. The restaurant is located off the beaten path. It&apos;s a block away from street lights, the door on the street is closed and you have to enter through a side parking lot. Go through the blue doors into  a small restaurant. A chalk board menu with foie gras fries and soft shelled crab. This place is gourmet food in a fast food setting with fast food prices. 

I had the foie gras fries and a hot dog with everything. The foie gras was the most I have ever had on a single dish. Two giant seared pieces of foie gras over a bed of fresh cut, piping hot fries. The foie gras melted onto the hot fries coating them. The fries were so rich, this dish needs to be shared. 

The hot dog was grilled to perfection, the relish was electric green. Sliced tomato, pickles, diced red onions, and whole chilies to complete the dish. The heat level and saltines was perfect, maybe even umami. 

You have to try this place. 10 stars if I could."
4,"If you like fish tacos, eat here. If you like spicy fish tacos, run here. But stop by the ATM, because they are a cash-only joint. The samuri was absolutely amazing - it was a nice piece of fish, fried to perfection and topped with pickled jalapenos and some special sauce. It felt a bit pricey at $5.50, but it was well worth it, and If I has eaten two, I would have a been stuffed. (I&apos;m just visiting Chicago, so $5.50 for a taco may be a steal - you can be the judge of that.) The non-fish tacos started at $4 per taco. The raw ahi tuna taco was stuffed to the brim with tuna, but it felt weird in a hard taco. The next time I&apos;m in Chicago, I&apos;ll definitely be back here!"
5,"Fast gourmet food at its finest. I really want to try a burger but the rest of the menu is just has too many fun and delicious  items. My go to item is their Ahi Tuna Poke Crunch Wrap with an order of Truffle Fries. Fries portion size is shareable
 My wife is working her way through the many interesting tacos.  So far I think the Japanese Beef, Mango Chutney, and Spicy Thai are her favorites. But really everything has been Grand and the friendly ordering help is great. Oh and a big plus is the free flowing Diet Pepsi. &quot;Order up for Nancy&quot;."
2,"Saw this place on Diners,DriveIns &amp; Dives so I persuaded my husband to drive 44mins in traffic to get here. Wasn&apos;t worth the drive:( Had our hopes on trying the crab taco which we were informed was no longer available. Tuna Poke Taco was good...it comes with Spicy Mayo &amp; Samurai Sauce(Eel Sauce). I also ordered the Tuna Crunch Wrap &amp; substituted lettuce &amp; cilantro for rice. It was good for the first couple bites, then it just got a little mundane. Towards the end, the 2 sauces soaked thru everything so I chose not to finish it. My husband ordered the fish &amp; chips (up charge for truffle fries). Fish was greasy &amp; fries tasted old. Needless to say we won&apos;t frequent this location anymore. Don&apos;t believe the Hype...FYI they take Cash Only, ATM On-Site."
2,"Came here in a holiday using a Groupon deal ($20 for $12). Got 1/2 fish and chips, big and littles taco, fried shrimp taco, and pork belly po boy. The food was below expectations. The fish was flaky and soft on the inside but was completely lacking in crunch. The tacos were decent but a bit heavy handed on the lettuce. The pork belly po boy was filled with over fried pork belly in an average bread roll. The big and littles taco was the best dish of the 4 but would not come back for it. Even with the Groupon deal."
3,"I wouldn&apos;t have come here if not for the Groupon. With the groupon deal, the prices are a lot more reasonable. However the food I got was simply not that great. The pork belly po boy was very fried and without much flavor. It could use some more juice, and the bread was nothing special. The fish and chips--the fish was tender and soft, however the breading was soggy when I was expecting a crunch. The fish fell apart easily because of that. Fries were unremarkable. Tacos are probably the most worth it item here."
4,"I found this place because it was recommended for a greasy burger by Vice! Turns out that Guy Fieri has been here and it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives!! 

It&apos;s definitely not in a prime location or anything to write home about as far as location and venue goes. It&apos;s a diner-style hole-in-the-wall with an order counter and about 10 tables and booths. It&apos;s a perfect greasy little joint when you are just craving a burger or fried seafood. There was also an impressive selection of tacos on the menu. 

I got the soft shell crab sandwich (the difference between that and the soft shell crab po boy is that the sandwich has more veggies and a sweet sauce with the orange sauce). It was tasty and crunchy. The sweet sauce was a little much but maybe I&apos;ll add a hot sauce to it next time. Two of my friends got the burgers and loved it. They were also both recovering from a hangover and it was a perfect cure. 

A must-get is definitely the truffle fries!! The basket was only $4 and the three of us (granted it was three girls) couldn&apos;t even finish the basket! They were freshly fried with a strong truffle flavor- perfect for pairing with the orange sauce they keep by the counter!"
4,"I went to Chicago a while back, but somehow I forgot to review this place when I was there. I don&apos;t recall what my gf ordered here but I got the soft shell crab sandwich.  Let&apos;s just say my gf wanted a bite of the sandwich and didn&apos;t want to give it back to me! If you like crab but never had a sandwich like this, then get one here! It&apos;s great."
3,"It&apos;s pretty good food. Maybe a little overpriced for what you get but takes a cool picture. The burgers are especially pricey and they do not come with fries. I got the fried softshell crab sandwich. I was not displeased. We also got the kimchee fries. So good. But I hear they&apos;re removing them from the menu... WHY?!

The service was great. The guy taking our order was chatty. Told us what he prefers and what not.

There&apos;s a decent size lot so parking is free and plenty.

This is a cash only joint."
3,"I&apos;m guessing that &quot;little&quot; was better than &quot;BIG&quot; is.

In saying so, I&apos;m not comparing the namesake fellas who started the restaurant.  What I mean is that BIG and little&apos;s might be one of these outfits that is a victim of its own success, a case of some guys with genuine talent possibly spreading it too thin.  Or at least that&apos;s what I suspect, after learning that this still-modest original location has now expanded to a mini-empire of four BIG and little&apos;s restaurants.  In short, I don&apos;t know that the hired staff here or at the other locations can keep up with the skills that the owners brought to the table at the beginning.  

Their concept--fast food elevated by quality (and sometimes relatively exotic) ingredients and high-end cooking skills--probably wasn&apos;t very common when they started BIG and little&apos;s almost a decade ago, but has become more so since.  It&apos;s still an excellent business plan, though.  What&apos;s not to like about a &quot;fast food&quot; restaurant that offers items with choices like ahi tuna, lamb gyro meat, pork belly, short rib, and even fois gras, among other things, all served in an just-above-ramshackle environment?

The item that jumped out at me was the soft-shell crab sandwich.  As far as I can recall, I hadn&apos;t had soft-shell crab since we moved away from New Orleans more than a decade ago, and I very fondly remember the soft-shell crab po-boy out at Jazz Fest, where the crab was always huge and both perfectly fried and tasted fresh and bold and thoroughly dominated the sandwich.  The little soft-shell crab sandwich at BIG and little&apos;s, which is served on a griddled bun, doesn&apos;t measure up by comparison.  These crabs are small-ish, with the legs being tiny enough to get lost in the flavor shuffle, which is dominated by a sweet &quot;special sauce&quot;; only the abdomen really stood out.

We shared the Cajun fries, which came in a big portion and were boldly seasoned, but which were also quite grease-leaden.  Others at the table thought their burger and fish-and-chips were only pretty good.  

In short, a somewhat disappointing experience, given how widely BIG and little&apos;s has been celebrated on TV and elsewhere.

Cash only."
