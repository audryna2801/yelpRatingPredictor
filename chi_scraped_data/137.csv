Overall  5

I love this place! They have a decent amount of non-ramen and ramen options but I&apos;ve only had ramen here. I usually go with the Classic Ramen which is very flavorful. My boyfriend really likes the Spicy Garlic Shoyumen Ramen. Both of the broths are delicious but have unique flavors. My boyfriend and I like to get extra spice, which is on the side so you can add it yourself. That is also really flavorful and not crazy spicy (just add slowly!). 
The service here is always good and has been exceptional during COVID, which I can&apos;t say about a ton of places in Chicago. Everything else looks delicious and someday I will try a different ramen and other dishes on the menu. I love this place and definitely recommend it to everyone."
5,"A rainy fall night calls for one thing and one thing only.. RAMEN. Oiistar is one of our favorite spots in the city! We usually opt for the oiimen classic. The broth is soooo creamy and rich, the pork belly is tender and flavorful and the noodles are cooked to perfection.  Huge portions and reasonable price tags.  Last night we had leftovers so ordered a side of noodles and pork belly to go and got to enjoy round two for lunch today.

Due to covid and the fact that they don&apos;t have any outdoor seating options, they have put up barriers between tables to help make guests feel more separated.  Service is always polite and efficient. Can&apos;t recommend this place enough."
5,"Umami with Hakata noodles and Tonkatsu can&apos;t be beat!! They do not deliver and you must pick up your order; however, we gladly make the drive to Wicker Park whenever we&apos;re in the mood for Ramen. Even when it&apos;s -6 degrees standing outside!"
5,"This is a very yummy ramen restaurant across the street from the walgreens. The beef was DELICIOUSS OH MYYY it was so flavorful and tasty.

I got the spicy garlic ramen and it was sooo big I couldn&apos;t finish it. 

We also tried the famous buns and they were to DIE FOR. My guest and I split one bun, and that was enough to get a taste especially with the amount of ramen we ate after.

Overall, the parking here is a little rough because it&apos;s on a Main Street, but the food was very very yummy and we would definitely return!"
4,"Delicious ramen and bao! My go to is the Oiimen classic.  You get your choice of thin or think noodles. The thin noodles are relatively thick so choose accordingly. Perfect on a cold night!

The bao buns are a great addition or appetizer. I&apos;ve tried almost all of them and always have to get some when I get ramen here. 

Great neighborhood spot and affordable!!"
3,"Fast, friendly A+ service and GIGANTIC bowls of ramen... but lacking in the flavor department.

I swung by here for a late lunch and got the spicy garlic ramen expecting it to pack a punch.  Sadly, it looked much tastier than it was.  While I did really love the huge portion, wavy noodles, delicious succulent pork, and variety of veggies (including cabbage which was interesting), the broth simply fell flat for me.  I didn&apos;t even end up eating the leftovers I took home.  Major props for that pork though - so succulent and melt in your mouth!  I think I&apos;d try another spot next time though."
4,"Holy ramen gds this place is delicious!! 

We ordered 2 buns- mashed and tempura shrimp- both were delicious!!!! Splitting the two filled me up but they were crazy good. 

On to the main show- my boyfriend got the oiiman classic and I ordered the chadolmen with no ground pork extra brisket. I&apos;m drooling thinking about it. 

Can&apos;t wait to come back."
5,"The baos!!! Split four different ones. 6 hour pork shoulder, Goki, Tempura Shrimp, and Tonkatsu. Out of all four my favorite is the tempura shrimp. Had the spicy garlic shoyumen. If you love garlic that is the go to ramen. Everything here is great!"
5,"Came here by the advise of my friends and absolutely don&apos;t regret. Ramen is really good, there is a right balance of spices and flavour. Pork belly is also good. Muscleman is 4 out of 5"
5,"We were waking along Milwaukee and heard good things about this place so decided to give jt a try. It did not disappoint!

The portions were HUGE. And for very decent prices. We tried 3 different buns, all really really good. The pork belly in particular was a huge slab and well cooked so the fatty goodness just melted perfectly as we were eating it. 

The Oiimen was also really good- flavorful broth with lots of great, generous toppings and two huge pieces of pork belly. I had enough to take home and make additional noodles for a whole other bowl of ramen. Not spicy on its own so the waitress was nice and brought me a side of chili oil. 

One thing was that it was a little toasty that day and the doors/windows were all open in lieu of AC so it was a little challenging to eat hot ramen in a hot room. Just a heads up if it&apos;s a super hot day!"
5,I can&apos;t wait for indoor dining to reopen. Really missing the ramen and the mashed potato bun that I used to get here. So tasty!!!!
3,"Came here on a rainy day and naturally this place is flooded with people. There&apos;s no waiting room and you have to awkwardly stand in other people&apos;s way. We were able to grab a seat within 20-30 mins on a Saturday night. 

My boyfriend and I shared two baos and each got a bowl of ramen. To be honest, the baos are a mess and not easy to eat. There&apos;s so much stacked up on each other you can&apos;t even close the bar. It got to the point if not even being able to eat everything on the bao to fully enjoy the plate. 

The ramen was also just ok. I got the spicy ramen and I felt the noodles could be a bit thicker. The pork had a seafood funk to it."
3,"Alright - hear me out , it can&apos;t be a coincidence that multiple people have gotten violently ill after eating here . It wasn&apos;t but 5 minutes after leaving the restaurant that I had to make a pit stop at a grocery store.
Besides getting sick after the meal the food was overall really good.
The bao was amazing and soft , the ramen had a great flavor and the karage was crisped to perfection. One of the best ramen places I&apos;ve been to (especially for apps!). 
Prior to getting sick I said I&apos;d definitely come back - however after the evening I am having I can&apos;t say that I would come back here - and I&apos;ve already thrown out all my leftovers."
4,"This place is pretty good. The wait time can be a bit long because there aren&apos;t that many other ramen places around here and there isn&apos;t that much seating. 

Tried the Oiistar ramen, cucumber salad, and mussels appetizer. The cucumber salad was refreshingly good and the mussels were delicious. Only wish they gave more bread to soak up all that yummy sauce. The broth for the ramen was flavorful and the portions were decent. The pork belly was a bit burnt but overall good ramen and I would come back here again."
5,"Ambiance/service: pretty nice overall restaurant, but it is a tad small and there can be crowding. How a party of 14 and they had the table ready right when it was time for our reservation so that was nice. Our service was good, they even accommodated us when we had a few extra show up.

Food: onto what really matters. I thought the ramen was excellent. I got the garlic tonkotsu and as good as the broth was (and it was rich, flavorful, and overall excellent) the pork was the real star of the show. It was so juicy and melted in your mouth. Some of the best I&apos;ve had at a ramen restaurant. The noodles were to my liking. They were a touch firm and had good texture.

Overall I was really satisfied with the meal as was the rest of the party."
5,"Let me get the ONLY NEGATIVE out first that is barely a negative- I drove past the place a couple times because their sign and name is small 

The inside is not too big, so our party of 4 shared the big table with others strangers. It&apos;s cool to meet new friends 
Anyways the menu is simple! The bowl you get are HUGE! The prices are average but you get so much. You drink the broth for ramen, you&apos;ll find it hard to finish and have a &quot;happy&quot; bowl at the end!
I got the ramen with mussels and I added some brisket and egg to it. I had no problem paying more because everything WAS SO DELICIOUS. Each bowl was rated in spice level and my ramen bowl was a level 3. It 100% brought the heat BUT NO REGRETS!!! 
I had a plenty amount of mussels that filled me up alone. I just had to add the egg for the iconic ramen look!
The second ramen is their more traditional/popular broth. The spice level was a 1 so it only had great flavor without the heat! The heard that ramen was also quite..AMAZING.

10/10

Must go again.

Ps there is a 100 gallon (five or take a gallon) bowl of sangria that welcomes you in."
5,"Best ramen around! My favorite is the Tikkamen. The broth is so flavorful and delicious. So great for a cold, winter night. Second runner up is the Oiimen Classic. I never used to be a fan of pork belly, but this changed my mind! Again, the broth and all ingredients are perfect every time."
5,"Of all the ramen options on Milwaukee, Oiistar is my favorite. 

For as costly as ramen is these days, they make it the best deal and their service is always fast and friendly. My go-to is the Umami. It has the perfect kick of spice to it and they give you a generous amount of noodles, meat, &amp; toppings AND you do not have to pay extra for the soft boiled egg that has been perfect every time. My favorite part is they give you the whole egg- unlike other places that cut it in half for you. I&apos;m weird and love to see the yolk ooze into my broth and cook a teeny bit. Yum. I used to also love the Oiimen with a side of suicide paste and add enough for a kick. The Umami is just easier and always consistent.

Also, their chicken wings are OUT OF THIS WORLD. Drenched in sauce and garlic and fried to absolute crispy perfection. I&apos;ve never had wings like theirs before and now it&apos;s a must every time we go."
5,"This was my very first experience with Ramen at a restaurant and my first experience eating street buns! I loved every minute of it. I&apos;ve been converted. Those buns were super amazing. Perfectly fluffy, almost melt in your mouth. We tried one of each and we were not disappointed. Definitely worth visiting again:)"
2,"I&apos;ve been here twice because my friend loves it, saying its the best ramen in the city. Well, anything is possible. 

The space is pretty tiny and it can get very crowded, staff though are pretty nice and try to accommodate as much as possible given the tight quarters.

My first visit I had the Chadolmen, an easy choice; a little Korean influence that was pretty good, and I figured the broth wasn&apos;t as rich since  because of it, not bad.

My most recent visit I got the Spicy Garlic Shoyumen, something a little more traditional so I figured the flavor profile would be similar. The broth was pretty flat, even after popping the yolk into it. 

There&apos;s just a richness there that&apos;s missing, which I think is so critical in a ramen, even if it&apos;s a fusion dish that isn&apos;t present."
