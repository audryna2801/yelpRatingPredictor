5,"This place is simply a gem. Have you ever felt what it feels like to be chosen by God? To feel as if you are completely and absolutely in the supreme right place at the right time because you are surrounded by so much beauty and warmth? This is how I felt when I stepped into Panes. This Wednesday was haywire. My partner got in a bike accident and I need to drive her to the ER because she barley had any short term memory and was concussed most likely and hurt. Well they took her in and I wasn&apos;t allowed to go in because of COVID-19. So I had t wait for agonizing two plus hours. This whole time now knowing what&apos;s going on and if she was ok. They wouldn&apos;t let me sit inside cuz of covid 19 so I went on a Little walk around the lake view area. Ans I turned a corner and there was panes. I was hoping they servers coffee or tea but I didn&apos;t quite know. I took my chances and pulled open the door handle as it was warm with yellow light in there and beautiful colorful walls, I felt beyond safe and secure. I asked them if they serve coffee and tea and they said both. Then I got two cookies, a cowboy needs a treat while his partner is in the ER, I got a monster cookie and a chocolate chips. I got two so my partner can have a treat. As I was checking out I also said fck it and bought a loaf of sourdough it was a good price like 2.75$. I felt like I was in New Mexico in that place. It was just so homey and right and warm. It was everything I imagine my eternal resting place to be in the arms of god. Natural. Warm. Cozy. Not to mention the perfectness cookie I have ever ever ever eaten. She also dumped honey in my black tea for me which was nice. Idk I feel like I traveled when I went there. It saved me. I enjoyed my tea and cookie out in the cold bench at the courtyard at the hospital. Thanks Danes, I hope to come back and try one of those tasty looking sandwiches too. Maybe a BLT."
5,"Sandwiches are divine. I&apos;ve never had a &quot;sweet french bread&quot; but that sh*t was on point as well. Highly recommend. Do call restaurant if you want pickup over ordering in-store, as it seems the ordering service used is wonky. There was a rather distraught Karen in today while we waited for our order. Prices very reasonable for how full we are. Highly recommend!"
5,I am so glad I decided to walk into Panes today - it is unbelievably amazing.  The &apos;Turkey Turkey&apos; is literally the best sandwich in the entire world! Such a hidden gem of the neighborhood. I cannot wait to go back.
5,Great sandwiches and neighborhood cafe - love their specialty sandwiches on the homemade bread - the pasta is also solid
5,"I stopped in for lunch and got the Pollo Diablo and Garlic Potato Salad. I also got to sample my boyfriend&apos;s monster cookie which was literally one of the best cookies I&apos;ve ever had. The Garlic Potato Salad was made fresh and amazing. The Pollo Diablo was served on delicious bread and I wished I had gotten 2 sandwiches! They also throw in a bag of chips. The price is superb for what you get. If you&apos;re in the neighborhood, definitely stop in."
5,We recently picked up a couple of sandwiches for lunch. I&apos;m not sure why I&apos;ve never stopped here because it was so good! The bread was tasty and fresh! I&apos;m looking forward to trying more!
4,"I&apos;ve walked past Panes Bread Cafe many times before over the years and sad that I haven&apos;t stopped by sooner! The cafe has been here for 25 years and recently just started accepting credit cards (according to recent yelp reviews).

I ordered the banana pecan French toast for ~ $6.95. It was such a steal and absolutely delicious! I even had leftovers because the portion was generous.

The cafe is counter service (like every cafe). It had a large food menu (brunch menu and lunch menu, which consisted of sandwiches, pasta, and other typical lunch options).

I didn&apos;t see a lot of drink options on the menu, but it did look like they had a huge fridge full of soda,  and bottled waters).

All in all, was pleasantly surprised by my visit!"
5,"I absolutely love this place. Moved in down the block a few months ago and I can&apos;t go a week without going to Panes at least once. Best sandwich I&apos;ve had in the entire city! You have to try it yourself to believe it!

Had to update the review because the food keeps getting better. Tried the Todo Italiano today and it was incredible! Love this place."
4,"Really adorable cafe. My girlfriend and I decided to stop by for a quick breakfast; I ordered the French Toast, since they use some of their own bread for it. It was a really simple, but well-executed dish. For the price point, I thought Panes was an extremely good deal; I also left feeling pretty full, as it was a generous amount of food. 

We also picked up a loaf of their Chocolate Chip Banana bread, which we later took turns devouring at home. It was still warm when we bought it, which really emphasized that &quot;homemade&quot; quality! Definitely one of my favorite little cafes in Chicago!

Pro tip, they also recently started to accept Credit Card payments!"
5,"We came in on Sunday and grabbed the bruschetta, monster cookie, turkey turkey sandwich and pollo diablo. The turkey turkey was fantastic and so was the bruschetta. The bread was so soft. The monster cookie was wonderfully flavorful. We will definitely be returning."
5,"I would happily go back here. OMG the bread....I mean I love bread, but this was amazing!

My sandwich was quick, fresh and delicious and fairly priced. Great little neighborhood spot, really nothing to ding them on."
5,"I really enjoyed the rosemary olive oil bread. The breads are labeled whether or not they contain milk, which is great for a person with a dairy allergy. Their bread is baked well and nice and soft on the inside. The service is friendly and straight to the point."
5,Amazing local spot for fresh sandwiches. All their baked goods are delicious &amp; their bread by the loaf is amazing. Very fairly priced and friendly. Support local business!!!
5,"I love this place. I&apos;ve had the grilled chicken club and the roasted beef and they were both amazing. Their fresh, in-house baked bread is incredible, and all of the ingredients were super fresh. A sandwich and chips for less than $10 in this area is pretty amazing, especially at their quality. Highly recommend this little place."
5,Fresh bread everyday. Terrific desserts. The best salads. Tasty sandwiches. All for a low price. You won&apos;t leave here hungry as the portion sizes are fairly large.
5,The best sandwiches around! I&apos;ve tried several and never been disappointed. Make sure to get dessert too!
5,"Great Cafe. Very nice staff. Amazing food. VERY reasonable on cost. Top of the line bread! 
I&apos;ve been going for years and will continue."
5,"Always amazing. The bread any everything else is so fresh and delicious! We have been going here for years, and have always had great food."
5,"Great food and great prices. You can&apos;t beat that. Their carrot cake is very tasty, but not super sweet."
5,"So amazing! I got the turkey turkey sandwich and was not disappointed. The bread was freshly made and delicious. It made all the difference. The whole store smells like freshly made bread, I can&apos;t wait to go back and try their other sandwiches. Another positive is that the sandwich was huge, so I walked away with left overs. They&apos;re cash only though, so make sure you have cash when you go. If not, they have an atm in the store."
