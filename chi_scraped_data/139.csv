5,"Recently attended for a 60th Birthday party. Staff was, as always, very attentive.  The social distancing and mask mandate were well tended to.  
Without a doubt, this was and always has been the best rib-eye steak we&apos;ve ever had in Chicago!  The sides were ample and flavorful and the drinks of the best quality. 

 We&apos;ve been going there for 30 years and it still remains our special occasion favorite.

Bring back the steak tartare and the Key Lime pie!!!!

Thanks, waiter Paul, for your kindness to our mother and your service."
5,"Ordered Thanksgiving dinner from Capital Grill. I&apos;ll never cook Thanksgiving dinner again! Dinner was delicious! The turkey was most and flavorful, the stuffing was moist, and the sweet potatoes were to die for!

Thanks Capital Grill for making the pick up easy, preparing such a delicious meal, and helping us to make a challenging Thanksgiving special."
5,"They have curbside pickup with a modified menu during the pandemic. We order the clam chowder, Caesar salad with steak, beef tenderloin sliders and a slice of flourless chocolate cake. It was perfectly prepared, heated and ready to eat. The food is great, even without the great inside service and atmosphere. 
It&apos;s a great way to have a great meal while supporting the staff!







This is such a well run, professional, and good food restaurant. I had lunch with a friend and they are so attentive. When we were low on water, soda, or anything else we  needed they reacted. It may be one of the best restaurants in Chicago for business. Tables aren&apos;t to close and the noise level is talkable. 
We both like a light lunch and both started  with the mushroom soup which had a deep flavor without being heavy with cream. I love the Caesar salad with shrimp which is perfect in every way, other than making it at your table!
My friend had the wedge which was exactly as e"
5,"This restaurant was a amazing! 
The host to the the server to the bartender kitchen staff and management gave off such positive vibrations.
Big big up for the chef Patrick for making me and my family feel sooo welcomed, and taking the time to go over the menu and really caring about our interest in foods. 
Anyone you bring here Will enjoy just being in the atmosphere. it was a very nice to be around genuine people that all moved in one accordance. If I didn&apos;t know the chain name I would have though that restaurant was family owned. They make you feel at home. 
Now for the food 
For starters I started with the the crab cakes. Where&apos;s the pictures? Welp, let&apos;s just say once I saw them I dived right for the fork. Its melt in you mouth delicious. I love crab cakes and this has been the best crab cakes I&apos;ve tasted not only in Chicago but in my entire life. So the crab cakes are a absolute must. And please do dip it in their sause or ask for a extra side because  it made the crab cake whole. 
For my entree 
I had a &quot;bone in filet with soft shell crab&quot;
It was also enjoyable lots of tangy yet savory flavors that all combined into a utopia in my in my mouth.
Their sause recipe it what really gives all their food this amazing satisfaction to the tounge and right to your soul. The sause that was in my plate was  &quot;tomato saffron bernaise&quot;my grand mom and friend both had the lamb chops ! They loved it ...my grand mom a picky eater but she finished her plate clean. I had a bite and it was a good lamb chop. I don&apos;t eat much lamb but u know it&apos;s good when the meat cuts tenderly off the bone! 

We then had some coffee befor the dessert and their coffee was even amazing for it not being a cafe ! It came with the cutest white crystal rock that went as a perfect accent, for the taste of the coffee. 

For dessert we had the coconut  cream pie , expresso cake and a cheese cake .I never do dessert but because my yoga instructor flaunted about how amazing their coconut cream pie tasted I decided to have a cheat day. I&apos;m not big on dessert but between the 3 of us each desserts was perfectly portioned where you can enjoy the taste and not fill stuffed.

This restaurant is a must if you want to celebrate, have a friends day or just simply go to eat alone, your smile will grow bigger each minute you sit eat talk inside of the capital grille.This restaurant I can tell, the management is on point. They serve to satisfy and treat everyone like family. Thank you so much! Me and my grandmother will always come back. This  is my new favorite place! 
And thanks agin chef Patrick for catering to our needs. 
Wish I had more photos but I was so busy enjoying myself !"
5,"We went for RW while visiting from DC. From the fixed menu we started out with the greens and caesar salad. Followed that with the lamb and the kona crusted sirloin with the mashed potatoes as the side. To finish she had the creme brûlée  and I had the sorbet. We also added the infamous lobster mac n cheese. 

I preferred the lamb over the sirloin and the lobster mac was fantastic. This was a great experience and I am surprised at the level of quality for a chain. We will definitely visit the Capital Grille, hopefully for DC&apos;s RW."
5,Lobster bisque was calling my name; rich and creamy with generous chunks of lobster. Just how I like it. Also ordered the cheeseburger; a premium blend of beef with caramelized onions and truffle fries. An absolute divine treat. How I missed the days of dinning in as well as more options. Service is always impeccable and I love that they remember me.
4,"Been going here for years and years-but have not been for some time, and tied it for a late lunch today, since Mayor ------- opened the restaurants again.  I had the a cup of clam chowder and the lamb chops. 4 thick lollypop-type chops cooked perfectly, albeit somewhat fatty. Both chowder and chops really good. Wife had the filet with lobster. Also great. Really great wine by the glass and very reasonable ($60 a glass for house red-just kidding). Fabulous cheesecake for desert. Why 1 star. Service a li&apos;l slow when hardly anyone in there. I live in River North, so kinda out of the way for me. May go back."
5,"My husband took me here today for Valentines Day lunch! It was amazing! They gave me a rose when I got there! You get bread to start our with that was yummy and warm! We ordered clam chowder, so good! Then we got the Porcini rubbed rib-eye with bone steak with balsamic (they even split it for us) medium well, to die for!! Cooked perfectly, so soft it melted in your mouth! The side we got were mashed potatoes, best I have had and Brussel sprouts, very good too! We then ordered desert, chocolate cake with banana ice cream, that not so good. And the coconut cream pie, also hot very good! But besides the desserts everything was perfect!! The service was amazing and the atmosphere beautiful!"
5,"Had a great experience as always tonight at capital
Grille! Jasmin was very accommodating and 
Also the staff. Don&apos;t have to say anything about the food speaks for itself! 

Thank you!"
5,"Wonderful experience. We came here for my boyfriends birthday and made reservations in advance. Making the reservations online was incredibly easy, the service was incredible, we both got steaks that entirely melted in our mouths, and they even gave us complimentary cheesecake for his birthday which also tasted fantastic! 10/10 recommend and we will definitely be returning."
5,My husband and I celebrated our Wedding Anniversary and Valentine&apos;s Day and the food was scrumptious we shared bone in ribeye and sea bass which were all prepared to perfection!
4,"The wife and I decided to head out and celebrate my return from service. We were greeted warmly and seated right away. Ambiance was great and staff were very nice. 

The manager came over and gifted our table with a complimentary bottle of Purple Heart wine. Delicious by the way. 

We ordered the lobster and crab cake for the appetizer. It was delicious. 

Main entrees included New York strip (medium), lobster mac and cheese. All were great. 

My wife had the maple seared salmon and it also was decadent. 

Our server Blair was great and made sure we had room for the complimentary desert. 

We can&apos;t wait to go back! 

Thanks Blair!"
5,"YES YES YES!  The Capital Grille just does it all so well.  I recently visited this location for the first time to partake in the Wagyu &amp; Wine event.  For $25 I was able to pick between three different Wagyu beef burgers (different toppings) and enjoy a glass of one of three 100+ year old vineyard wines not normally offered by the glass.  

First, sit at the bar unless you&apos;re entertaining clients or on a special date.  The bartenders are engaging, you can watch whatever game is on (if that&apos;s your thing), and you probably get faster service.  I felt very fancy since they poured out Fiji bottled water for my normal tap water.  Heck yes!  If you get it at the table is $8 per bottle.  

Our kind bartender gave us a heads up about the wines - how to qualify each so that we&apos;d make a great decision.  We did and were each very happy with our selections and burgers.  

P.S. Sign up for their email updates - The Generous Pour (wine event) is one of my favorites!  

(I&apos;m really sad I forgot to take photos!)"
5,"This is a classy place that is a top tier steakhouse. The steaks are served ala carte so you&apos;ll need to order some sides. If you have several people in your group, the portion for a side dish is large and easily sharable with 2-3 adults. 

The steaks are cooked to perfection. The meat is top grade and seasoned at a level never experienced at similar high end steak restaurants. I ordered a pepper crusted porter steak, photo attached. The picture doesn&apos;t do it justice. It was the best porter I&apos;ve ever had."
5,"I came here during restaurant week and it was worth the $36 for sure. The atmosphere was definitely super friendly and I appreciated the customer service that was given and provided. 
I got the clam chowder, the NY strip 14 oz, and then with a side  of mashed  potatoes. For dessert it was a creme brûlée and OH BOY, it was so worth.
The clam chowder was super creamy and flavorful with it without the oyster crackers. The mashed potatoes were soft and fluffy  and the creaminess of that was delicious as well. The strip was juicy and so perfect as well. 

I recommend coming to this place for restaurant week, I still have yet to go for regular business hours and not restaurant week!"
5,I came here for my anniversary and let me tell you........ the best MEAT EVER!! Our server and host were amazing. With everything going on with COVID they were extremely clean and social distanced! Our table was decorated with sparkles and they wrote us a note. I will definitely come back. The food overall was amazing. We got the Mac and Cheese which was Phenomenal!!!! I think I got the NY Strip steak but it was BOMB! Also I got like a cucumber vodka lemonade which was great. Everything was a surprise and I loved it. They made my day so special
5,"Excellent steak, excellent service. The ambiance has a brutish colonial feel to it, very charming. I&apos;ve gone to the one in Baltimore which was also wonderful hence why I wanted to try this location. I would highly recommend this place. Make sure to make a reservation I&apos;m sure during rush hour they are very busy. I came fairly late and still approximately 75-80% of the resturant was  full. 

Tip- if you traveling solo you can get the sides in half order."
3,The Capital Grille was OK! But no where near worth the price. I ordered a medium New York Strip and it was cooked overly well done.. that is.. offensive. How could I recommend this? I can&apos;t. There are way too many better restaurants in the area for this nonsense.. especially after waiting 40 minutes past our scheduled reservation. Next!
5,"Came here again on November 4 for our anniversary and I just had to do ANOTHER 5 star review because I promise you, this place is beyond worth the money and I can&apos;t even put into words how amazing this restaurant is. I could not recommend this place enough.

My now fiance =) and I had a reservation, but we got here earlier than the reservation and still got seated right away. We got a table with cute little heart confetti all over our table, and everyone kept telling us happy anniversary. We even got a hand-written card given to us at our table by the hostess. The coat guy was even super nice, and he helped me take my coat on and off, AND at the end of dinner, he even remembered which coats were ours even without giving him our coat check tickets. 

We ordered the prosciutto mozzarella, which was basically a mozzarella stick, but instead of breading, it was wrapped with prosciutto. WOW is all I can say because it was damn amazing and very unique. Never tried that anywhere else, and never even heard of it anywhere else. On the day we came, they had a drink on special, and we both even got a cute little champagne glass for a free sample of it. My fiance loved it and decided to order it, but it was too strong for me so I ordered a glass of wine. I really wanted moscato, but they only sell it by the bottle, so our waiter recommended a fruity wine to me and I loved it. We then ordered our main courses.Both of us ate a dry aged New York Strip, and I got a lobster tail on the side, while he got scallops. We were both SO happy with what we ordered and we got au gratin potatoes as a side to share. THEN, our waiter gave us a complimentary dessert on a plate that said happy anniversary on it. It was a mini cheesecake and a mini dark chocolate espresso cake, and he told us to try them together. We did and WOW again! I promise you, you cannot go wrong with anything here.

If you didn&apos;t realize already, we had above and beyond service from our waiter John David. He was such a friendly guy, and he was so funny. He even took a picture of us and gave it to us before we got our bill, and then I received a handwritten Capital Grille card in the mail from him thanking me for coming to celebrate at The Capital Grille and saying that he cannot wait to see us again in the future. 

Yes, this place is expensive, but you should know that coming in. Just walking through the doors, you feel that you are in an upscale restaurant and that even the air you breathe is expensive. Don&apos;t let the prices deter you from enjoying a romantic date. Obviously this probably won&apos;t be a place you come to every week, but once a year or two is SO worth it. This was our third time coming here, and it has gotten better every single time we have been here.

We didn&apos;t get this the last time, but the lobster mac and cheese is an absolute MUST TRY."
4,"Not a meal but an experience! We can get to that later though. I came for a friend during restaurant week after she kept raving about the bone in ribeye . 
So into the experience.
Walking in, I immediately thought of my father. Old, rich, conservative, and boozie (not boushie but that too). The ambiance is definitely old money. At least on this night the crowd was a good diverse mix.
The food .....
I got the bone in Kona dry aged steak and mashed potatoes. It wasn&apos;t bad at all. Quality meat with great texture and flavor. Good but in spite of the coffee rub, almost boring. HOWEVER..... that damn bone in rib eye . I almost hollered! Every bite after buttery bite.... Good God Jesus I&apos;ve seen the light! 
I will be back.
With my dad 
And I will have that bone in ribeye experience again 

Capital Grille is an in shape silver fox with dough
A sexy MILF/DILF

I won&apos;t say anything if you don&apos;t!"
