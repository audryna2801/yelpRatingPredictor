4,"For BRG Restaurant Week, Duck Duck Goat was offering a Chongqing chicken pre-set dinner which included potstickers, pickled cucumbers, veggie fried rice, grilled shishitos, and Chongqing chicken. As a Chinese American, I grew up eating many Chinese dishes, and was very pleased with  the authentic flavors in the dishes that we ordered! 

The potstickers were phenomenal! I think they were pork (not positive) but were packed with flavor and moisture inside and fried to perfection on the outside. Pickled cucumbers weren&apos;t anything special, but were a nice touch to balance the spiciness of the rest of the dishes. Their veggie friend rice was composed of multiple  vegetables including snap peas, mushrooms, bok choy, peppers, and butternut squash. The rice to veggie ratio was perfect in my opinion! The grilled shishitos was another favorite. They weren&apos;t spicy and the grilled flavors really shined through. I could probably eat these peppers for days! As for the main chicken dish, I was slightly disappointed. A lot of the chicken pieces were overcooked, dry, and difficult to chew. However the pieces that weren&apos;t overcooked were delicious! Although the dish looked very spicy, it was actually manageable, especially since I usually cannot take any spice! We paired all of this with a bottle of our own red wine as a birthday celebration, and had enough for another meal the following day! The price was very reasonable and pick-up was efficient and easy! I&apos;m excited to try more of their dishes in the future!"
4,"I ordered from here on New Year&apos;s Eve, and their takeout process was perfect. They have a little take out window on the side of the building so you do not need to enter the restaurant to pick up your order. The staff were so friendly and my food was ready on time. 
I was impressed the the soft boiled egg was still cooked perfectly when I took home my duck fried rice. It was the perfect gooey-ness and melted over the top of the rice. 
I also had the goat beef slap noodles which were my least favorite. This dish was completely overspiced and it tasted like the spices were not cooked down. Very overpowering flavors and the entire dish tasted dry. 
My wife enjoyed the chongquing chicken. It was crisp and tender on the inside and the sauces that came with our order tasted great with the dish!"
5,"Due to unexpected gorgeous weather in November, we were finally able to snag a reservation at Duck Duck Goat! With indoor dining being restricted, we were sat at one of the many tables they have set up on the street to the side of the restaurant. 

FYI the menu seems to be a little condensed with less offerings than before, at the current time. With that being said,

Our order was as followed: 
XIAO LONG BAO (goat and duck soup dumplings) $13 for 4 dumplings
WOOD-FIRED CHAR SIU BBQ RIBS $17 for 5 ribs
DUCK FRIED RICE (jasmine rice with peking duck meat, seasonal veggies and a soft boiled duck egg) $17
GLASS NOODLES (seasonal veggies, mushrooms, apples )$16 
PICKLED CUCUMBERS $7 

Stand outs were the soup dumplings and the ribs. The ribs were tender and flavorful and didn&apos;t feel skimpy on the meat. Soup dumplings were juicy and packed with a nice ginger- esque broth! 

They recommended us to get 4-6 plates to share. With the 5 entrees we ordered, we had more than enough food and ended up taking home leftovers. 

Everything was stellar, though. Food came out extremely fast. We were in and out in under an hour. Something to note: they do bring dishes to you as they&apos;re ready, not all at once. 

WE WILL BE BACK."
5,"Duck Duck Goat is a great spot, you can&apos;t go wrong if you choose to eat here.  We came a few months ago for the second time and enjoyed it.  I&apos;m a fan of all the goat establishments.  Their combination of vibe and funky food always make for a good evening out.

When I think of the food at Duck Duck Goat, I think of Chinese, but not the traditional Chinese that we are used to.  It&apos;s more like elevated Chinese food with fresh ingredients and interesting additions.  

Some of my favorites were the Beef and Broccoli, the Jiaozi (a little expensive for what you get, but still tasty), and the star of the show, the Duck Fried Rice.  The addition of the soft boiled egg on the Duck Fried Rice is genius, making this easily my favorite dish of the night."
5,"Still my favorite. Been here several times and it is consistently amazing. Our favorites are: pork buns, soup dumplings, pork fried rice, green beans, and jiaozi. Atmosphere is fun too."
5,"Stephanie Izard has done it again! We were very pleased with our experience at Girl and the Goat, so decided to try one of her other venues. We were hesitant to dine out due to the current on-going pandemic, however, saw that the outdoor seating space at Fulton Market was set up nicely and protocols were in place to ensure customers were protected. 

For dining during lunch, they had a fixed tasting menu along with a la carte dim sum options. The tasting menu had about 6 different items, our favorites being the soup dumplings, duck fried rice omelette, and beef salad. We also had some servings of the dim sum pork buns and duck fried spring rolls, both were also delicious. Service was excellent, with everyone wearing masks and providing guidance on sampling some of the dishes. We felt very safe throughout the experience, and the menu was well worth the cost. Thanks and looking forward to the next visit!


Best,
Charlie"
4,"Trying to soak up Chicago dining before it gets cold and everything gets shut down again...came to Duck Duck Goat. Yes I&apos;ve lived in Chicago for a while now and finally get to try Duck Duck Goat when I was sober. So let&apos;s start. Speaking of sober, started off with getting their house old fashion. I don&apos;t believe it was on their menu, but whoever the bartender was the night we went to Duck Duck Goat, it was phenomenal. The Old Fashions kept coming all night, or I should say the 1.5 hours you&apos;re allowed to dine in during the pandemic and trust me they were a handful. 

For the food, we went with the Jiaozi. These are fried dumplings, pot stickers whatever you want to call it. It was a good dish. Nothing crazy but for $15, it sucked. You&apos;re crazy for charging me $15 for 5 pot stickers. But we got it anyways, and it was fine. LOL. 

The Wood-fired Char Siu BBQ ribs were delicious. Again, insanely overpriced but worth getting. I enjoyed it. Comes with 5 pieces and eating with 2 other guys, not ideal for my stomach. I need more!

Duck fried rice, very buttery. Am I going to complain there was a lot of butter in the food? No I won&apos;t. It was extremely buttery but maybe because I was going deep with the old fashions, it hit the spot perfectly. 

Xi&apos;an Goat Slap Noodles. Lived in NYC and had Xian Noodles in front of my face, but this dish was extremely flavorful for tasty. Am I crying in my sleep that I had to pay $19 for it? Absolutely, but go big or go home. 

All in all the food is very Americanized here. It&apos;s delicious, flavorful, buttery, and expensive. If that&apos;s what you are craving, go here. I&apos;ll come back again. Atmosphere is great. Another great west loop spot."
5,"Honestly have been a huge fan of Stephanie Izard from the the get go on Top Chef! This is a great little Asian food spot in Chicago and you should definitely stop by. Everything we tried was absolutely delicious. The hand pulled noodles are fabulous and they actually offer a vegetarian mapo tofu which is tasty as well! Also if you see dumplings on the menu, you absolutely need to order them. Don&apos;t miss out, you can&apos;t let that happen!

The pricing is a bit high end but honestly it&apos;s worth it as the restaurant does their best to take care of their staff! I would definitely come here again the next time I am in Chicago!"
5,"Chef Stephanie Izard is truly talented. This is my favorite creative Chinese restaurant in Chicago. Tasty food, beautiful interior, fun vibe for a date, family, or friends night out. Best dumplings in town along with their flavorful spicy chicken and goat dishes. So glad indoor dining is finally open and this was my first stop. 
FYI... They don&apos;t have their full menu right now but still plenty to pick from."
5,"Loved this restaurant! Came here for a birthday dinner over the weekend and were lucky enough to be able to order the Peking Duck special, it was delicious! It came with toppings and sauces for the duck and they come over and explain how to eat it properly. We also ordered Char Siu Pork Bao Buns which were AMAZING, Crab Rangoon that were very tasty and crispy, shishitos, and glass noodles that were so delicious. The drinks were great and they also brought out a complimentary dessert for the birthday we were celebrating. Overall had a really fun dinner experience here."
5,"Dining at Duck Duck Goat was so much fun!! The service and the atmosphere (considering the outdoor dining) was a bit disorganized but the food beat everything.
Everything we tried was just delicious. The cocktails were top notch as well. We ordered many dishes and shared some appetizers and we loved them. I ordered the braised pork belly and I loved how tender it was and the amount of pickled veggies I got. The noodle dish was also delicious. Almond cookie given for free at the end of the meal is also perfectly warm, crunchy, and nutty.
I think the service could be improved though. We did outdoor dining and that could have been why the service was slightly worse than expected but the heat lamp went out of fuel at least twice and we were left in the windy Chicago winter weather. Everyone was so busy so we barely got any service at our table and had to try very hard to make eye contacts with the restaurant employees.
To end things in a good note, the contactless payment option was fantastic. We went with a group of friends and the payment option made splitting sooo easy. I will definitely return as long as I can make a reservation!"
4,"Updated Review: Dined here during COVID and sat on their patio. We had to secure a reservation by paying a $50 deposit and it was applied to our final invoice. We tried the Potstickers, Scallion Pancakes, Baos, Duck Fried Rice and Chicken Dish. It was all very flavorful but quite salty. We especially liked the Potstickers and Duck Fried Rice. 


5 stars for food quality but 1 star for service. I made a reservation for my boyfriends birthday at 7:30pm. We arrived on time but told us they needed to clear a table. They proceeded to bring us to a tiny room full of other couples in the same situation. We ended up waiting in the hallway until 8pm when we were seated. We get to our table and are ready to order drinks and dim sum but no one checks on us for another 15 minutes. Once we place our order, we never see our server again. The food was delicious but the service was frustrating."
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to go to one of Stephanie&apos;s Izard&apos;s dinner restaurants for a long time. I frankly wasn&apos;t impressed with most of my food at Little Goat Diner but I wanted to give a dinner establishment a try. And this one was a success! We absolutely loved the food! We decided to go with the Prix Fixe menu for $38 per person. Now, I know after looking at the menu, we could&apos;ve gotten a bit larger portions of each item for roughly the same price. However, I don&apos;t regret doing this because I tried things I may not have otherwise that I absolutely loved and I was able to try a little bit of everything.

This included:

JIAOZI - Beef short rib and bone marrow potstickers (4):
10/10 - this one surprised me! I&apos;ve had gyoza in the past and I really didn&apos;t enjoy it but these had the perfect crisp on the outside with a soft dumpling and melt in your mouth meat in the center. I would absolutely order these on a future trip!

PICKLED CUCUMBERS (1 shared plate):
10/10 - for a seemingly simple dish, these were actually really delicious! I really enjoyed the mix of kind of sour and sweet with a little bit of a kick. I had low expectations for just pickled veggies but I think these are worth getting if you enjoy pickled veggies.

VEGGIE FRIED RICE (1 shared bowl)- 
Brown and jasmine rice with glass noodle bits:
10/10 - This was the star of the show in my opinion. If it hadn&apos;t been on the prefix menu, I would not have ordered this. I would&apos;ve definitely opted for a meat option but I&apos;m so glad this was on there because we absolutely loved it! The flavor was super powerful and delicious. They gave you a pretty good portion I thought for the Prix Fixe menu. All the veggies were fresh and crunchy and the egg was delicious. I would definitely prefer some meat in my fried rice but this is a &quot;must.&quot;

WOOD-FIRED CHAR SIU RIBS (4):
9/10 - Great crisp on the outside and good glaze, I thought the meat could&apos;ve been a little bit more tender but that could&apos;ve just been the cut. Very delicious! I would definitely get them again.

XI&apos;AN GOAT SLAP NOODLES - Cumin, finger hot chili, goat shoulder (1 shared plate):
2/10 - here was my sole disappointment of the meal. I will preface this by saying that I absolutely detest cumin and I can pick it out in even small amounts. It was listed with cumin on the menu however I couldn&apos;t switch it out because of the Prix Fixe. In the future, I would never order this. I found it to be overwhelmingly cumin forward to the point that it was really unappetizing to me personally. However, I recognize that as a preference. My fiancé who also doesn&apos;t love cumin but is less adverse to it, said he would rate this an 8/10.

SOFT SERVE - Vanilla soft serve with option of blueberry sorbet swirl:
10/10 - get the swirl! My fiancé got the plain vanilla and I opted for the swirl and we agreed that it was surprisingly delicious. When I think of sorbet I think Of more of a frozen icy mixture but this was very soft and creamy. The blend of the two together was delicious! It wouldn&apos;t be my favorite ice cream of all time but for what it was, I think they hit the nail on the head. For a reasonable price, I would definitely get this on a future trip.

They finished up our meal by bringing a couple almond cookies with the bill. I thought this was a nice gesture but I do have to say the cookies left something to be desired. They were your average store-bought crisp almond cookies. I personally prefer kind of a soft chewy cookie so it just wasn&apos;t impressive to me but again, a nice gesture.

OVERALL - i&apos;m going to give DuckDuckGoat a 5/5 because given the Covid situation, I thought they handled everything really well. The dishes came out warm and as they were ready. The food was absolutely delicious except for the one dish that goes against my preferences. It was an overall win! I think the Prix Fixe menu is a great option to try a little bit of everything but next time I would just order the items that we found to be worth the cost. This would include the Jiaozi, the fried rice, and the soft serve. I would probably try a different rice variation, chili noodles, and another meat option to switch it up next time. But there will definitely be a next time!"
5,"Delicious food!! This place has elevated Chinese food and lots of great flavors. We ordered delivery from here and all of our food arrived warm and in good condition. 

We got the jiaozi, chongqing chicken, goat slap noodles, and duck fried rice. All of the dishes were delicious! My favorites were the duck fried rice and goat slap noodles. The duck fried rice was flavorful and the soft boiled duck egg on top added extra richness to the dish. The goat slap noodles had unique flavors with the cumin and added spices. 

Definitely would get food here again! The food is amazing and I&apos;d love to dine in someday to get the full experience."
4,"I give this place 5 stars for quality of food, but 1 star for its service. The service was incredibly slow and we had to continually flag down down server to order or if we needed anything. The food was very unique and tasty! I wish I would have tried a little of everything on the menu, but the beef and broccoli and potstickers were my favorite! I&apos;d definitely order both of those again. The duck fried rice was just a 2/5 to me. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ve had duck before, so maybe it&apos;s just a taste I haven&apos;t acquired yet. The portions are all on the smaller side, but I felt full after a couple shared plates! There are a couple of vegetarian options also. Great food in one of the best locations!"
5,The Peking duck is supreme! The skin is so crispy and delicious and perfectly cooked! Do not forget to order this and do not forget to call ahead and make sure a duck is reserved for you!
5,"I wasn&apos;t really sure what to expect given that Chinese food is not Stephanie Izard&apos;s original specialty, but I was very impressed. Two standouts were the beef + marrow jiaozi (my favorite thing we had - incredible, smooth and delicious, creamy and rich but not greasy) and the goat noodles (spicy, super thick and delightfully toothsome noodles). My cocktail (frozen watermelon) was also really nice and much better than you&apos;d expect from the name. They also have a very nice outdoor seating setup! Definitely excited to return."
4,"I had two concerns about Duck Duck Goat going in: 1) the food would be not be authentic enough 2) the food would be too expensive without really elevating the dishes they&apos;re inspired from. Luckily I feel like Duck Duck Goat hits a sweet spot of preserving authentic flavors while providing enough of a twist to add novelty. It would have been nice if the prices were a little friendlier, but overall I enjoyed all the dishes I ate at Duck Duck Goat and would definitely visit again. 

My friends and I (a party of 3) got 4 dishes for brunch. It was not entirely filling tbh (they usually recommend 2 dishes/person) but we were getting doughnuts afterwards so it was whatever. 

Duck fried rice (3/5) - A solid fried rice dish (not really used to how &quot;un-clumpy&quot; the fried rice was tho). The waiter told us to break apart the soft boiled egg before eating, but I think it would have been better with the yolk intact. I also feel like it could have used a bit more duck meat. This was my friend&apos;s favorite dish of the meal so maybe this is all personal preference. 

Beef slap noodles (5/5) - my favorite of the night. I loved how chewy the wide noodles were and how creamy the sauce was (it&apos;s basically a pasta). The sauce can be overwhelming after a while without some water, but I would definitely order this again if I came back. 

Duck and goat XLB (3/5) - decent XLB with a fair amount of soup inside. I personally liked the goat flavor, but my friends and I agreed this was the most meh of the dishes we ordered). It&apos;s a nice twist on traditional XLB, but I still think traditional XLB is better.

Jiao Zi (4/5) - the short rib and bone marrow filling of these potstickers has a savory beef flavor that is memorable. Otherwise they&apos;re mostly nicely done potstickers."
5,"I don&apos;t know what took me so long to come back to Duck Duck Goat... but honestly it&apos;s even better than I remember it!

We came here for restaurant week and have absolutely NO regrets. Every dish was so so good and there is PLENTY to go around. 

Some of the dishes we had included Jiaozi, Goat &amp; Duck Spring Roll, Pickled Cucumbers, Grilled Beef &amp; Broccoli, Veggie Fried Rice, Xi&apos;an Goat Slap Noodles, and Mango Coconut Cloud to finish it off. 

To be honest... we had a hard time picking a favorite. Everything is just so incredibly flavorful and the more dishes that come out, the more your jaw drops. Stephanie Izard has done it again. I will continue to be a fan as long as these dishes continue to stay incredible. And so far, they really, really have."
2,Super bummed. Have been waiting a year to try this restaurant and what a fail. Ordered at 4:30 today. The food was supposed to be delivered at 7:15. We received a notification at 6:50 our order was canceled and the restaurant was closed. Turns out the restaurant is open. Ugh.
