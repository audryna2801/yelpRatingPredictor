5,"Old-school diner vibe with totally new takes on classics. Their pie is way better than *that other place* in Logan. I&apos;ve never had something I didn&apos;t like, but my favorites are: 
- Hibiscus key lime pie
- Savory buns--they sell out quick! Go on the early side to catch them 
- Smoked trout biali with giardiniera, mind blowing and maybe one of my top bagel sammys in Chicago 

They&apos;re handling Covid really well. They were letting one at a time inside to order and then pick up at the back door around the corner, but I believe they&apos;ve opened up the inside to a limited number of people in line now that it&apos;s getting cold."
5,I love this place. The bakery items are delicious and their sandwiches are our fi this world. I&apos;m glad they are still open during this pandemic and I will support them as much as possible.
5,"I go here maybe once a month solely for the beet Reuben. Note that I&apos;m not a vegetarian but this sandwich is easily one of the best sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had in my life. When they reopen post quarantine, the Reuben is a must order. Currently, with quarantine, I just started ordered delivery from them. The take and bake cinnamon rolls, cheesecake and gravlax &amp; bialys are all phenomenal. The surprise hit was the tuna salad. Tuna salad can be pretty meh in general but this one had the perfect ratio of tuna to mayo and just enough dill. Can&apos;t wait to get back there when they reopen."
4,"We came here on a Saturday morning and there were only a few people ahead of us. Parking can be tricky but there are some metered spots around. We got the following:

Key lime hibiscus pie: very tart, better when you add the blueberry compote to it
Raspberry pear crumble: my favorite, jam packed with fruit (not overly sweet) with oat crumble on top
Mocha cream: tasty, also liked this one
S&apos;mores: good, but not one of my favorites
Matcha almond tea cake: slices are large but didn&apos;t get much matcha flavor, overly sweet
Spinning J breakfast sandwich: essentially egg and cheese on an English muffin, I agree with a previous reviewer, a glorified McMuffin. Tastes good, but not sure I would spend that much for it
Coffee: good

Service was good but very slow if you order anything hot as you are sent outside to wait while they prepare it. We ordered a simple breakfast sandwich (literally egg and cheese) and ended up waiting about 15 min outside for it to be ready. When I went back inside to see if they had forgotten our order (as there were minimal people behind us on line and they had all left while we were waiting), it looked like they were trying to accumulate as many finished orders as they can on the table before opening the door to pass out completed orders. While I understand they&apos;re trying to limit the number of people inside to be safe, I felt like they should be more thoughtful about the customers waiting outside (especially when it&apos;s 12 degrees outside). They could easily pass out the orders as they are completed...you just have to crack open the door that&apos;s right next to the table and pass the bag.

Their payment set up is also a little awkward. Only the cardreader is in front of the plexiglass so after you insert your card, you can&apos;t choose your tip amount, the server asks you how much you want to tip so she can input it herself. I&apos;m all for supporting restaurants during this time, but tipping should be at your discretion, not a public announcement."
2,"The coffee was delicious, but the service was not friendly. Coronavirus times are hard times, but it doesn&apos;t mean service has to be unfriendly or cold. We are happy to get in and out of your shop so you have more business, but a small bit of &quot;have a nice day&quot; goes a long way. We did not feel welcome."
5,"Randomly came in because we heard someone say there was pie around the corner. It&apos;s a very small place, but it was bustling with people. 

They had about 5 different pies on the board and we went with the blackberry passionfruit pie with meringue and a scoop of vanilla gelato on the side. It was amazing! You could taste both the blackberry and the passionfruit and the meringue was very light and frothy. The gelato was also so good for just being vanilla. I would have licked the plate if it was publicly acceptable. 

So, so, so happy to have stumbled upon this place. Will definitely be back for more!"
5,WITHOUT A DOUBT the best pie in chicago! a consistently amazing and unique menu and second to none service...i have to stop myself from ordering here every day.
5,"We stop into Spinning J at least once a month. It&apos;s such a nice spot. I love their quiches and strata. The fillings vary, but I&apos;m not sure how frequently they change it. Last week, I got a potato, mushroom, and Monterrey Jack quiche and it was great, though it was served super hot. The crust was thin and flaky and there was a caramelized, flavorful, slightly crispy top. My boyfriend likes to mix it up, but usually gets the breakfast sandwich on a biscuit. They have great biscuits and we usually take some home to go! Last week he had the tuna melt and that was really nice. I liked the sourdough bread and dill. We&apos;ve never been disappointed by anything we&apos;ve gotten here.

In terms of logistics, you order at the counter and you can take food to go or you can dine in. Seating is slightly limited for large groups, but ok for groups of 2-4. The atmosphere is really cute- a vintage diner feel. Last week they had a beautiful bouquet of peach-colored roses by the register. I&apos;d highly recommend stopping in and plan to continue to support this lovely business."
5,This is a gem in Humboldt park. I loveee the food and drinks here! I found the menu a bit on the pricier side especially considering where it&apos;s located. I haven&apos;t gotten around to trying their pies but will definitely snag one soon
5,"Charming corner bakery cafe that doesn&apos;t give a fudge about its relatively small footprint because its pies and flaky pastries bring in non-stop wave of customers in the morning. 

It&apos;s been a while since I had to wait in a 2-column line just to get the order in for a breakfast sandwich. It had that great city pulse drumming through the front counter displaying their many baked goods (croissants, quiches, and pies) + their weekly cake flavors proudly displayed on an easel to the side. Yes, we&apos;ve come to the right place. We were a large group so went all the way to the back for a cozy table to squeeze in. On top of the table read a informative (and slightly funny) sign that said to leave when you&apos;re done eating due to small space. Another words, GTFO when done, HAHA! I like their directness - my style totally.

The Spinning J Breakfast Sandwich w/ bacon ($6) - Ordered this because I was hungry and I wasn&apos;t feeling their quiche. Their English muffin was flaky and not too doughy like the ones sold at markets. Pretty solid though it is a bit plain. But it&apos;s very delicious with a cup of latte! 

I&apos;m gonna not review what the rest of my group ate because I don&apos;t remember and I also DGAF (and cuz I gotta GTFO soon). Haha. Joke aside, you just have to go soak up the vibe and see for yourself - this bakery cafe is here to stay and will make many more Chicagoans&apos; mornings that much easier. Go spin.

P.S. Their bathroom is also immaculate and clean so for those morning run after coffee, you&apos;re covered. :)"
5,Unbelievably good pie and cinnamon rolls! Pie also available by the slice if you want a taste of every flavor like we did :)  The inside is adorable and makes you feel like you&apos;re stepping back in time when you enter.
5,I came for the pies and left with pie and other baked goods. I&apos;m not Pieing when I say Spinning J has some of the best in Chicago. My favorite was the key lime Hibiscus followed closely by the Mango cheesecake (I believe that was it). Loved the diner vibe and the staff was on point/very friendly.
5,"We loved everything about this cute dessert place. We all wanted to try a new place in a cozy environment and this placed was perfect.  Most of us ordered pies, tea or coffee.  The s&apos;more pie was great the teenager scarfed it down in  10&apos;seconds. The berry cherry pie has nice and flacky crust with deer and salty taste.  The black tie ish pie was scarfed down by the other teenager. I had the key lime hibiscus pie and it was fantastic.  The graham cracker crust was just right.  Also, the chai team was a winner. The service was this place is  quiet and attentive with a bunch knowledge. I would come back here when in town."
5,"I came here for a pick up pre Christmas.. This place is so cute.. Packed on their only open Monday. Made me wish I lived around the corner.
The saag paneer pot pie was so so good.. The crust just melts in your mouth... I did wish it was just a little bit spicier but over all thought it was amazing.  I loved their hibiscus keylime pie. Just enough tart just enough sweet with the blueberry compote.  My family loved it and I looked like the dessert champion of the world... I can&apos;t wait to try more of this place soon!"
5,"Okay I had to update this review with some must-trys. To be clear, I love this place. It brightens up the whole neighborhood &amp; always smells amazing &amp; feels warm like love. So you have to try the homemade sodas &amp; gelato (they do floats!), the strata (oh my god) or any savory sandwich (I love the tuna melt or beet reuben), &amp; you have to get an oat milk latte &amp; some pie or a pastry. To die for. They do amazing Friday night pizzas. A great date night spot or place to bring friends. I like to go in the afternoon to read the New York Times. Best diner in Chicago hands down, please support!!!"
4,"I saw this place on a Netflix show &apos;Easy&apos; and being kinda close to my apt , I instantly wanted to try it. 

I&apos;m not a coffee connoisseur so not sure how this one ranked but I liked it! The guava cheesecake slice was right up my alley, came with a dollop of fresh whipped cream, yum!.

Hurts to say this but the ice creams were not super great and they seemed to have run out of most flavors that included mango..bummer! Vanilla was way better than my strawberry.

I&apos;ve heard this place gets packed during peak times. I happened to go here during early evening hours on a weekday and there was plenty seating available. 

Super cute ambiance for a date, quiet enough for some deep conversations, interesting pie flavors, free street parking and friendly servers. Whats not to love?

I&apos;ll def come back to try their floats and pot pies."
5,"I stopped at Spinning J to grab a bunch of goodies for my birthday lunch. I got their salami sandwich, strawberry rhubarb soda, biscuit, and 3 slices of pie (to share for dessert that night!). The ciabatta bread on the sandwich was perfect. The s&apos;mores pie was my favorite of the 3. My favorite item was the strawberry rhubarb soda. It was such a pleasant afternoon to grab food then walk down to Humboldt park for a nice socially distanced lunch."
5,"This review is long overdue! They can do no wrong in my book. Every single thing we&apos;ve ordered...they just nail it.  Small menu, executed well. And not in a pretentious way either. 
The scones are perfect. The quiche is next level. Their chai latte is sent from god herself. 
There is a good variety and the menu switches up once in a while, but they keep their staple items available too if you don&apos;t feel like being adventurous. 
I go once a week at least. It ends up a little pricey but worth it, especially now to keep this place open no matter what! 
Definitely a hidden gem in the neighborhood (although not so hidden--there are always a few other people there when I go...Very popular spot.) Must try!"
3,"Spinning J is a small diner that feels very old school. Awesome vibe. I stopped by on a weekend afternoon and had a cup of the daily soup (parsnip and pear) and a maple pecan scone. The soup was an interesting combination of flavors: earthy, savory, and somewhat sweet. The scone was tougher in texture than what I am used to but still decent. I got a blue cheese and herb biscuit to go, but it smelled so wonderful I ended up having it on the train home. So good. So soft, thick, flaky, and herby! My favorite of all the things I tried. I just wish the place was closer to public transportation, although I would come back to try some pie if I&apos;m ever back in the area. 3.5 stars."
4,"I went for pizza Friday where they give you a square piece of pizza, side salad and house made soda for $10! It&apos;s definitely a great deal AND it&apos;s bring your own liquor to mix with their sodas so it&apos;s a great place to pre game!

Everything was pretty tasty but the pizza wasn&apos;t super great.

My friends got the ginger lime soda and I got the lemon drop soda - we all agreed the lemon drop was better.

We also shared the last slice of the matcha almond cake which was sooooo yummy!

Definitely worth checking out but the space is cramped so go earlier than later if you&apos;re dining in!"
