5,"Wonderful date night spot- even during COVID!

Pros:
- Some of the best sushi offered in Chicago.
- Great outdoor seating and ambience with hanging lights and soothing music...an almost perfect ambience if not for the train running by every 5-10 minutes.
- Awesome wait staff: They make great recommendations (patiently explains all the different types of fish) and check on the table often.

What to Get:
- Chef&apos;s Sashimi Selection: 16 pieces of chef&apos;s choice (see picture). Includes tuna and salmon that just melts in your mouth and a smoky mackerel that is to die for!
- Ika Sake: Arrives to the table with a lid on which when taken off, releases a cloud of smoke from burnt herbs. Definitely a showstopper! 2 pieces.

Cons:
- Since it&apos;s outdoor seating, you hear the train go by every 5-10 minutes"
5,"*pre covid review*

This is a review specifically for their classes that they were holding before covid. My bf and I came for the sushi class. We really wanted to do the ramen class but it sold out before we were able to get a spot! 

The class was about an hour and a half long and we basically watched the chef prepare the fish, talk about his background, taste sake, and make our own sushi. It was so fun to be hands on with these amazing quality cuts of fish and to learn many techniques about making sushi rolls and nigiri. We also got to taste their house soy sauce which is incredibly flavorful. 

I really can&apos;t wait for it to be safe for them to hold classes again. Such a great experience!"
5,"I am extremely satisfied with my birthday dinner at Momotaro! I really appreciate the attentive staff and the steps they take to ensure everyone&apos;s health and wellness during the pandemic. This is my second time dining in at Momotaro, and I am still blown away by their dishes. The uni nigiri is the star of the night! It&apos;s extremely fresh and I was very close to ordering seconds! If you are looking for a hot dish, I strongly recommend the lamb chops because they very tender and juicy. The staff was very nice and even offered a birthday treat for me to wrap up the evening. Overall it was an incredible dining experience and I will definitely visit again!"
3,"good but not fantastic...

the high price tags definitely confuse me. beautiful space and definitely perfect for conversation but nothing on the menu (vegetarian or pescatarian) that knocked our socks off."
1,"I&apos;ll try to be fair. I have dined at Momotaro a few times in the past, and have always enjoyed the food. It&apos;s not the best sushi in Chicago (which by itself is not a very high bar), but it&apos;s always been fun. 

Tonight we decided to order for take-out. NEVER AGAIN. So unprofessional. The pickup time was supposed to be 7pm, but I got a call saying that the restaurant was busy and my food would be ready by 7:30p. Ok, not a big deal, I thought. So I showed up at Momotaro at 7:30... and waited... three different people asked about my order; none came back with information (or food!). After 25 minutes spent waiting by the podium (!!!), a fourth hostess asked me to wait in my car---they would call when my food was ready. So I spent the he next 20 minutes (!!!) waiting for a call that did not come. Finally, *I* called them, and somehow, magically, a few minutes later my food was ready. 

Forget about the fact that I was made to wait for 25m in the restaurant (and 20m in the car after that), when the reason I had ordered takeout was to *avoid* spending time indoors. Even in non-covid times, the treatment I endured was so unprofessional, so rude, so inexcusable that I will never, ever eat at Momotaro again, and willl make sure all my friends know about what happened to me. Shameful behavior indeed."
4,Everything was good and very well presented. Nigiri and sushi melted. It was delicious. Avg pp will run you $80-&amp; $150z Well worth it and will definitely be back for more. Servers were patient and courteous. Restaurant practiced good mask wearing and tables were socially distanced. Bathrooms were clean. Recommend this restaurant.
5,"Best nigiri in Chicago! I was desperate to find the restaurant that offers authentic sushi and finally found it! You may think the price is high but you will not regret spending this much once you try Shige-san&apos;s sushi. Anyway, sushi is not every day food. As I grew up in Japan, sushi was what we ate for special occasions. I was very happy with the quality of Shige-san&apos;s omakase sushi. I would definitely go back for my next special occasion. Oh, and zuke salmon oshizushi was very good too!"
5,"Oh my gosh

This is the best restaurant in Chicago. It is a MUST GO TO. The food will expand your taste buds to corners they have never been to. The sushi does not need soy, in fact if you use soy you are ruining it. 

Ask the servers for the must haves. We had Matthew as a server and he was so helpful in showing us food we have truly never experienced before. 

This meal is an experience. Seriously - do it. Worth the money. Let&apos;s go!!! 

Thank you MOMOTARO - you are a gem!!!!!!"
3,"I was excited to try this place as I&apos;ve heard great thing, but I left underwhelmed overall. I ordered the BEEF TSUKUNE &quot;SLIDERS&quot; (very very yummy, our favorite thing we ordered) to start. For sushi, I got the Momomaki and Negi Hamachi (I was particularly disappointed in their signature roll; it was underwhelming). We finished the meal with Chatham (beef fried rice, our second favorite dish). Not rushing to come back."
4,"-service was phenomenal super accommodating and would provide excellent suggestions. A few times we didn&apos;t like the dish and they gladly took it back 
-the oysters were a little to big for my liking, but I prefer smaller size oysters 
- fish was extremely fresh and flavorful 
-the coconut ice cream was my favorite 

Be prepared to have an expensive dinner, but well worth it.

Unfortunately my friend cracked her tooth on a rock in the octopus, but they made us a fresh dish."
5,"I&apos;d eat here everyday if I could. This place makes my top 3 of sushi places in Chicago. 

Scallop motoyaki - this was huge and plentiful for 2 people! The lemon miso in combination with the crispy crust was wonderful and the scallop was fresh and cooked to perfection.

Beef sliders - pretty good, the wagyu was flavorful and wrapped in a soft bao like a hot dog with mustard 

Otoro (fatty bluefin belly) - Amazing! This is melt in your mouth and I have to always order this.

Momomaki roll (signature roll) - we really enjoyed this roll, it&apos;s tuna on top and stuffed with spicy octopus

A5 ebi uni maguro - okay this roll is the showstopper... SO PHENOMENAL. Uni was creamy, ebi shrimp was succulent, A5 had a nice torched/charred flavor and just out of this world. I can&apos;t even begin to explain how damn good the A5 was. This is honestly one of the best rolls I&apos;ve had in my life. ($35/4 pieces is very expensive but worth every penny)

Aji yakusugi - comes out smoking, this was a very interesting one, there&apos;s some type of herb on top that really &quot;awakens&quot; your senses 

Service was great as well, Paul was wonderful and so knowledgeable!"
5,"With +900 reviews and a solid four-star rating under its belt, it&apos;s needless to say Momotaro knows how to please its customers. Our experience did not stray away. It was exceptional thanks to the attentive service, lively ambiance, and overwhelmingly excellent food.

Some of our favorite items:
1) Yakiniku is a tasting of A5 strip, Mishima strip, and gyutan cooked tableside. I highly recommend ordering this and using a timer so you won&apos;t overcook the meat.
2) Hokkaido octopus sashimi
3) Robata with bone-in lamb
4) Aburi beni toro sushi with salmon belly, karashi miso, battera konbu
5) Otoro nigiri with fatty bluefin belly
6) Budo to Pinattus with brown butter mochi, concord sherbet, dulcey whip and pearls, candied peants, and grape gelee

None-food related comments/thoughts... 
1) The fact the bathrooms are individualized and unisex is a major plus. However, it will be very helpful with some sort of indicator on whether the bathroom is occupied rather than turning each and every door knob until you come across a vacant one.
2) For a fancy restaurant, their use of disposable, wooden, and splintery chopsticks baffles me."
3,"I waited forever to try momotaro. They were closed for a long time since they didn&apos;t have outdoor seating. Anyway, I was fairly disappointed at the food and service.   When going to hyped up restaurants, I always like to ask the waitress about the best items on the menu. Our reservation was a the end of the night, so maybe that is why the waitress wasn&apos;t interested in giving recommendations, but still would have liked to have had some direction. The food was subpar (maybe we didn&apos;t get the best choices.. again because we didn&apos;t have any help from the waitress.) The dessert was by far my favorite thing."
4,"I really liked it here. Make sure you make a reservation. Came here with my best friend for dinner. Since we had a reservation, we pretty much walked right on in. &amp;&amp; the place was packed... even with a pretty early dinner. 
Mood lighting in the space makes for a great date night; not to mention the ambiance was ideal. 
We sat and were quickly greeted. we both ordered drinks and started catching up. The server didn&apos;t seem like he was rushing us since we hadn&apos;t quite looked at the menu for our food orders.  
Our drinks were pretty strong, but delicious. 
We both ordered two rolls. 
I think I got the Kumamoto beef to hotate and the kani jomaki. They were both delicious!
What a great experience. I would definitely recommend my friends come here."
2,"After being seated our server, Lauren went over the menu. We told her we&apos;ve never been here before and I asked why there wasn&apos;t ramen on the menu. That&apos;s why we came here. We mistakenly went to Momotaro not realizing they had another restaurant downstairs for ramen at Izakaya.

That&apos;s when she rolled her eyes and explained that&apos;s downstairs and if we wanted ramen we couldn&apos;t be seated here. Despite her attitude I said I&apos;m willing to try both restaurants. She agreed and said yes try both! We figured why not try Momotaro&apos;s appetizers before heading downstairs.

The dishes we ordered were great! However, when we went downstairs the hostess told us their kitchen just closed. Why didn&apos;t our server just tell us to just head downstairs when we told her we came here for the ramen? Guess she only cared if she got tipped. Disappointed and hungry... we left to find another place for ramen. Luckily there was another place within a block."
5,"This is one of the few restaurants in Chicago that I have been to multiple times, and would still come back for more. Their menu is not huge but there are a lot of different options and it changes with the seasons. My favorite time visiting was for their New Year&apos;s Eve dinner, probably my best NYE yet. Very well organized, good food, party hats :) my favorite dish is the king crab dish, that you eat out of the shell, but I&apos;m a little concerned because the last time I went it wasn&apos;t on the menu, so hopefully it comes back. The interior also adds to the experience. Well designed and a lot to look at. Great for date night!"
5,"Came for a girls night dinner and loved our meal! Must try dishes were the tender and juicy beef sliders (served like a hotdog), chahan (huge portion of crispy fried rice enough for 2-3 people), flavorful lamb chops, and the mapo tofu (served bubbling in a skillet with just the right kick of spices). Will definitely be back!"
5,"Came here with my girlfriend for her birthday. Have been wanting to go here for a while and it didn&apos;t disappoint. We got the spaghetti, waygu buns, and the chicken and rice with an egg. For dinner we got multiple sushi rolls (can&apos;t remember the names). It was excellent and one of the best sushi rolls I&apos;ve had in the city. Well done and will recommend to anyone in the city."
5,"There&apos;s a reason I keep coming back to you Momotaro! Hard to believe that 3 years ago we were daring to bring our baby and now had no qualms (ok maybe a little) of bringing back our now almost 5 year old and almost 20 month old to meet up with my niece who was in town for the NBA All-Star game was staying across the street at the Hoxton.

Needless to say, we were seated at a booth with lots of room and preferable to a regular table. Kids were well behaved and ate everything we ordered except the nigiri. Our server was so awesome and interacted with the kids which I really appreciated. Friendly with great food/drink reds and gave us time to settle in and make decisions. The Chef&apos;s Nigiri Flight is still my hands down favorite. Eight pieces for $59 so worth it. The adults had their own flights and we shared a few hot/cold dishes like the standard edamame, Tofu, along with the Spaghetti sans spice which the kids adored, the Yakitori Don which was so flavorful and delicious. Also tacked in chicken thigh and the lamb from the robata halo per our server&apos;s recs although he did say there was already chicken thigh in the rice but we wanted to double down on the thighs. Drinks were stiff and the desserts were delicious. Plus for impressing my young niece and tricked her into thinking I was still hip and could still hang out with kids in tow."
2,"I was recently let down by the Boka restaurant group. They recently made the decision to suspend all in person dining(including outdoor). I have no issue with that decision, but they confirmed my reservation yesterday (12/4). when I called to inquire about the valet, the automated message informed me that they were no longer seating any parties indoor or out. This dinner was for an important birthday celebration. I was very much looking forward to treating my girlfriend to her favorite sushi to cheer her up on a birthday that couldn&apos;t be celebrated like normal. As stated, I have no issue with the decision to end dining. I am just disappointed in how the cancellation was handled."
