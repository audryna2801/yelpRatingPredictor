5,"We came here on a whim while working one day. I&apos;d heard the sandwiches were really good and have been meaning to try them for the longest time. I have really been missing out!!! Unreal food at this hidden gem. 

I got the Italian Sub and was VERY happy with It. Bread was soft, perfect amount of meat, vegetables were fresh and seasoning was great. The prices were fair and the employees were friendly. I believe they do call ahead orders, not sure on delivery. I would highly suggest going to get a sub sandwich from this spot. You&apos;ll leave happy, full and smiling."
5,"First time ever trying Bari, and I&apos;ll have to say every sandwich was excellent. The focaccia American is so huge and amazing. The Italian was probably the best I&apos;ve ever had, and the meatball was devoured within seconds of arrival. Delivery was fantastic and packaged well. A+"
5,"Great place to pick up an incredibly tasty sub on the go. They use fresh ingredients, and I think very freshly baked bread. The staff is really friendly. If you&apos;re there often they&apos;ll know your name and get to know you. This place is run by some wonderful people. I couldn&apos;t recommend this business more."
5,"It&apos;s all been said in other reviews. And it&apos;s all true. Bari is awesome. I&apos;ve been coming for years. It remains one of my favorite Chicago gems. You won&apos;t be disappointed.

For any vegetarians out there, the Italian Veggie is a delicious go to sub."
4,"Solid Italians subs.  Line moved super fast for how busy they were. We&apos;d recommend calling in for faster pickup. That said, the service folks were nice.

This would have been a 5 out of 5 but honestly street parking was rough. My husband had to wait in the car while I went in alone so he could sit in a red zone for me to come back out."
5,"my friend toll me about this place
I try them today
Italian sub spicy  9  inches 
really good I be back for something else they also got great selection of pastas and more Italian great stuff"
4,Bari subs has delicious sandwiches. The bread is the hard flaky kind. I prefer softer bread. Fresh ingredients and delivery was one time. Highly recommend if you&apos;re downtown Chicago.
2,"I have a THING for real Italian delis. Used to go to one (Claro&apos;s, legit) almost weekly for about 5 years living in Orange County, CA. And on our last visit to NYC, Faicco&apos;s, a locally well-respected Italian market, was literally my favorite &quot;restaurant&quot; of our entire week there - so much so we made the effort to visit three separate times just to keep trying things. I love good deli sandwiches so so much. SO MUCH. And given the vibe of this one and the fact that it felt like a lot of locals like to eat there, I had high hopes.

But man, this was really disappointing. The Italian had so little meat, cheese, or any semblance of flavor. The meatball sub was utterly lackluster, with tasteless meatballs and shockingly bland sauce (and very little of it). Italian sausage sub was better if only because the house sausage itself was good, but again, very bland sauce. No punch. No sweetness. I also bought a spinach arancini to eat later and it was suuuuper dry and crumbly. That is not how arancini should be. 

The staff was really nice and prices were okay. But I was truly hoping to get something very &quot;Chicago&quot; on this trip through the city (I am here a couple of times per year) and I thought Bari would fit the bill, as an &quot;authentic Chicago deli,&quot; and it didn&apos;t come anywhere close. Sadness."
5,My first trip to Chicago had to include a hot beef sandwich wet right? It&apos;s an iconic dish in the chi. I spent a lot of time looking for the &quot;Best&quot; beef in the city and I was led here. A hole in the wall market with a beautiful deli in the back that serves up what I can now say the best beef sandwich I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s so juicy and tender it absolutely melted in my mouth. I added the xtra hot giardiniera I highly recommend not getting it extra hot unless you are a SERIOUS hot head it was pure fuego!!!!  Average consumer stick to the standard. I can&apos;t to come back. I love Chicago...
5,"This is my favorite sandwich shop in all of Chicago for a traditional hot fire sandwich. The prices are reasonable and the meat is fresh. It&apos;s a little bodega type experience and in the back they have a full deli. You can get some chips and some groceries too while you&apos;re at it. Even when there&apos;s a line I&apos;m in and out of the store. 
There&apos;s really nothing else to say other than go , you won&apos;t regret it ."
5,"This is by far the best Italian deli in the city. 
when I really like a guy or want to do something special for one of my friends I get subs from here and bring them to my buddies or boyfriend. Meat is always really fresh as is the bread. you won&apos;t be disappointed"
5,"I liked this tiny cute Italian spot at least I bought some stuff there and I tried their sub. They make them very fast and they are tasty still, very cool. This one surely can be defined as a hidden gem. If you&apos;re a lover of Italian food and stuff to make it by yourself I really advise you to stock up there. Support local and get right things!"
1,"I have passed by this place many times and always wanted to stop. I have heard of Bari and people having a good &quot;experience &quot; here. Finally today,  I decided to drive all the way here from the northwest suburbs to get my family some subs. 

I walked in and there was a line with maybe 8 people for the deli. As I got to the front some you g short Latino looking man yelled at me &quot; NEXT!&quot; I said, &quot; yes, id like to order a few sandwiches starting with 3 meatball sandwiches&quot;. He went behind the counter &quot; YOU WANT CHEESE?&quot; he screamed at me and I said &quot;yes please&quot;. Then another man comes and tells the guy behind me to step up and asks for his order. The guy finishes my sandwiches and hands them to me &quot;here ya go&quot;. I said,&quot;ok and for my other sandwiches...&quot; he cuts me off. &quot; No more sandwiches. No more bread.&quot; I said &quot;what do you mean, no more bread?&quot; I couldn&apos;t fathom how a sandwich shop (that looks to be extremely popular) could be out of bread by noon on a Sunday. He said &quot; you can&apos;t get anything else, I have NO more bread, no sandwiches, NOTHING &quot;. I was pissed. I have come all the way down here, now HALF my family gets to eat. I had TOLD him I wanted more sandwiches and he didn&apos;t ask me how many KNOWING they were taking more orders. The guy BEHIND me got a few sandwiches which should have gone to me because I was in front of him. He was so rude about it also. I walked to the front and checked out . I went to the car and told my husband what had happened and he actually didn&apos;t believe me. So he went inside. He stood inline for almost 10 minutes, as the line wasn&apos;t moving until the guy from the back screamed at the girl checking people out to let them know there was no more bread. 

This place has horrible customer service. Over priced sandwiches. My kid split his sandwich with his sibling, took a couple bite and then confessed that it was awful. Ill post a pic of what he left behind. 

I&apos;ll never go here again. Maybe the sandwich shop right next door has some clue how to treat people...or any other sandwich shop in Chicago. Never.again."
5,I&apos;ve had a few meatball subs in Chicago but this is by far the best! We also ordered the focaccia Italian style with turkey. Oh my goodness this is a large sandwich and it was fantastic! Both sandwiches fed me and my husband for lunch and dinner.
4,Ordered subs for a picnic at a park on one of the warmer days this fall. They were delicious and affordable and ready for pick up on time. Will go back!
5,Just amazing sandwiches and sausage. The barese sausage is great for barbecuing.  Place is awesome!!!
4,Solid sub sandwiches!! Friend recommended I try this deli and sub shop. They were churning and burning in there. They made the subs fast which was impressive! There was a line but went super quick! I tried the Italian sub and Tuna Sub. Prices were good! You can get a 3 foot sub also! Wow!!
5,"Bari is awesome, one of my favorite places in the neighborhood. The sandwiches are delicious--good quality meats and cheeses, delicious bread, dressed perfectly, and very generous quantity. 

The groceries selection is also good. I *love* their homemade ricotta, it&apos;s phenomenal."
5,The perfect sub.  Highly recommended.  Worth the trip if you don&apos;t live nearby.
1,"So this place can&apos;t hot a delivery time. Would strongly recommend avoiding. Placed order at 1115. Expected delivery 1209-1229. Called at 1230 saying would be 20 more minutes late. Food didn&apos;t arrive until after 1. And they close at 2 anyway. What a joke. Really a colossal disaster and would recommend avoiding.

Food was delicious for whatever that&apos;s worth. But it ruined our plans for the day so make your own decisions if it&apos;s worth it.

(I finally did it. Wrote a bad review based on the service. But when it&apos;s a delivery place and you&apos;re basing your day on it NOT taking two hours, I guess that&apos;s the straw man)

All this said probably would give a second chance someday maybe and will update."
