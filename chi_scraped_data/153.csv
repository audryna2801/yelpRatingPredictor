5,"Hidden gem! There aren&apos;t many Mediterranean places around Lincoln Square and I&apos;m a huge falafel head, so I was thrilled to find this place. We ordered the falafel (yum), chicken kabob (delish, not dry at all) and ground sirloin kabob (friggin amazing). The kabobs came with a grilled tomato, green pepper and quarter onion, plus a little cucumber salad and a nice big flakey pita. Also got a side of dill rice which was bomb. Ordered this for pick-up and it was ready early and piping hot. Will be back!!"
5,"Just received our family platter that we ordered online through they&apos;re restaurant. The delivery was 25 minutes ahead of time, the delivery man was very nice, and the food was extremely delicious! Everything was on point! We really did have an amazing feast! I can&apos;t believe you guys have been open since 1999! And I remember when it was originally the building next to the Lebanese market right next to brown line station. I used to get off the train and I would smell the aroma of the kabobs in the air - it was mouthwatering!"
5,"So good. Great hummus and huge portions. Good classics like kebabs but also delicious traditional dishes like fesenjan and ash reshteh. Since COVID, they&apos;ve done well by opening all their large windows and making the space patio-like."
5,"One of the best restaurants in Chicago. Amazing food, amazing service! I just wish they opened one downtown because it&apos;s so far... but definitely worth the drive. 

The owner, the servers, everyone there is just delightful. 
They also have the best  !"
5,"I love this restaurant and their staff.  (Elias
Always makes
Me any my family fee like home) If you want a delicious, feels like a home made meal... this is your place. It&apos;s amazing and consistent.  Highly recommended."
5,"Definitely one of the top Persian restaurants in Chicago, if not the best for sure! I had the opportunity to get food here often since it is a neighborhood staple of Albany Park and North Park. Their Koubideh kabab Platter, which is their signature ground sirloin, is amazing and my favorite thing on their menu. It is so much food, and it is definitely good for 2 meals imo! The rice is perfect and their pita bread abd hummus is so yummy. It is definitely a must try when you are in the area.

If you get the opportunity to dine in, do so. It has a beautiful formal dine in area. Amazingly decorated. Friendly service as well."
3,"I can&apos;t help but compare Noon O to Kabobi Grill..It&apos;s hard not to when they are literally just down the street from one another and both are known for great Persian.

We finally tried Noon O take-out (after having Kabobi a few times) and while the kebabs were flavorful &amp; tender; chenjeh, salmon &amp; koubideh...most of our apps and sides were a huge miss/mess.

Another thing - they don&apos;t include rice with entrees (unlike Kabobi) and they really skimp on the pita (smallish too - also unlike Kabobi). Call me anal, but I notice these things. AND...the biggest turn off of all - they prepare their dill rice with cilantro!  Ok, granted I&apos;m not a fan of cilantro, but that&apos;s not the point.  Traditionally (and at any Persian or Middle Eastern restaurant that serves dill rice) it is made only with fresh dill and lima beans. Cilantro completely changes the flavor of the rice. In fact, they shouldn&apos;t call this Dill rice at all.  No where on the menu does it mention this.  I get it&apos;s their &apos;version&apos; but what a let down. I&apos;ll never order it from here again (and that&apos;s part of my reason for getting Persian food in the 1st place).

Aash Reshteh soup was horrible and I&apos;m not exaggerating. There was no flavor to this soup! Completely and horrifyingly bland. They should&apos;ve thrown this batch in the garbage.  I&apos;ve had this at Kabobi and it was night and day...so amazing there..I couldn&apos;t even taste yogurt (which is customary in this soup). We ended up tossing.  Borani is another favorite of mine (sauteed spinach with onion &amp; garlic mixed with yogurt).  Great as a dip or to compliment your kebobs.  There was no effort in this preparation.  They just threw some cooked spinach in yogurt and called it a day (or Borani). Edible, but not enjoyable. Falafel tasted very mediocre.  Tadig was ok.

We enjoyed the Caspian eggplant; flavorful with chunks of eggplant. Hey, one outta five not bad! (sarcasm).  I also think they&apos;re pricier than Kabobi.  3 stars cause the kebabs were great and service was fine.  Might try them again, but why would I when Kabobi has never let me down? Sorry Noon O...not sorry.  Outdoor dining looks nice though."
4,"I&apos;ve been eating Persian food from Miami to DC and now Chicago.  This is a special place that has great food quality and a nice dining experience: You can either dine in as casual or full service sit down. 

Highly recommend."
4,"My family was recommended this place with very high regard and we were not disappointed! We got the family meal for 4 people and everyone enjoyed it. The meats were definitely the highlight of the entire meal. The beef and chicken were seasoned to perfection and were incredibly soft. The beef towards the bottom of the platter was undercooked and too chewy so that was slightly disappointing. The pita they gave us was disappointing because it was store-bought rather than homemade and it wasn&apos;t good. It was hard and stale with bland flavors. Overall, I would suggest you just order the meat by itself rather than a family meal."
4,"In a recent visit to Chicago, my group I traveled with were Iranian and we wanted to eat Iranian food while visiting. 

While looking at reviews, it was so difficult to not want to come here with its outstanding rating and quantity of reviews. 

We knew the Uber would be a bit more to travel from downtown but we didn&apos;t care.

The menu was extensive and was really flexible when it came to making a more custom meal. If you aren&apos;t familiar with the portions of Iranian food, it&apos;s on the larger end. But luckily, here they had options for how many skewers or sizes you could order to make it more &quot;individual&quot; portion size. 

Although our Arizona local Persian restaurant remains our favorite, we were greatly impressed with the service and food."
5,"This place has been on my list for awhile so was excited to finally try it out yesterday. We went at lunch time which was perfect because they have an AMAZING lunch deal - $7.95 for chicken and super tender beef kebab, a ton of rice and salad. 
We did the &quot;half and half&quot; option on the rice which combines their dill rice with their regular rice so we could try both. The rice is so perfectly cooked - fluffy and flavorful and they give you this little cup of lamb stew that I LOVED so much I had to ask for more to pour all over my rice. 
Since I didn&apos;t know how big the lunch special was we also ordered the trio dip to start so we could try their hummus, baba Ghannouj and kash-ke-bademjan (which is also an eggplant based dip that I had never had before). All 3 were good and served with warm pita. Go here if you can, especially during their lunch specials (weekdays from 11-3pm). 

Only negative was the parking lot which only has 1 opening which is the entrance and exit and if the lot is full (which seems to always be the case since this place is popular) it&apos;s annoying to turn around and get back out. But this is minor."
5,"This is my one the favorite places to eat, good spot to come with family or friends. Delicious varieties of meat."
4,"There is plenty of variety in menu options, seating, and meal size. The kabob was delicious and the price was fair for Persian food- but the quality is not outstanding. The musir was heavy on the yogurt and light on the musir itself. The lamb kabob was flavorful and delicious while the chicken kabob was much more bland and wanting for more. 
The salads only came with plain vinegar and did not have the flavor you expect from a Persian house salad. Overall, it satisfied the authentic Persian food craving but definitely leaves you wanting more flavor and balance between flavors. 

The seating can range from casual takeout style to their lovely dining room adorned with tile murals and a chandelier. It is a great place for groups and the game changer for 3 vs 4 stars is their ability to bring such s large parties and have shareable plates."
5,"The service is nice, the food delicious. What I especially appreciate is the cost is very reasonable. There is the more elegant dinning room which I haven&apos;t been in. There is more of a diner section which is where I go as it is BYOB and very reasonable for the delicious food."
5,"I&apos;ve been to Noon O Kabob in Niles many years ago, but most recently went to the Chicago location on Kedzie last Tuesday. Mediterranean is almost always a treat for me and one of my favorite cuisines no matter where I go, and NOK is no exception.

My girlfriend and I went for lunch around 12:30 or so, so they had a lunch special for about $8 after tax. My goodness, this special was LIFE. Came with plenty of rice, a salad, chicken, steak, a falafel, half a grilled tomato and some sauce. It was a hefty meal for only $8; such a great value. My only complaint was that there was a LOT of rice but not enough meat; I would have liked to have a little less rice and a little more meat to balance it out a bit. The chicken was great but the steak was where it was at. It was SO juicy and flavorful; I&apos;ve never tasted mediterranean style steak like this before. When I come back again, I&apos;m definitely getting extra steak.

My girlfriend and I both had the Persian ice cream for dessert. It was kind of like a combination between a straight sorbet and conventional milky ice cream. I got the strawberry for myself and the saffron for my girlfriend... but I thought the saffron was originally mango! I didn&apos;t read at all, I just assumed from the color. My girlfriend&apos;s favorite ice cream flavor is mango, but she went ahead and tried the saffron and liked it. I tried it myself; the saffron is definitely very pronounced and gets even moreso the deeper you get in the cup. It was good, but wasn&apos;t for me. The strawberry on the other hand was so delicious and I would definitely get again and again. The ice cream cups are a little expensive at about $5 apiece but I would say it&apos;s worth it. If they were $4 apiece though, I feel like that&apos;d be a super fair price no matter who you ask.

As for the restaurant itself, it&apos;s a huge place with a regular dine-in section and then a &quot;banquet hall&quot; of sorts that&apos;s meant for reservations and fancier get togethers. The building is very aesthetically pleasing and clean. The staff was friendly and the servers coming around bussing tables were also very helpful and responsive.

All in all, Noon O Kabob is definitely one of my favorite mediterranean spots. Can&apos;t wait to come again and try more of the menu, but the lunch special is such a great value, it&apos;ll be hard to deviate from that!"
5,"I have been a patron since Naheed from Cook County Hospital  several years ago, treated me to lunch here at the end of my rotation.  While I understand that these are difficult times for everyone.... I am grateful for the care that went into packing and preparing my delicious order. THANK YOU.   (Pita bread,Pomegranate Mushrooms,Shrimp + Joujeh combo w/dill rice.  Baba Ghannouj  along with a serving of cilantro, parsley, onions and radish in the back )"
4,"This is an interesting restaurant that&apos;s got a self service area at the front and then a bigger, nicer room where it&apos;s sit down.

My cousin and sister and I got mint tea. Yum! It was soothing to drink with the cubes of sugar.

With the rest of my family, we ordered things to share. We first got pita with a plate of cilantro, feta, and onions. 

Then we got a plate of different sauces: hummus, 2 types of eggplant mixtures (one looked like baba ganoush), tzaziki, and a mixture of onions, tomatoes, and cucumber. The hummus was not my favorite. Couldn&apos;t figure out why it was just alright.

We also got a plate of grilled meats: chicken, beef, and lamb. Not bad! It was so much food! We couldn&apos;t finish!

Along with the huge plate of rice, we were all stuffed.

Staff here is amazing! They&apos;re aware of when you need more pita, taking plates, etc.

The space is large and it&apos;s a good place to go for families or with a date.

It can get loud in here though. We could hear the laughter of guests from across the room. I think it&apos;s how the sound carries, but it was almost distracting. The ceiling is concave which probably caused the sound waves to bounce across the whole room.

The bigger room was beautiful though. The blue lighting set the mood. With all the windows, you get a nice view of the outdoors.

They have their own parking lot, but it&apos;s not hard to find parking around here depending on what time you arrive."
5,"This restaurant was amazing. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by the owner Mir and he was nice enough to offer me a glass of wine and engaged with me while I waited for my party to arrive. Then when we were seated our waitress, Anastazija was great. She chatted with us, made us laugh, was very sweet and provided excellent customer service. She and the rest of the crew at the restaurant were very accommodating. The food was amazing as always. I highly recommend Noon O Kabob and I will definitely be back."
4,Very tasty and reasonably priced. Take home some baba ghannouj! Easy pick up with parking!
3,"Interior of this restaurant is absolutely beautiful with the overhead statement chandelier in the main room and floor to ceiling windows of the main room. The interior is also filled with beautiful artwork and a variety of turkish lamps which really give this place an authentic feel! While my experiences with Persian food are very very limited, I found that the overall food flavor was a little lacking in flavor. The dill rice had a heavy hand of butter on it and the variety of meats didn&apos;t have much spices in it. I&apos;m unsure if this is how typical persian food is flavored, but compared to some other kebabs I&apos;ve had (Afghani, Pakistani/Indian, Turkish) these paled in comparison and were bland. They do include sumac at the table, feta cheese, olives, and sliced red tomatoes to go with the dish which helped some, but I missed having more spices and deeper flavor profile for my meal. On the pro side, servings are massive here. I came hungry and still had half of my meal boxed up! Prices reflect the large portions so it&apos;s a great place to share several dishes with friends/family for a fun dining experience! 

Also another pro: they have a parking lot for customers! WIN!"
