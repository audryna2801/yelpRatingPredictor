5,"Review for delivery food:

Burger absolutely delicious. Beef was pink. Messy but not difficult to hold. Only component I would comment on was the egg was overcooked, not runny.

Fries were crispy and soft. Banana chocolate shake was on point. Not too thick although it&apos;s expected to melt a little when you&apos;re waiting for delivery.

I really enjoyed my food and will order from this place again!"
5,"Experience: This review was during the Covid and Shelter in Place situation. With that said, I was only able to order take-out and pick the food up at their located business. 

Parking: They have a free parking lot that is located in the back! If that is full, it appears that there is also street parking. Not sure if it is paid or free. Just ensure that you observe any street signs prior to parking. 

Worth: I am definitely coming back here again if I wanted something quick and greasy. They also have an outside patio that I want to eat at once this shelter in place is done with. Seems to be a great place to hang out and enjoy the weather if it permits. I had their double fatso cheeseburger (As pictured below) and let me tell you, it was huge! You get that with fries, you might be done eating for the rest of the day. Also, if you do end up ordering a hotdog, you get fries included! So no need to ordering a set of fries."
5,"The burgers here are always delicious, as well as my personal favorite, their shrimp! (drool). Food is always tasty and conveniently ready at the time quoted at time of order. On top of that, I always feel safe when I stop in. If anyone isn&apos;t wearing a mask, they actually enforce the rules. That goes for people wearing them below their nose. That makes me feel confident in eating here as I am immunocompromised. Thank your for keeping our community safe and providing us with delicious food :)"
5,"Definition of dive found @ Merriam-Webster:

Dive - a shabby and disreputable establishment (such as a bar or nightclub)

Shabby? Yes, indeed! Disreputable? Hardly! How could they be when serving some of the best food this city has to offer???

Worth leaving the &apos;burbs for, that&apos;s for sure. So go &apos;head and treat yourself to a cheddar burger or an authentic Chicago style hot dog. You won&apos;t be disappointed. The burger is melt in your mouth, deliciousness! You can&apos;t go wrong with either the Char Grilled or Smashed. The fries are excellent, too. 

I plan on going back to try the fried shrimp everybody keeps raving about..."
4,"A great choice for getting pickup or delivery for burgers and fries. We like their chili, too, which is chock full of meat (which would explain why it&apos;s a little pricey -- you get what you pay for).

Recommended when you need a guilty pleasure and don&apos;t want the fancy gourmet frou-frou burger etc. Very tasty."
4,"Dirty and delicious!
Double dog, vanilla shake and oozy burger  - all great! 
The fries that come w the dog are enough to share between two for sure.
Shake was great - not too thick but still indulgent.
It isn&apos;t elevated, fancy, or gourmet but it is tasty and does exactly what you want."
5,"Best greasy fast food junk I&apos;ve ever had. and milkshakes. That&apos;s all you really have to know about Fatso&apos;s. Don&apos;t go here for good customer service, just ignore that and enjoy the wonders of their amazing burgers and shakes."
5,"So after eating here the first time I have decided this is one of the must visit spots when in Chicago.  There are plenty of great places to eat throughout the city and surrounding areas so saying that is giving major props to their food.  The portions are huge and hearty fitting the local Chicago flare.  You will find the standard Chicago dogs, Maxwell Street Polish, and such.  If you cannot make up your mind you can do a combo of your faves like I did.  I went with an Italian beef and Italian sausage sandwich.  There was no complaining of where is the meat or it being too much bread.  The cooks must have been playing a game called hide the bread with tasty goodness.  I actually looked under the beef to make sure that the sausage was there.  It was and a good combination but it&apos;s one of those situations you start to get curious as to how to how their other offerings taste.  Hoping to get that chance soon."
4,"Great burger joint and some! 

I had the beyond burger, milkshake and Mac n cheese and fries. Everything was just what you&apos;d expect from a burger joint. 

The burger was done just right and the shake was creamy rich and smooth. 

This place gets great reviews and I see why. They do simple just right. For every fast food craving Fatso knows what you need!"
4,"Alright, I&apos;ll come right out of the gate explaining why 4 stars and not 5 stars: soggy fries. But give the rest of Fatso&apos;s a chance! 

It&apos;s one of my comfort food places that I love to order from for pickup. Whether its a juicy burger (with Fatso&apos;s sauce, a must!) or cheesy tater tots (*chefs kiss*) it&apos;s warm and comforting from beginning to end. It&apos;s perfect summer food with burgers, fries, hot dogs, or perfect winter food with mac n cheese, or cheesy tots. You can&apos;t go wrong, year round. 

I usually order a Double Fatso with Cheese (Please), and it&apos;s in my personal top 5 favorite burgers in the city. I&apos;ve even had their fried shrimp po&apos; boy and you&apos;re probably like why would anyone order a shrimp po&apos; boy in the midwest, the middle of the country, where shrimp cannot be found for hundreds of miles? Well I don&apos;t think about it too hard and I simply enjoy that delicious sandwich that they make. 

No pics because I always finish my meal before I get a chance to snap a pic."
5,Finally a delicious burger spot! This place was great for burgers and shakes. I loved the portion size of the burger. Just right and the shakes made with real strawberries. Fries were okay. A Lil over priced but definite good food.
5,"Yummmmm!! The boyfriend woke up with a taste for an Italian beef and I was in the city running errands so I wasn&apos;t close to my go-to spots (Johnny&apos;s or Portillo&apos;s). I&apos;ve driven past this place so many times and have always wanted to check them out. 

I got an Italian beef, dipped with sweet &amp; hot peppers. It comes with fries for $9. I thought the beef had a really nice flavor - kinda salty, which I like! The sweet peppers were different as there were red bell peppers - tasty! And you can&apos;t go wrong with hand cut fries...

My friend got the cheesy tator tots that come with Fatso sauce. Those were really good to! Kinda of reminded me of a hush puppy, but better!

Next time I&apos;m going to have to try a burger. This guy was eating his outside while I was waiting and I couldn&apos;t stop staring, it got awkward!"
5,"This is some down and dirty great comfort food. No frills here - you order at a counter, they call your number and you sit on a dirty picnic bench outside. The food though - drool worthy. You have to get the ooey gooey if you go and highly recommend a side of the Mac and cheese. You will not feel proud of yourself for eating it but man is it tasty!"
5,"Super casual spot. The burgers here are magnificent.  My beef was pin, just like I love it.  I had mine with an egg and it was just awesome.  The french fries were hot and crispy.

There&apos;s free parking in the back of the restaurants o that&apos;s a big plus instead of having to drive around the block looking for parking."
1,"Been here a few times, keep hearing people raving about the basic
egg on a basic burger. The place is basic. And prices are a ripoff. And oh yeah cash only. The workers are rude saw a worker berating a customer over a to go bag"
3,"Been here a few times and it&apos;s pretty good.  The problem is the only way the hot dogs come is WITH FRIES... for $5 each.  We ordered 4 dogs and a couple drinks for $25?? We ended up throwing away like 4 orders of fries, come on who eats this many french fries!?  Overall, good dogs but they need to figure out their pricing structure because it&apos;s just too many fries and too expensive!  Come on it&apos;s hot dogs for christsakes.. talk later"
1,Just left this place. Came home and no bacon OR a cheese on my burger. So disappointing since me and my husband paid an arm and a leg just for burgers alone without any fries and additional for cheese and bacon. We were so excited to eat here and this place is expensive. Me being a trusting customer I didn&apos;t check before we got home and I should&apos;ve. Check your orders people especially for the price your paying for this place!
5,I wish I would&apos;ve taken pictures. My wife wanted a hotdog and we stop by and it was the best chard dog we&apos;ve had in a very long time.
4,"I became familiar with Fatso&apos;s by watching a feature on one of the shows on Food Network. Located in Lincoln Park it is a small dive with limited parking and what appears to be no restroom inside of the building but somewhere outside.

A lot of locals visit this place. A lot of moving parts when you walk in so if you don&apos;t know what you want or what&apos;s going on, grab a menu and step to the side until you&apos;re ready to place your order.
I went with the Maxwell Street polish and fries combo and it was delish. My only gripe were the &quot;shorty&quot; fries that came with the order. None of my fries were longer than my pinky finger and it made it seem like I had a basket of leftover runt fries.

Limited seating inside and many people get their order to go. Orders did&apos;t seem to take that long to be prepared and I did&apos;t hear any complaints either. There is an ATM on the premises if you&apos;re low on cash. They do accept cards but their POS register is too old for contactless pay methods.

I would recommend and definitely visit again when in the area. Make sure you get your picture on the side of the building with the mural painted wings to commemorate your visit."
5,My fav is the shrimp!! You have to try it if you haven&apos;t it&apos;s sooo good especially with their special sauce?l!!
