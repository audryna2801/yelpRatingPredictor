5,"Got the Beijing duck dinner for takeout on Chinese New Year - it&apos;s as great as everyone says! I do wish it came with crepes instead of just a few baos, but the duck itself was delicious. I do think a little bit of crispiness was lost in transport, but that&apos;s to be expected. It comes with more than enough vegetables for the six baos. 

I also ordered the honey roasted pork which was pretty good! Not the most tender, but pretty delicious. 

Overall, they were very busy, even for pick up. Make sure you call ahead! Their system is fairly efficient."
5,"Being a December baby during covid isn&apos;t very fun, but my partner and I wanted to do something special. 

I have had Peking / Beijing duck once before, but for my birthday meal I decided on a Beijing duck from Sun Wah. Having done some research I opted for the duck noodles instead of the duck fried rice, and placed an order for extra buns / bao. 

The ordering process was smooth, I called the order in to be picked up later in the day and it was ready right on time. Covid procedures were followed inside of the restaurant and the pick up line moved quickly. 

The meal was packaged professionally and traveled well. 

Onto the food:

Beijing duck - loved it. Some of the texture is lost during transit but the flavors were still there and the skin still had a crunch to it. Some pieces (less than 5%) seemed charred, which might bother some people but I like the smoky flavor. 

Gao Bao / Steamed buns - great. They came in racks of six when I was only expecting five per order. Bonus buns!

Duck noodles - great. I think they put fried dry noodles in since when I first opened the container they were rather crunchy but by the end they had become soft. Decent amount of duck in the noodles too. 

Duck soup - TBD. I&apos;m stuffed and saving it for another day. 

Complimentary dessert rice cake - meh. Wasn&apos;t impressed but I still ate them all. Nice texture but not much of a flavor. Cant complain as they were included at no cost and a nice surprise."
5,"My fabulous professor the best, she new my no car having ass couldn&apos;t get north so she kindly brought some roast duck to me. Duck is my favorite meat, especially Chinese roast duck and peking duck. The roast duck here was excellent, easily would recommend, that maybe because I&apos;m so partial to duck. They also included jus from the duck I think which was brilliant to dip the duck in, pour over rice, honestly I would like to see roast duck made similar like Hainan chicken rice where the chicken broth to make the rice is replaced with the duck jus. I think that would be fantastic. 

They also really pack the duck heavy, it seemed like they shoved a whole duck in that takeout box. If I ever make it up north, I would definitely stop by again. I&apos;m really intrigued by the peking duck was well, I hope it&apos;s legit peking duck and not end up being roasted duck like a lot of restaurant I&apos;ve been to in the states have claimed."
5,"I picked up the beijing duck dinner along with some side items and shared with my family and we absolutely enjoyed! (just a heads up--they increased the duck dinner price from $48 to $53--totally worth it.)
The duck dinner comes with a full duck, neatly sliced and arranged in a foil tray (to go) which includes small steamed buns and juilienned vegetables with hoisen sauce to create little sandwiches. **Pro tip- order an extra set of steamed buns!! The duck dinner also includes duck fried rice and duck carcass soup.
The duck itself was succulent and super juicy. The skin was crisp and so flavorful--even after a 45 minute car ride! 
We also ordered beef and broccoli with egg noodles which was a large portion and a perfect pairing with the duck dinner. 
The chicken potstickers were also good, but did not stand out as anything special."
3,"Definitely mixed feelings about this place.
They are, at the moment, opened for dine in. (I don&apos;t think they updated their hours of operations on here)
It&apos;s a big restaurant so social distancing is definitely a thing here. They had one lady taking care of the whole restaurant so service was a tad slower but she was still pretty much on top of everything
We ordered the wonton soup &amp; noodles with a large order of the duck. The large is massive (she said it&apos;s one whole duck but it was def bigger than just one..) I&apos;m not complaining but you better be hungry! 
They also have an option for a guy to come to your table and cut the duck right in front of you but I hear it&apos;s more expensive. I think it&apos;s worth it .. especially what I&apos;m about to tell you next. 

As we were leaving, we passed by the kitchen area where they cut the duck and prepare some of the other plates, I saw the guy cutting the duck and plating it with his bare hands. And right next to him was another lady taking veggies out of the container with her bare hands and putting it directly on to the plate. It was absolutely disgusting to see .. I was shocked because it was such a open area where anyone could see! I&apos;m not sure what I would have said or done if I saw this before eating my meal. 

By no means am I saying this place is dirty or anything, I&apos;m just hoping that was an accident and that they use gloves every time."
4,"This was the first time I tried duck from an asian restaurant, and it was really good! We ordered the duck dinner along with a couple sides. The duck was really moist and juicy and flavorful. It was more fatty than chicken, but it was still really good. The warm buns it came with were really nice, and adding some veggies and sauce that it came with made for a great duck sandwich! The potstickers and egg noodles with beef were also pretty good. The only thing I did not like was the duck soup. But otherwise, this was a great feast!"
5,"Got the Beijing duck with friends. The duck itself was delicious. I do think a little bit of crispiness was lost in transport, but that&apos;s to be expected. It comes with more than enough vegetables for the six bao. Great place to people watch."
5,"Came here once a couple years ago with a big group of friends and we had an amazing time. The Duck dinner comes with roasted duck, scallion, carrots and pickled radish and hoisin sauce with six little baos. The duck is incredible. Juicy and tender and the skin is just cooked to perfection. So crispy. The guy will come around and cut the duck for you expertly

They also bring out for you duck fried rice which is perfectly seasoned and it&apos;s a massive portion. 

Lastly they bring out this refreshing duck soup that has a great broth. It&apos;s a fantastic meal for just $50?! Are you kidding me? A duck dinner could easily feed four maybe six people. My wife and I ordered it just for the two of us and we had leftovers for a couple more meals haha

Overall I love this place. I&apos;d definitely recommend it and I&apos;ll definitely be going back"
5,"Sun Wah is one of Chicago&apos;s quintessential eating establishments, and a great place for groups of four and more! The Peking duck dinner is really the only thing you should be coming for, because they roast a spectacular duck here and I haven&apos;t had better in the city. The rest of the food on the menu is just okay--Chinatown has better.

For four people, one duck dinner is just about enough, which comes with a large plate of sliced duck, six bao buns, a plate of fried rice, and a large bowl of soup. I&apos;d recommend ordering extra buns since the meat will definitely outnumber the pieces of buns that you have, and a vegetable dish for health. The server brings out the roasted duck whole, and will carve/slice it table-side. It&apos;s always a spectacle to watch, and the meat is always super juicy, fatty, and crispy, all in one bite. The fried rice and soup are average, but complements the duck meat nicely. If you have five or more people in your group, it&apos;d be a good idea to get two ducks.

A good rule of thumb is to call beforehand to see if they are busy and get a reservation, and to come for lunch or an early dinner. Sometimes near the end of the day they run out of ducks which is just about the saddest thing the waiter can tell you after you&apos;ve been seated. For Covid protocol, they require you fill out a form with contact info for contact tracing, and also provide hand sanitizer at your table."
5,Happy Thanksgiving! I brought Sun Wah a frozen turkey from Costco and they made it like Peking Duck! Crispy skin and tender meat just like the original. So sad the Pilgrims never tasted this fantastic variation on the James Beard Award winning Peking Duck. Steamed my own buns and pickled my own daikon.
4,"I remember when this place was on Argyle, many years ago. I frequented it often then, so it was wonderfully reassuring to find that not much has changed here. The food, especially the Par Pei Duck (BBQ) is delicious in that crave-worthy way, with a nice, crispy skin and the same salty dipping brine I remember. We also tried the pork spareribs and the Chinese broccoli on our latest visit, and everything was excellent. I&apos;ll return often to pick up my food, and look forward to dining in when that becomes possible."
5,"Best Chinese (Hong Kong/Cantonese) restaurant north of the city, that is, not part of Chicago&apos;s Chinatown.

Food:
Fried calamari - 5/5 - salty, spicy deliciousness
Fried (battered) soft shell crab - 4.5/5 - very good but not outstanding 
Wontons - 5/5 - shrimp with pork
Shrimp dumplings - 5/5 - also shrimp with pork! This is even better than the wontons in my opinion 
Roast duck - 5/5 - as good as it gets
Roast pork - 5/5 - as good as it gets
Barbecue pork - 5/5 - as good as it gets
Fried egg noodles with seafood - 4/5 - perfect texture and savory sauce, however the seafood was not of fresh quality, especially the scallops
Yang chow/Duong Chau fried rice - 4.5/5 - very good, slightly on the bland side
Roast duck fried rice - 4.5/5 - very good, slightly on the bland side
Roast pork fried rice - 4.5/5 - very good, slightly on the bland side
Lobster in ginger onion sauce - 5/5 - excellent; as delicious as other Chinese restaurants&apos; version of this classic style


Ambience:
Large spacious eatery style restaurant 

Service:
Fast, friendly and efficient"
5,"We called ahead to order the duck feast, were seated early upon our arrival, and holy chalupa, is it WAY too much food for two people? Yes and Yes.

Service was great. Speedy. Helpful. 
And the duck bao, dressed with pickled vegetables and hoisin sauce...all of it is making me salivate currently.

We took a LOT of the rice home. And the soup. Of course we downed the baos, but the duck tasted as good as leftovers the next day. It also warmed my heart that this place was bustling even at 6pm on a Saturday night. I first went maybe 8 years ago, and it&apos;s just great to see communities supporting local businesses, especially when they&apos;re so obviously doing many things right.

I think we got tea and a few beers and the total, with tip was $70."
5,"Loved it. We ordered the Peking duck dinner for takeout. It comes with duck soup, a whole roast duck cut up, duck friend rice, and six ban (the little sandwich bread). 

$48.

We would definitely get it again. Also, I dug the Diagonal Alley sign."
1,"Phone Call prior to going out:
Are you open? Yes
Do you have Peking Duck? Yes 
Do you want my name to pick up Peking duck? No
We drive 45 minutes round trip and they say Peking duck is only available at 2pm. It 12:00pm. 

You guys are fucking morons. Get your shit together."
3,"Sun Wah has always been a Chicago Asian community staple. Will grant an extra star for its pioneering and popularizing of the Peking Duck and fluffy bao bun sandwiches, which has drawn significant attention from western media outlets and attracted a wider clientele to traditional Cantonese cuisine. While slightly more expensive than its competitors in the area, the food here is consistently good.

I have really fond memories of eating here as a child with my parents back in the day when the original shop was located on Argyle Street. There was a particularly personable waitress (now retired?) who always made the experience such a treat--very rare for a Mom-and-Pop Chinese place I tell ya!

Which is why when I recently came by to pick up some take-out, I was really disappointed to see that the quality of service has not kept up as they&apos;ve grown into a larger and more sophisticated space. I had a short and superficial interaction with the staff. But you can tell that the cashier/butcher didn&apos;t care to make a good impression: he was slow moving, disinterested, didn&apos;t say a single word to me the entire time.

While I&apos;ve never been personally snubbed by the personnel there, I have heard multiple bad stories from relatives, particularly middle-aged Chinese Mom&apos;s who are not fluent in English, about getting sass from staff. My mom tells me that she would rather make the drive down south to Chinatown than to patronize Sun Wah because of their service. Now Chinatown is not known for their customer service, so that should speak volumes about what to expect at Sun Wah. Perhaps Sun Wah is no longer dependent on this demographic to sustain themselves now that they&apos;re so established, though I would think that the crowd that helped build their success deserves better."
5,"This was drafted before pandemic.... then an update below 

11/2019 Wow! Wow! Char Siu wow! Kelly the delightful proprietor seated us and was so friendly! What a great ambassador for an awesome place. Such a fun, lively place. 

12/27/20 UPDATE! We drove down for a fun outing during pandemic and it did not disappoint!! Super Char Sui, it&apos;s the best BBQ Pork in Chicagoland!! And omg the EGGROLLS! The owner, Kelly, is great and the fare is amazing, even take out and after a :40 drive! Worth it!"
4,"I love Hong Kong style BBQ so I&apos;ve been wanting to try this place for a while. This place is popular and in Viet town so you may want to choose a less popular time to eat here to avoid hassles like wait times and finding parking. 

The peking duck is must get because it not only includes a whole duck but also soup and fried rice. I think it was $40-something dollars. The strange downside is you only get 6 buns (I guess downside is relative to how many people in your group). Ordering extra buns is not pricey. Roast pork was good but the skin should have been crispier. I also love Hong Kong style pan fried noodles. Their noodles had a good amount of sauce so the noodles were very gooey and soft. BUT needed some salt. Portion sizes were big. Overall, not perfect, but close, definitely worth trying, and returning.

5,"We&apos;d never had Peking Duck before and what an introduction! I imagine it&apos;s even more divine when dining-in. We got the Duck Dinner for take-out. For $48 dollars you get an incredible amount of foo, including a whole platter of duck, duck soup, duck fried rice, bao buns, and pickled vegetables. It easily could feed 6 people. Everything was delicious! 

Also-do yourself a favor and read about their restaurant and family on their website. It&apos;s delightful. 

COVID-specifc: They offer curbside; just ask."
