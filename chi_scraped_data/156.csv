5,"Love love love this place! They have a great menu with options for everyone. My mom and I both got the Wok Out Bowl with chicken and teriyaki sauce. My mom got sticky brown rice, and I had the lo mein noodles with mine. Both so delicious! The bowl comes with vegetables - carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, and cashews. They were able to accommodate no mushrooms, since those aren&apos;t my cup of tea. 

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and you can&apos;t beat the location in the heart of the Gold Coast. 

They have great COVID precautions - even providing hand sanitizer at the table for us to use. It did not feel crowded. They had tables explicitly blocked off for social distancing. They also had some tents set up outside for outdoor dining (although not the cutest looking)."
5,"This was a nice interruption to our afternoon adventures in order to refuel.  We stopped in for lunch and was immediately greeted with genuine welcomes.  Even though I couldn&apos;t see their smiles through their masks, you can still tell based on some upper facial expressions. There were two women at the hostess stand that sat us at a socially distanced table.  As she walked us over, she explained when we were able to remove our face coverings as well as offered hand sanitizer for our table.  We felt safe being indoors based on their detailed protocols.  Our waiter was just as friendly and even shared that he was from a similar stomping ground as us.  

As for the food, we ordered the bacon appetizer because why not and it was pretty tasty.  I had not made the healthiest food choices prior to this visit so it was time to behave and order a nice salad.  I also enjoyed a refreshing whiskey smash while chowing down on my Knife and Fork Cobb salad with grilled chicken.  Atmosphere = great, Service = perfect, Food = delicious. The end"
5,"So glad Doc B&apos;s opened back up for limited indoor seating! I always have such a great experience and such great food at Doc B&apos;s. The wok out bowl is my staple order. I was a little bummed that they ran out of fillet so had to change my order to shrimp, but honestly it was just as good! My boyfriend is now obsessed with the buttermilk fried chicken and the BBQ and honey mustard that come alongside it. They have such a diverse menu - there truly is something for everyone. I will definitely be back soon for another amazing nosh!"
5,Excellent choice for hamburgers.  (recommended by the staff at the Louis vuitton store ) Menu offered great options but also allowed us to build the burger our way. Only knock was ordering a soda and recieved a glass full of ice.......come on man. Bug they did provide a free refill. Very nice and clean atmosphere with some cool music
5,Came here and grabbed take out today and wow it was so good! My friend and I ordered the California Salad with blackened shrimp and the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Both were so good! The sweet potato fries were legit fresh cut sweet potatoes so I didn&apos;t even feel guilty eating them! I would deff come back and dine in.
5,Really good! I love it! Stay at the White Hall so just a few steps away. Pick up order was quick and seamless
4,"No dearth of good restaurants in downtown Chicago. Last time I was here it was a couple of decades ago when I was on my first job and couldn&apos;t even afford a combo at Popeyes. So, indulging in some good food was even more fulfilling this time around. 

As always I wanted to cover as many categories on the menu as possible. 

Housemade Guacamole -5/5 (Sweet potato chips go perfectly with the fresh Guacamole)
Hot chicken - 2.5/5 (&apos;Not Hot&apos; and a bit bitter. Disappointing)
Pepperoni Pizza - 3.5/5
Grilled Chicken Salad - 4/5

Service - 5/5 ( thank you Emma N)
Food - 3.5/5
Ambience - 4/5"
3,"Saw that this restaurant had good ratings, so I figured I would try it with my family during our vacation. The servers were friendly and the service was good. 

I decided to get the hot chicken (sandwhich), as it sounded really good. The chicken itself was cooked well, however there was almost no sauce on the sandwhich. It made for a dry and non flavorful sandwhich unfortunately. The Cole slaw helped balance the dryness with its creaminess and sweetness, however overall i was a bit disappointed with the restaurant. I think if the sandwich had more sauce and flavoring, this could have been a 5/5 review. My parents&apos; food was good, but nothing spectacular. I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to try this place again, but it&apos;s located in a very cool part of Chicago and has friendly staff."
4,"I&apos;ve only ordered delivery from here, and every time I love it! I used to only get the knife and tine salad bc it&apos;s so good, but I tried the wok out bowl with chicken and was pleasantly surprised. The chicken is always juicy and tender, the veggies always fresh!  They call the noodles lo mein, but these are clearly udon noodles. Nevertheless, the wok out bowl is really tasty. Their salads are also very fresh and delicious. I love doc b&apos;s, I only took away a star bc I do think it&apos;s a bit overpriced."
5,"Great spot! A little pricey but normal for being right if Michigan Ave. We stopped right before going to the top golf swing suite around the corner. 

Atmosphere: Modern/smaller restaurant 

Cost: anywhere from 15-30 for an entree

My favorites: Wok-out Bowls and Sweer Potato Fries (they are wonderful!)

Will be back. They also seem to prefer reservations and usually not too hard to snag a last minute one."
5,"Stopped by before hitting up more museums,  the hight stars absolutely reflect this restaurant.  Great food, my wife was thrilled they make their own veggie burger patties. The sweet potato chips also were a nice treat. A+++. Well worth stopping by."
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to go to Doc B&apos;s since they opened in the Gables so I finally had time to stop in for happy hour and it didn&apos;t disappoint.

I sat at the bar while waiting for a coworker to arrive and noticed this delicious candied bacon in front of me. I asked the bartender who ordered it. She said, &quot;it&apos;s for you&quot;.  What?  I wasn&apos;t aware of this complimentary strips of bacon and they were big too. Perfect for pairing with my cocktails which BTW were only $5 for wells including Gin, Rum, Scotch, Tequila, Vodka, and Whiskey. I also tried one of the specialty cocktails called The Dangler made with Traverse City Whiskey, carrot juice, and maple. It was quite refreshing. For food, I got the Cajun Chicken Littles for $9. Folks, these were not little at all and they were delicious. They even came with fresh crispy fries.

I&apos;m a fan of this place and will definitely come back. I like the huge bar, friendly service, and good happy hour deals. I may have to try their Miami Spice Menu cause it looks good too :)"
4,The number six sandwich is good. The potato products they make are just okay. The fries aren&apos;t crispy. They&apos;re kind of soggy and just greasy. The tenders were good but there&apos;s only 3 and the sauces were just okay. The BBQ was super runny and barely had flavor. The honey mustard was fine. The potato stuff that comes with the sandwich is just okay. You really need the dip that comes with it otherwise it&apos;s just a potato with some cheese flakes on top. They packaged it well.
5,We picked up an order tonight as we usually do and there were a few mishaps. We debated about contacting them and decided to. Lynsey called immediately and was EXTREMELY apologetic. We did not ask for but she comped our meal. Her attitude and being pro active cemented our frequent dining at Doc B&apos;s and this review and recommendations to our contacts.
4,"Visited Chicago for the weekend and heard great things about Doc B&apos;s on Yelp. The experience did not disappoint. Our server was very knowledgeable on drink options, and had great recommendations. Loved the Backyard Burger and the Cherry Cider and the Flywheel Pilsner."
3,"The food was okay.  We ordered the ribs &amp; fries with the: Cajun club &amp; sweet potato fries.  The ribs were decently seasoned.  They were beef, so not much on the bone but not bad.  Everything else, especially the sweet potato fries, was .  The server was also good."
4,"Doc B&apos;s has something for everybody. They have simple straightforward seafood, more complicated dishes inspired by different cuisines, and then make your own options if you truly can&apos;t find anything (but you probably can)!

I stopped by for dinner with a friend early evening and the place was busy! They have outdoor seating when it&apos;s nice out, a bar that appears to have happy hour, and then proper seating. I suggest making a reservation as the tables quickly fill up. 

I ordered the wok out with salmon. I chose a teriyaki sauce and the veggie bow. The bowl came with rice, broccoli, and cashews. The salmon was a small portion(seemed like 4 oz) but the meal will hearty and filling. My friend order the Cajun crusted trout which was perfectly prepared. 

Service was great. Our server was knowledgeable and attentive."
5,This is my first time trying out DocB&apos;s I ordered ribs with cole slaw and French fries. I don&apos;t remember the last time I had such amazing tasting ribs! The meat falls right off the bone and the Smokey sauce is just to die for!

Loved this restaurant / menu! The location is prime and the menu is perfect size! We had zero wait time! The only reason I am not giving a full 5 stars is because of our waitress (see below). 

I did the Elder Flower Martini, the drink special. I have never had a better tasting drink. 

Food was phenomenal! So good that I forgot to take pictures(I blame the martini) We did the House Made Guacamole with sweet potatoes chips. We had never had sweet potato chips with  before so we were hesitant but man was is good! I did The Number Six sandwich with fries. The fries alone deserve their own rating because of how good they are! The sandwich was great too! I had requested the habanero-honey BBQ be on the side, and it was not. When I brought this to the waitresses attention she made me feel as it it were my fault and did not offer to fix the mistake, just said sorry. 

The waitress made a few other comments/looks when we asked questions about menu which is why I am only giving 4 stars. Maybe she was having s bad night? But when you have 3 people at a restaurant they have never dined before asking questions shouldn&apos;t be out of the norm. 

Adding this place to our list of must visits while in Chicago!"
4,"When at 900 N Michigan but didn&apos;t like options at Aster Hall, so we went across the street to Doc B&apos;s and that was the best idea ever! I didnt want to spend $13 at Aster Hall for a sandwich but didn&apos;t mind spending $19 on a sandwich at Doc B&apos;s!

Entering- hosts were very welcoming &amp; friendly. Getting seated was easy. 

Server- excellent. Knew the menu really well, how food is prepared with wuat ingredients. 

The ambiance is fun, service is great, but the food taste isn&apos;t the best. 

Soup of the day, Gumbo: $8 too thick and not enough Cajun flavor for me. The shrimp was the best part of the gumbo. 

Kale &amp; Goat Cheese pizza: $16 best dish from my order. Kale is crispy, loved the balsamic glaze that made pizza sweet. I&apos;m not a pizza crust fan so feel like I&apos;ve wasted too much pizza. 

Wear Coast Steak Sandwich: $19 we told server we&apos;d be splitting the sandwich and they halved it for us (without asking!)-- I thought that was nice!! I think if you eat the entire sandwich, it might&apos;ve been a little more flavorful but since I got half, the center was juicy but the ends (which were most of my bites) were not. Not a good idea to split a sandwich like this between friends. 

Also ordered a side of sweet potato fries and loved the large size roasted sweet potato fries! They were good! I didn&apos;t like the sauce that came with it though."
