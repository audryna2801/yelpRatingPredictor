5,"We had an outstanding dining experience, especially during such strange times. All staff were wearing masks. Service was exceptional. Tables were spread apart to adhere to social distancing guidelines.

Standout dishes:

sautéed shrimp with garlic butter crostini---came with 3 jumbo shrimp (you can ask for more for additional $ depending on your party size), 3 large crostini and some sort of garlicky butter sauce. The shrimp were so meaty and actually great for a starter. I&apos;m glad we didn&apos;t opt for bread service ($2.50) since the crostini were pretty large and perfect for soaking up the garlic sauce and eating with the shrimp. 

Filet (8 oz.)--perfectly cooked (medium, for me) topped with black truffle butter ($15 extra). I gave some of the butter topping to my husband because I thought it was a little too much for my filet but it definitely enhanced my steak--you could really taste the truffle with the truffle shavings. 

Signature Warm Butter Cake--I think this goes without saying. I&apos;m so glad we saved room for dessert. We heard so much of this legendary dessert and it definitely lived up to the hype. What&apos;s not to love? Warm buttery cake topped with a heaping scoop of vanilla ice cream, fresh fruit, and an entire side dish of whipped cream. It&apos;s not too sweet believe it or not. Definitely recommend not filling up during dinner and saving room for this!"
5,In the midst of Covid it&apos;s hard to find good outdoor dinning places with great service. Went here for dinner with some friends and enjoyed a very well prepped Creekstone steak. Also tried the desserts which were delicious. The only thing I found strange was that they did not have any diet soft drinks. Plan to back again next summer.
5,"With the threat of COVID-19 looming, government officials had recommended social distancing and isolation to fight the spread of Corona virus.  Therefore, I had to cancel dinner plans for my husband&apos;s birthday at the last minute which left me in a bind to come up with Plan B. Luckily enough, I came across an email from Mastro&apos;s Restaurant indicating they were open for carry-out and curbside service! My Saving Grace!! 

 I had the pleasure of speaking to Kelly McGrath-Director of Private Dining. Just like my previous dining experiences at Mastros, the service was outstanding from beginning to the end! Kelly was so attentive and courteous. She provided recommendations, accommodations for items not available on menu, and amazing deals amid crisis. Upon pick-up, Kelly brought the food out to my car and was greeted with a warm smile! I couldn&apos;t believe how easy the entire process was. 

Unfortunately, when I got home, I started to unpack the bag to find out that one of the items was missing- I called Kelly back. She asked where I lived as the general manager was going to drop it off to my house. What???? Who does that? If that&apos;s not going the extra mile please tell me what is!!! 

A truly heartfelt surprise! Many, thanks to Kelly, Steve, Chef and staff for the exceptional service, delicious food, and making my husband&apos;s celebration perfect!

Please keep in mind that local businesses are working hard to reassure take-out and dine-in customers before pandemic panic forces them to close their doors for good. Let&apos;s try to support them and contact them and inquire about deals and discounts, order from them, purchase gift cards, and tip more than usual."
5,"Butter cake and champagne all day, all day! Lol 

Seriously, the meat melts in your mouth. My favorite steakhouse in Chicago."
3,"Mastros was highly recommended for steak by our family so we went for my birthday. The food quality &amp; flavor was excellent.  The Wagyu steak  (please reach out to Broadleaf Farms and ask about the Broadleaf Wagyu Beef) &amp; Rack of Lamb are halal.

Appetizers--
The Jalapeno Sashimi was super fresh and the Lobster Bisque was light but packed with flavor.

Main Course --
The Wagyu Tomahawk 40 oz steak (requested extra seasoning on the crust) was cooked to perfection (medium). The Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Creamed Corn, and Rosemary Mushrooms complimented the steak nicely.

Dessert and Coffee --
The Butter Cake left me speechless (not only cuz I was stuffed to the rim but also cuz it was divine). Very unexpected warm softness topped with cold ice cream. Perfect duo. Paired with a cappuccino was a great ending to the meal.

However, I was quite disappointed with the service. I&apos;m not sure how much of an effect covid had on the service but here are some things I wish that could&apos;ve been different --

1. We ordered a side of roasted garlic. Our server didn&apos;t bring it out with the steak so we had to ask for it a second time. Then, she came back and told us that it would take too long to roast it so she&apos;s making a &quot;special&quot; sauce. This sauce was pureed garlic cloves. Not the best addition to the steak. It was obvious she had forgotten to put it the order.

2. We ordered an extra scoop of ice cream with the butter cake and did not get it. Although we didn&apos;t want it at the end, this was yet another item &quot;forgotten&quot; by the server.

3. As I was sitting there enjoying my meal, the table was obviously getting messy with crumbs and such. There was no service to clean the table cloth (like at other steakhouses).

4. We usually order our drinks without ice and USUALLY they are still cold with a good amount of fizz. Well, without ice our drinks were flat and warm.

5. The take-home boxes were not thought out. They are similar to fancy chinese take home boxes that I use for party favors at a baby shower. I mean. C&apos;mon! At least have the streamline black microwaveable to-go boxes!

6. This is where I wasn&apos;t sure if covid played a part here (which doesn&apos;t make sense yet because they already had contact with my food). I had to pack the food up myself to take home. Ok, we aren&apos;t talking about some Red Lobster here (altho I think they actually pack your food for you), I&apos;m talking about a restaurant that&apos;s considered to be high-end in Downtown Chicago. So no, I should not be packing my food on my night off (esp on my birthday).

Now, usually I don&apos;t write this much in detail about a restaurant unless it needs to be said. At a bill of approximately $400 IT NEEDS TO BE SAID.  When I go to a restaurant that&apos;s considered to be high-end, I expect high-end service. Although the food was a rating of 5; the service brings their rating down to a 3, unfortunately.

If my cons won&apos;t bug you at that price tag -- go for the food -- you won&apos;t regret it!"
5,Everything was first class.enjoy my dinner.The food and the staff were amazing. I am definitely coming back real soon
1,"We ordered pickup from here and they didn&apos;t give us two of the dishes we ordered. They said they couldn&apos;t do anything about it because we ordered through Waiter. Waiter said it&apos;s not their problem that mastros forgot our food and we didn&apos;t check our bags until we got home. Definitely sucks to spend almost $400 on a meal, including a $50 tip, and not even get the food we paid for. I just don&apos;t understand how a nice restaurant can give this kind of service for pickup."
5,"Many know this to be a great place for steak, but if you haven&apos;t tried dessert, you&apos;re missing something special. 
PLEASE try the butter cake and if you hurry, you can try the pumpkin flavored butter cake. Limited time only. Every crumb is rich, buttery and flavorful. Served with a vanilla bean and bourbon vanilla ice cream and don&apos;t forget to top it off with the caramel sauce! Go get it!"
3,"I went to Mastro&apos;s in Houston about 2 weeks ago and had an amazing time. I was expecting the same thing here but it was not the same. Everything is better in Texas! However, i had a reservation at 9:30 and we arrived early at 9:18 but did not seat until 9:50. We ordered appetizer, salads and a meal. The salads and meal came out before our appetizer. I had to ask the waiter for the appetizer. I know they were sitting in the back because i just got the sautéed shrimp 2 weeks ago in houston and i know how they should taste and the temperature when it is brought fresh the kitchen. The sweet butter cake is amazing! Best dessert they serve by far! If you really want a good experience i think you should save this restaurant visit for Houston. In all honesty because Chicago Mastro&apos;s and Houston&apos;s Mastro&apos;s do not even compare."
1,Update on my review. I&apos;ve been to Mastro&apos;s a few times and each time has been amazing. Group of 5 of us went last night for birthday dinner. The food was terrible. I don&apos;t know what happened to this place. But from the steaks to our side dishes. Everything was horrible. None of us finished our food. We left feeling so disappointed especially because the amount we spent. I honestly would not have even paid $20 for that meal. The steak was tasteless and super salty. The lobster mash potatoes were runny. Nothing tasted good. Very disappointed!
5,"Came here for NYE dinner and it did not disappoint! Even as a steakhouse chain, the quality is consistent. Our server was great too and really attentive to us. Everyone in your party needs to be present before you can be seated. Our other pair was running really late so we got a drink at the lounge bar -- I got a whiskey one and it was really good. On the lounge floor they even had some live music and balloons everywhere giving you that NYE feel. The were seated on the second floor which is packed, but I didn&apos;t feel congested. 

Meal deats: 

Foie gras - classic serving with bread, jam, balsamic reduction sauce, and micro greens. I love foie gras so this was a great starter.

Lobster Mac &amp; cheese - lots of lobster chunks and the mash was nice and creamy and garlicy. Delicious! 

Rib eye - cooked medium rare and was super juicy, nice ratio of fat/meat. Very satisfied here! 

Truffle butter - a $15 add on and no regrets! There was a crazy strong truffle flavor and it a decadent pair with the steak (and complimentary bread and just about everything else). 

Warm butter cake - cannot skip! So make sure you save your stomach for it! It was gooey on the inside with a thin crisp outside and topped with a generous goop of ice cream. Perfect ending. 

Our order was messed up a little that they gave us a regular mash so not only did we keep that along with our lobster mash, but they also put the dessert on the house which was really nice. With a bottle of wine as well and for 4 people, our bill including tip was about $100 per person so not bad at all. 

I will definitely be back!"
4,"We came here for a restaurant week splurge, and I will say that the deal was excellent considering that the 8 oz filet entree option would be pricier on its own from the original menu. So that was a nice reason to indulge at this well known steakhouse! We were seated in the lounge area and enjoyed the live music, though the atmosphere seemed a little too casual for such a nice steakhouse. The food definitely made up for it though. The service wasn&apos;t anything outstanding, but good enough.

I had the mambo salad as my appetizer, but I was disappointed that as a result of asking for cheese on the side it was only lettuce and dressing. The spicy dressing was delicious though, and when you add the complimentary bread as makeshift croutons, you&apos;ve got a great ceasar salad! I had to try the filet as my entree, and this was perfectly medium rare - tender, super flavorful, and perfectly pink in the middle. Excellent steak and finished every bite. It was definitely a good choice for us three girls to share the brussel sprouts side as well. They weren&apos;t the best brussels I&apos;ve had but standard and not bad at all. 

As for dessert, I highly recommend the cheesecake. I tried both the warm butter cake and cheesecake, and surprisingly the cheesecake was my favorite. The warm butter cake wasn&apos;t as warm or soft as I would have liked, but the ice cream topper was delicious. We also had a nice bottle of  pinot noir to complement our meal as well. Overall, it was excellent food, but the atmosphere (of the lounge at least) didn&apos;t fit the prices or the hype of Mastro&apos;s. Definitely a great restaurant week spot though!"
4,"Good spot for a work dinner with great food and service. As a big group, we were able to get a bit of everything. We had the seafood tower, sushi, porterhouse steak, tomahawk steak, and a bunch of sides. The seafood was fresh and the steak cooked perfectly medium rare as requested.

This is the place to get your classic steakhouse fix with steakhouse prices."
5,"I don&apos;t say this lightly, but Mastro&apos;s in Chicago has probably the juiciest ribeye I&apos;ve ever had in my life. I&apos;m a huge fan of ribeye and with so many good restaurants it&apos;s sometimes hard to distinguish the difference. But I can safely say that Mastro&apos;s would be my go-to for good steak.

I came here for my boyfriend&apos;s company holiday party, and the whole experience was amazing from start to finish. The dinner began with massive seafood towers topped with gigantic shrimp, crab, and mussels. Not a fan of a lot of seafood, but the shrimp was amazing. The bread that came out at the same time was also delicious although the crust was a bit too hard for my liking.

By the time my entree and the sides came along I was stuffed. But wow, oh wow, where do I begin. That first bite of ribeye was heaven. The steak melted so easily in my mouth and the meat was so tender that I couldn&apos;t believe it! The macaroni was my personal favorite side, but all of them were good.

I will definitely be back for another dining experience."
5,"I had been here a long while ago for a business dinner but I had not been back until tonight for Restaurant Week with a Yelper friend. The reservation was made on Open Table and the table was ready upon our arrival. Gotta love that! They offered coat check which we opted for and gave us a choice between the lounge or main dinning room.

The waitress was prompt to greet us with a friendly introduction of their specials. She knew from our reservation we came in for Restaurant Week and provided recommendations without trying to steer us off the set menu. She did suggest shared sides since the steak would come a la carte but I am really glad we didn&apos;t do that because I was plenty stuffed by the end of our meal without it.

For starters the bread... nothing better than a nice warm breadbasket of assorted options and butter pads that are not cold. Hello pretzel bun!

I ordered the tuna sashimi appetizer which was very flavorful with just the right amount of tangy and spicy. My friend the French onion soup - perfect for a colder night. Neither overly filling but a good teaze for the main course.

We both enjoyed 8oz fillets and their gooey butter cake dessert. Presentation was unusually basic for an upscale restaurant but the flavor made up for any lack of a fancy plate. Service was professional, just the right level of interaction and careful not to pull plates too quickly. 

Overall, a five-star meal, five-star service and a classy ambiance. I&apos;d highly recommend Mastro&apos;s if you are in the mindset to treat yourself!"
4,Came here  twice . Once last year before covid and once this year during COVID outside in the tents . Both for our anniversary. Great experiences . Be ready to spend some money  but well worth it . Would come back again.
2,"Mastros used to be our go to for special occasions prior to the covid outbreak. We recently decided against our better judgment to try their take out option for my wife&apos;s birthday. We spent $600 to order several steaks, one of which was a filet for my wife who hates ribeye above all other cuts. They gave her a ribeye instead. All the steaks were overcooked save the one for my mother in law that got well done because she&apos;s strange like that. The lobster mash was a god dang soup, not mashed potatoes. On top of all this, the side portions were way smaller than in restaurant but they charged the same. 

I tried calling them and their machine told me to dial 107 to leave a message. Pressing it brought me back to the beginning of the loop again. It&apos;s impossible to get in touch. I tried contacting The customer support for their online ordering app, waitr, and the chat window kept reloading and dying so overall there is nothing we can do. The food was terrible, I wouldn&apos;t have paid $60 for it.

We will never go to Mastros again, they must have laid off all the competent staff during the outbreak. Pics!

My order screen shot from waitr is included, as well as a screenshot of the receipt Mastro&apos;s gave me. Methinks maybe Waitr and Mastro&apos;s May want to double check their system integration.

UPDATE: I&apos;ve added an additional star to this review as Waitr processed a $85 refund for my meal. Still not the usual great food for the price paid, but at least they tried to fix things. Thought you all should know."
5,"Our go-to for a special occasion. Top notch service and flawless steaks. Sides and salads all worth the $$$. You get what you pay for, for sure."
4,"We came here for restaurant week so I was happy to try their menu at a discounted price.

Service and ambiance - 5 stars 
They check your coat right away, the lighting is low, the seats are comfortable (tables are a little close together though as I could easily hear the conversation next to me).

To start I had the mambo salad (basically a Caesar salad with a slight kick). The portion was great and I like the cheese mixed in. They also start you off with a big bowl of bread. 

Food was served in a timely manner. 

For the steak it was good but not differentiated enough for me for a high end restaurant. For $55, I&apos;ve had a better steak. Good yes, but for the price I&apos;ve had better, that&apos;s all I&apos;m saying."
3,"The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and the service was good. 
The taste of the food and drinks were not as expected, especially at this price point. My steak was bland no seasoning, I guess that is why the waitress was trying to push the specialty butters and toppings. Also, the sauté asparagus could have been mashed asparagus. Definitely was disappointed with my experience."
