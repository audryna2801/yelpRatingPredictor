5,"Incredible. First, felt super safe with mask requirements even when approached by staff at table. They give you a personal hand sanitizer (yours to keep) and a lanyard to keep your mask handy at all times. Love this approach.

Now the food - outrageous. My new favorite restaurant in Chicago. Standouts were the foie gras, sablefish and the souffle. The fabled pasta dish was good but a tad salty.

I also highly recommend the non-alcoholic beverage pairing. Lots of beautiful Japanese inspired flavors that paired really well with their dishes. My boyfriend&apos;s old fashioned was also the best I&apos;ve ever tasted. (On the sweet side).

Wonderful service."
5,"We went back earlier this year and expected that perhaps it wouldn&apos;t live up to our high expectations a second time--but it did. Just like our first visit, everything was absolutely perfect. I also enjoyed that the menu was different but the same as before. The courses were primarily of the same type, but with different notes and twists. That made us look forward to the same dishes again while still feeling it was fresh and new. Again, just love love love love.

Also add Alinea to the list of restaurants Oriole far exceeds, in my book!"
4,"Came here for an early celebration of my partner&apos;s boyfriend pre-covid-19. All the expectations of a 2 Michelin business, plus additional added flares to make the experience unique, starting with the entrance way! but I won&apos;t give anything else away on that. 

I forgot the exact numbers but the seating capacity in the dining room is something around 30-40 and they time the reservations out so the room is only half filled (maybe because of social distancing or because this is not they normally are, not sure). 

About 14+ courses of small bites and the dinner last a little over 3 hours. The dishes were all presented very eloquently and deliberately and on some occasions one of the chefs would come by to add the finishing touches right at the table which was nice and gave you a chance to tell them thank you. Dishes were a mix of many different cultures and styles of cooking and even though small, really nicely made. We left not full, but tired because it was a long dinner. I kind of wish for some more surprises in flavor, but the food went exactly with the vibe of Oriole. Had the higher quality items like caviar, wagyu, and truffles of course. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience."
4,I enjoyed a beautiful evening meal. It was a nice experience for me for the first time. This restaurant was my all-time favorite forever. They strive to provide us the best foods and service that exceeds our expectations. Try their services and you won&apos;t regret it for sure. Thank you so much to all of you! Perfect!
5,"This is a fairly belated review but I can explain - You know the saying, don&apos;t let perfect be the enemy of good? Well, I failed to do so and slept on the review for way too many nights, fearing that a less than perfect review wouldn&apos;t do this place justice.

My best friend and I came here at the end of October. The entrance to the restaurant couldn&apos;t be more inconspicuous. The waiting area that made us curious and curiouser was essentially a freight elevator, through which we were introduced into an intimate and stylish loft-like dining room that somehow also managed to be both upscale and cozy. Coming from New York where space is a luxury, I really appreciated the generous table spacing. The tasting menu was incredible - no weak links. My favorites were the Hudson Valley Foie Gras, A5 Wagyu, and truffle capellini. Service was absolutely impeccable. Meticulous attention to detail - simply make a trip to the restroom and you&apos;ll know what I&apos;m talking about. 

We&apos;re lucky to have enjoyed a few Michelin-starred tasting menus, and while each was unique in its own way, we both agree that this is by far the best we&apos;ve experienced, from food to service to ambiance."
4,"We celebrated Christmas in Chicago this year. Oriole has been on my list of to-try for a coupe years. I&apos;ve always tried and failed to make reservations in the past, so this year I planned pretty far ahead and snatched a slot as soon as it opened up on OpenTable. 

The entire experience is worthy of 2 stars. The service here is extremely attentive! They even have someone run ahead of you every time you head to the restroom. A bit unnecessary, but very sweet of the staff.

The one thing that was a bit off for us was how salty some of our first courses were. Perhaps the mid-west prefers a heavier taste then what we&apos;re use to. We mentioned this to the staff and our remaining courses were perfect! If you find the first few courses to be too strong, don&apos;t hesitate to mention your preferences earlier rather than later in the meal. 

Everything is a surprise so we didn&apos;t know what was coming throughout the night. I really enjoy these elements of surprise in a long meal. I&apos;ve found myself reading and re-reading the menu at other restaurants and it puts some unnecessary expectations or hopes into the meal that can alter the experience. 

Portion wise - oriole was perfect! We left satisfied - not hungry and not over-stuffed."
5,"Managed to score a late 9pm reservation on a Friday night a few months back while on a trip to Chicago. My wife and I arrived about 5 minutes early and reception made conversation with us and poured us a welcome cocktail with peach which was good. They keep you in this little entry area and there&apos;s a freight elevator door that opens when it&apos;s your time to go in, really interesting way to enter. One of the cute little things they do here is having you pick out your own personal silverware holder that they will place various things on throughout the meal.

I had the standard beverage pairing for my dishes and my wife ordered a couple of mocktails along the way. All of the pairings were excellent and we also enjoyed the mocktails. The ambiance was upscale, quiet, and pretty comfortable - the place didn&apos;t come off overly stiff to me. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable, and cracked a joke or two along the way. The sommelier was excellent, explaining each of the pairings and had answers to even some questions I thought he may not know. I like that even two michelin star places have started straying away from just going with wine the whole way through. My favorite pairing had to be the 2016 Eric Bordelet Pear Cider from Normandy with the Delice de Bourgogne souffle with sesame and lemon.

The food was exquisite. I&apos;m not planning to go into the whole menu dish by dish here - but the ingredients are of the highest quality, and they use a lot of truffle, caviar, mushrooms, and expensive seafoods as well. It&apos;s a nice mix of what I&apos;d imagine an old school fine dining New York institution would use crossed with many high end Japanese ingredients. They intertwine these ingredients with a calm hand, allowing flavors to speak for themselves - every dish is a delicate interplay instead of hitting you over the head with flavor punch.

My favorite dish was the Favo di Tartuffo, a stellar mushroom course with summer truffle, yeast and puffed wheat. If you like that earthy extremely savory feel and turn it to 11, this is the course you get. It was also a really awesome textural experience - chewy in a good way.

The other standout for me had to be the Sablefish, with urfa biber, sweet corn, and genmai. This course was a duo, the other half was rillettes with smoked golden whitefish roe and creme fraiche. A very well done balance soft texture and delicate, sweet flavors dualing with some pungent umami on the other side with crisp textures.

The desserts never seemed to stop and were also excellent and worth mentioning. Quite simply the best execution and start to finish meal I&apos;ve ever had all around. The send home with the chai tea packet is a nice touch and we enjoyed that too as we reminisced about this meal. 

Oh, and I almost forgot... the Japanese milk bread with ramp butter was out of this world."
5,"Hands down one of the best, if not the best meal I&apos;ve ever had. They absolutely nail all their insane flavor combinations, and combined with the impeccable service, a trip here is well worth the price (and the Michelin stars!). From the beginning, we knew we were in for a experience when we entered and were treated to a complimentary warm mulled apple wine cocktail, until one of the staff pulled up the metal gate and let us into the real dining area.

I won&apos;t walk through every dish we had, but some of my favorites were the foie gras with an apple anise mixture, sablefish over a red squash brown butter sauce, and their amazing soufflé. They had the best use of foie gras I&apos;ve ever tasted, with the rich fattiness cut through by the sweet and slightly crisp apple chunk and bits of creamy freshness from the creme fraiche pearls. The capellini looked a bit unassuming but packed in so much savory flavor into their slightly tart lemon sauce that was boosted by but honestly didn&apos;t even need the truffle shavings, it was just that good. The soufflé started off with the salty sharp bite of the melted cheese before the amazing, nutty caramelized flavor of the black sesame and slight hint of tartness from the lemon cut through, just a crazy bit perfect flavor combination.

The food was so good I don&apos;t even have time to go into detail about the amazing service, but we felt we were totally cared for at every step. They went to such lengths to make sure we were comfortable, answered any question we had, and were so super attentive. Whether you&apos;re a local or just visiting, I 100% think it&apos;s worth saving up and splurging on this place!"
5,"If I could give Oriole a six-star rating I would! The food was delicious, service was excellent, ambiance was perfect. Every dish was beautifully presented and made with care and love. I think the restaurant as a whole was definitely better than any Michelin stared restaurant in LA.

They texted and called us prior to our reservation to see if we had any dietary restriction. I was impressed by their customer service.

Every dish was small, they were all very pretty. The chef definitely paid attention to every detail of each dish. The only thing we thought that could improve was that most dishes were very salty for our taste, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s not salty to some people. 

They serviced the perfect amount of food, we left not feeling stuffed. I had room for two dishes (Haha). 

All the staffs were very nice and friendly. We felt very comfortable dining at Oriole. 

A well deserved two Michelin star restaurant. I will definitely revisit here if I come back to Chicago."
5,"By far the most delicious and memorable dining experience I&apos;ve had thus far in Chicago! The entrance is a little difficult to find, as it is just a door with no sign, but as soon as you walk in, you enter a new world. The hostess quickly took our coats and offered a delicious tea prior to being seated. Immediately after, the back &quot;wall&quot; started lifting up (like a garage door), displaying the dining room, which was spacious and beautifully decorated. The entrance was jaw-dropping to say the least!

I cannot say enough about the food, as there is really no way to describe it. Words just simply do not give the flavors justice! It was obvious that every dish was painfully crafted not only to perfect the flavors but the presentation as well. There was not one dish I did not love, and though the portions were small, we were all surprisingly full at the end. Food aside, the service was also extremely detail-oriented. The staff went above and beyond, not only to serve us amazing food, but also to clean our table between each course, fold our table napkins, and pull out/push in our chair every time we got up/sat down. We were truly treated like royalty at Oriole.

At the end of our experience, we were gifted a small bag of tea leaves and careful directions on how to brew it. I left with a happy stomach and will never forget this dining experience!"
5,"Amazing meal from start to finish. Service, Plating, flavors, atmosphere, everything was top notch. A really memorable experience. Only aspect that wasn&apos;t super strong for me were desserts.

All of the dishes were well composed, pretty, full of flavors and textures, with some Asian influence. So good. Started with Golden osetra and kingfish. Wonderfully balanced. Next was foie gras mousse with asian pear and whipped/frozen creme fraiche. The different temperatures and textures of the creme fraiche was genius. Next were carabinero prawns from Spain with heirloom tomato water. Not my favorite (don&apos;t love this type of shrimp), but still a nice course. Uni risotto with uni butter and a parmesan chicharron was delicious, still not sure how they got the perfect chicharron texture. Sablefish with meyer lemon sofrito and belly rillete was tasty. Milk bread was amazing, regret not asking for extra. Capellini pasta with truffle was a perfect fall dish. A5 Miyazaki - only complaint here was the small portion size. I could&apos;ve eaten 5 of these plates.

Palette cleanser was decent, loved the Campari sorbet. Sesame souffle was also very good and filling. Espresso gelato felt like a placeholder. And Mignardises were all pretty interesting and nice, but no standouts. The sent us home with a copy of the menu, a chocolate chip cookie (that was amazing) and the recipe for said cookie. Great experience, will definitely be back."
5,"Wonderful experience and innovative dinner. I wasn&apos;t able to capture the amazing detail description of each dish but we had a wonderful dinner and wine pairing.

Go for the experience and amazing service."
4,"I could go on and tell you every detail on why it was one of the best dining experiences of my life, but I&apos;ll let you create your own story. They are a 2 star for a reason. Magnificent night."
4,"This is quite possibly the best restaurant experience ever. I&apos;ll start with my dislikes because there&apos;s a mere 2. I didn&apos;t care for any of the desserts &amp; Twas a mediocre conclusion to an epic meal. The 2nd con is the price, although the food is extremely delicious only two dishes wowed me. With the aside all but once dish was amazing. I&apos;ve never had a tasting menu however I&apos;ve never experienced so many dishes being this good under one roof. The pasta dish was the absolute best I&apos;ve ever had. So complex &amp; full of flavor. The A5 wagyu was also delightful &amp; quite possibly the best rendition of dish I&apos;ve ever EVER. Oriole is also big on details such as food restrictions &amp; even whether you&apos;re left or right handed for glassware or utensil placement."
5,"So glad we finally found a time we could get away and enjoy the restaurant. As much as we wanted to bring our kids, we wanted this to be a date night. We were told they allow children and have highchairs available! But still, I was so looking forward to a night out and this dinner. It&apos;s been too long I haven&apos;t had to carry cheerios and sippy cups with me.
First entrances are important, and we loved it. The Maitre D was so nice and welcoming (she was my favorite). Some of the other stuff were a little stuffy (maybe just tired or other things going on), but still very nice. I wish I could remember our guy&apos;s name. He humored us and was very nice and helpful. (Thank you for helping me explain to my husband how glue is made  ). 

We a loved the excitement of the industrial elevator as an entrance. We were told it is working (but they did get stuck while trying). Leave your jacket and enjoy the Aperitif before they slide the doors open for your grand entrance. We had an early seating, 6pm, which was nice. There was little hub bub, things are fresh and quiet, and staff are more attentive, I feel. 

You will enjoy the menu, so no need harp on that. For us, it was not meat heavy (yay!). And even the meat dishes my husband tried and ate because of the cooking caliber here. Though, they will try to accommodate any aversions and allergies if you need. They can really do no wrong. We shared a normal wine pairing - which was more than enough for me. I did not care for the sake, just my own preference. But a warning for those in the same taste palette as me there. 
If you are wondering, most people were dressed up. That is just not my husband&apos;s and my style. We did both wear some nice things but that included jeans. The restaurant does not have a dress code."
2,"I am surprised by my lack of satisfaction leaving Oriole given the overwhelming, positive reviews. We went on 02/13 as a double date and celebrated my wife&apos;s birthday and my friend&apos;s recent job promotion. There were several highlights that were easily out weighed by the tasting experience for an overall lack luster experience.

Prior to arrival, we made our reservation weeks in advance. I&apos;d note I was particularly impressed by the communication by Oriole staff to confirm we were coming but also making sure allergies and substitutions were respected. They also offered to help personalize the experience if I wished - top marks for customer service!

The entrance to the restaurant is discrete and barely noticeable, playing to an underground and exclusive feel. Coming into the lobby, one is greeted by the hostess who on this particular occasion offered a nice toast cocktail. We were soon seated after our arrival as the first party to arrive. The environment housed a warm, urban, and gently decorated atmosphere.

Our table was taken care of by a party of staff who made sure it remained clean and kept. My trip to the bathroom revealed several single occupancy lavoratories stocked with basic amenities that one may have forgotten at home. My particular bathroom didn&apos;t have a functioning soap dispenser. I let staff know and received an accidental exchange of lotion. Third time was a charm and led to something that could clean my hands.

Returning to the table we were given the option of wine pairing of several tiers, beers, non alcoholic beverages, house cocktails, or the bar tender would make a drink per your request.  I was in a tequila mood and requested a traditional lime margarita that certainly did not disappoint. Side note of no salt and pepper on the table - I love it when this happens and when flavors are subsequently appropriately executed. More about this below.

Prior to the arrival of each course, the table was appropriately provided with the correct silverware to enjoy what was to come. The first person to set my silverware realized I was left handed and asked me if I wanted my setting to reflect as such in the future. I was so impressed and excited that she asked and said yes. This request, however, was poorly respected by subsequent individuals who set the table. I would visibly change my setting to reflect I was left handed in front of the people who kept on setting it righty; they didn&apos;t care, they kept on setting it despite the frank change. I am presuming either poor communication or a strong desire to stick to tradition. Either way, the initial excitement that my handedness was observed and accommodated fell flat and led to a frustrating rearrangement of silverware for about six courses.  Between this and the bathroom observation,  the attention to detail that I would expect was certainly in question.

Next, the food. This is the first time that we came to a tasting (doing about 15 tastings in the past two to three years) that had no amuse bouche. Each course was set and presented. We started off with a caviar that was light, flavorful, and paired a fish tartar to get the night going. Courses were probably easily finished in two to three bites and all started with unquestionably high quality ingredients with examples like A5 Wagyu, Crab, fresh shaved black truffle, imported spanish Jamo. Based on the first course we thought we were in for a real treat!

Several savory dishes followed and simply put every dish for everyone at our table was excess in salt content. A couple points in the dining experience, the salt content was so strong that my salivary glands literally started to gush. All the high quality ingredients noted above seemed wasted. Tree nuts were removed from my wife&apos;s courses but there werent any attempts at substitutions. Notably this is the first time I ever left a tasting and truly felt hungry and the need to have a meal following dinner. Also, the transition from meat to cheese to dessert seemed very abrupt and discoordinated.

The night closed with us being sent home with personalized, printed menus of the night. A card to my wife and friend wishing them congratulations, a nice, personal touch and kind gesture. Chocolate chip cookies were packed with an add on of the recipe. A nice addition but all I could think is that Oriole needed to focus on its courses before these cute additions.

The evening came to a finish and our four figure bill came without surprise. We paid and left thinking, this is the first time we were leaving a twelve course meal inappropriately satiated. While the point here isn&apos;t neccesarily to be filled up at the end, the experience was unsatisfactory with the lack of appropriate spice balance, the rushed feel, and the mix up with the tableware.  Really a subpar dining experience that doesn&apos;t match the $300/person bill. I left Oriole thinking I never need to come back here, better off with the cheeseburger available a block away."
5,"Oriole is the best, plain and simple. The quality of fine dining, with the hospitality of your friend&apos;s house. Every ounce of food is complex, interesting, and delicious. 

They keep the menu and number of courses a surprise. But some of the standouts this time around were the Golden Enoki - so complex with truffles and tarragon. The Sablefish was also amazing - king crab, a hint of spice, sort of creamy. And then finally, the wagyu - extremely fatty, but paired with a thick white asparagus that balanced out the texture amazingly. 

Oriole is also very service forward. They gave us a hand signed card for our anniversary and even put our anniversary announcement at the bottom of our menu!

No detail goes overlooked and the food is amazing to boot. If you have time for one &apos;fancy&apos; restaurant in Chicago, this is my recommendation every time."
5,"I don&apos;t know as I need to leave too big of a review for the food from Oriole.  Simply put you are going to get what is on the menu, but you will certainly enjoy it.  Uni mixed dish, A5 wagyu, delicious soup, and very tasty fish.  I knew they showed a menu online but I wanted to be surprised and go on their journey - I think that was the right choice.  Dessert was like going to a buffet where everyone is stacking a plate full of more sugar than anyone should have - and it was perfect.  Each chocolate had its own unique flavor, look, and texture - and that was only one of the dessert courses!

The service is worth a review on its own.  &quot;Impeccable&quot; only begins to describe it.  A week before we even arrived we were contacted by the hostess to take care of any special requests.  Once we arrived we had an awesome chat with her while we waited for our time slot and got a ton of good tips on other local restaurants and some behind the blade backstories.  Once seated every waiter was incredibly professional, helpful, and friendly.  The bathrooms are *never* in an unprepared state if that is any indication of the level of service (yes, even seconds after someone has left a bathroom it is re-prepared).  We were even surprised with some touching departing gifts - I&apos;ll keep them a secret as to not ruin the surprise for anyone else that visits.

If you want absolutely top notch service and simply wonderful creative dishes you need not look any further.  Oriole deserves every bit of their Michelin stars."
5,"Sublime. In every way. This may be one of the greatest meals I&apos;ve ever had, and was worth every single penny. Though the entire experience is fantastic, I think the food is what really shines here - which is what we&apos;re all here for isn&apos;t it? 

I will say the menu is very seafood heavy and Japanese inspired. I love these flavors so the menu was perfect for me, but if you&apos;re not into seafood you may not enjoy this. 

Some of our favorite dishes were:
- The nigiri trio with madai, fjord trout and Hokkaido  uni
- Perfectly smoked seabass with grilled ramp
- Pork belly with pineapple 
- Miyazaki A5 wagyu that meeelts in your mouth 

Even the welcome drink is incredible!

Yes it&apos;s pricey, but it&apos;s very worth it for a special occasion. Book it early and go with no regrets!"
5,"You all know what the shortest Bible verse is, right? John 11:35.  &quot;Jesus wept.&quot;  And then some years later Lily F. wept after eating at Oriole. 

I&apos;ll keep it short because I know your attention span is declining with every passing second.  I&apos;ve eaten at a lot of places all around the world and Oriole is as close to perfection as they come.  There are a few things I will remember for the rest of my life after eating here: 
The atmosphere was a perfect mix of intimate, elegant casual and what I would imagine James Bond&apos;s personal dining room would be like. 
The impeccable service that made you feel like you were the only diner in the world.  I felt like royalty. 
And finally the wagyu beef.  I just recently had the the wagyu at Omakase Takeya and while that was perfect, this topped it.  

They definitely deserve all the accolades and achievements. I recommend you guys come before they earn their 3rd star."
