5,"Really loved the experience and food here! Place has a back area that wasn&apos;t being used when we came in. For covid reasons, we asked to sit there and the hostess was accommodating. 

Our server was nice and gave some recs of popular dishes. We had coffee and water refills consistently, and food came out relatively quickly and hot. I got the lobo skillet which was really flavorful and filling. The hubby got the huevos verdes which he (and I because I am def a table reacher and food sharer!) enjoyed. Overall great experience and we see becoming regulars here!"
5,"In a city oversaturated with designer taco restaurants,  how is it that a place known for its brunch has the BEST carnitas tacos in town? Their homemade salsa is always so fresh and well-crafted. And the $25 ten taco platter is the best deal around. Sooo glad to see Flo pushing through the challenges of the pandemic!"
5,Amazing food and amazing service! My fiancé and I wanted to help out local businesses during covid (even if they&apos;re not that great) but every time we get FLO it just keeps getting better and better! Food is FRESH and delicious. We&apos;ve ordered from their brunch menu (holy cow the breakfast sandwich is delicious and enormous) and dinner. Will always support Flo.
4,"Great service and excellent food. 
Ordered the carnitas hash and very impressed. Over easy egg on diced potatoes with slices of carrots and red onion, topped with a chipotle sauce. 
Also split the Fruity Pebbles French Toast. Good if you have a sweet tooth, the cereal adds a nice crunch. It did attracts some bees though haha. Worth getting stung."
5,Always amazing. Got chicken enchilada with hatch chili. Served with beans and rice. YUM! Love the food here and will miss it.
5,"We came here for the first time on Sunday for Valentine&apos;s Day brunch. The food was awesome, huge portions, great taste profiles, came out quick and hot. Service was great - attentive without hovering at all. This will definitely be our new brunch spot! Excited to come back and try dinner soon."
4,"I came here with for brunch already knowing that I&apos;d order the fruity pebbles french toast because all the pictures I&apos;d seen looked too tempting to resist. And when it arrived, even the people at the table next to me started talking about how great it looked. As someone who likes sweet brunch options, I thought it was wonderful -- it appealed to the 10-year-old french toast enthusiast in me while satisfying my current taste, resulting in the perfect nostalgic brunch food. But I can definitely understand why someone would say that it&apos;s *too* sweet as well; it&apos;s just a matter of preference. My friend ordered the Flo Style and enjoyed it -- she was hoping for more tortillas, but I assume you can ask for extra if that&apos;s something you want. Overall they offer a great mix of sweet and savory (and even a category called &quot;lunchish&quot;) options!

The restaurant itself is really cute and buzzing with energy. If you have to wait for a table, you can pour your own coffee while standing at the front (not complimentary but still convenient!). I put us on the Yelp waitlist just in case, but it also didn&apos;t seem like the wait would have been long otherwise, and that was at 12:30 on a Saturday. But I would think it helps a lot if you&apos;re coming here with a larger group."
5,So so tasty and good! We went for brunch and were able to sit outside which was nice. The chorizo scramble was amazing and the hot sauce was great! Loved the peach Bellini.
5,"I feel Flo&apos;s is one of the top breakfast places in West Town. I&apos;ve been eating here for 15 years and I&apos;ve never walked out not happy. They make great drinks and the food is fantastic. All of the employees are very friendly and out going. I couldn&apos;t ask for a better neighborhood place .

4,"I used to walk by this place a lot and notice the hustle and bustle of people around it, but never had the chance to eat here until this summer. We had friends coming into town and we wanted a place that was local with some great brunch options.

Although we couldn&apos;t make a reservation, we were able to get on the wait list through yelp, which was really convenient because by the time we showed up our table was ready! The service was great and the staff was friendly. Everyone at our table was super happy with their meal and the portions were good sized as well. 

They have options of some boozy brunch drinks (which are absolutely delicious) but they also have an AWESOME kale smoothie. We were able to eat outside in the sunshine and it was delightful. Also it was convenient since we had a baby with us, and we were able to pull the stroller right up to the table. I haven&apos;t been there this fall, but am planning on going back soon!"
4,"Come here for some hearty New Mexican brunch at a great price! When I first looked at the menu, I had the hardest time making a decision because everything sounded amazing. In the end, I opted for the Chorizo Tamale Hash and was not disappointed. But my group tried a bunch of items and everything was good. 

During peak brunch hours, this place definitely fills up, so I recommend coming early if you can, or joining the Yelp Waitlist in advance."
4,"Check yelp to see if there is a wait list and if there is then join the waitlist online so you don&apos;t have to wait as long! Came in for weekend brunch and ordered the Triple Berry-Zabaione French Toast ($9). I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the Zabaione sauce and could have done with less of it. There was a good amount of berry, but by the end the juices did make my toast a little soggy, given I am a slower eater. Vibes were great, a lot of people were there and more were waiting by the time we left. 

One tiny downside, our waiter made us feel like she was rushing us out, even though there were bigger open tables."
4,"All things considered, Flo rounds out my Top 3 favorite breakfast restaurants in the city. As with many Chicago brunches there&apos;s a Mexican flare to the menu. I&apos;ve enjoyed every item I&apos;ve tried particularly the Fruity Pebbles French Toast and the Chorizo Tamale Hash. Surprisingly the French Toast isn&apos;t overly sweet.

They don&apos;t offer Bottomless Mimosas, but the individual glasses are pretty good (hibiscus is best). Service is always friendly. This place is always packed, so there may be a short wait. They do a nice job of turning over tables quickly.

I left off a star for not having bottomless mimosas and while always good it&apos;s not consistently great. Check em out and let me know what you think."
5,Food is always incredible but these folks went above and beyond for me last weekend. I ordered pick up and unfortunately my car got stuck in the snow on the way there. After trying to deal with that for over an hour I called them just to put our order in the fridge so I could try and get it later. They were closing soon and ended up having one of their staff drop it off at my place on their way home. So nice of them to accommodate me on such a crappy weather day!
5,"Came here for dinner during the week. They had indoor &amp; outdoor seating options, all spaced out nicely. Staff was friendly and accommodating to requests. We got a pitcher of sangria, an Elote to start with and then got the burger &amp; burrito for our meal. Food was 10/10. We intend to go back &amp; try everything on the menu!"
5,"I highly recommend using the &quot;waitlist&quot; function on Yelp if you&apos;re coming in during a busy time. My friend got us on the waitlist before we came here for Sunday brunch, and we were seated immediately despite were other people waiting for a table.

The atmosphere is casual and informal, and it seems like a great place to chill with friends or family over some great Mexican-inspired brunch food. 

I ordered the kale smoothie, which the menu describes as the &quot;perfect hangover cure,&quot; and it was indeed an accurate description. How green it was scared me a little bit at first, but despite the color, it was refreshing and sweet. For food, I ordered the smothered burrito, which came out with a side of awesomely seasoned potatoes. The burrito was also delicious, and the portion was pretty big that I had leftovers for dinner later."
5,"Been here for brunch a few times and it is always packed with people. The service is great and we must get lucky because even with a line as 2 people we always get seated at bar or on a table immediately. The venue is cute and a cool vibe. 
I&apos;ve also ordered Flo via uber eats with a more limited menu. 
My favorite food they have is the Mexican brunch. I love their chili verde chicken enchiladas and pulled pork tacos with pickled jalapeños. They have awesome bloody Mary&apos;s as well made with delicious in house hot sauces. I gotta get the chili verde one next time. They also have amazing loaded French toast. We had the chocolate and cocoa pepples with strawberries and omg soo good and so much food! 
Definitely a favorite place in the neighborhood for brunch and will be back!"
5,"Yelp Waitlist to the rescue again! A group of friends and I were struggling to agree on a central point for us to meet for brunch on Sunday, and Flo happened to be the perfect solution. And wow was their food delicious! 

We joined the Waitlist on our way over, and when we arrived, our group of friends has already checked in and was seated. How amazing! Flo&apos;s menu is expansive, with a wide range of sweet and savory options. I was teetering between a few menu items, and made a last second decision to take the huevos rancheros, and boy was I glad I did! The red chili sauce was fantastic, it had a hint of spice, yet did not overpower the other flavors in the dish. I added chicken which paired nicely with the other ingredients and flavors. The eggs were served over easy and oozed into the beans and chili sauce, which scooped up perfectly in the warm tortilla on the side. 

We also ordered the bacon chocolate chip pancakes for the table, and they were heavenly. Loaded with melted chocolate chips, it was the perfect sweet end to an amazing brunch. The service was also attentive and my coffee never ran dry. We sat at a cozy table in the back which made for easy conversation and a great time! Definitely adding Flo to my regular brunch rotation spots."
4,"Nice brunch place! Great indoor and outdoor seating selections. 

The smoothies were okay in my opinion- kinda small for the price but still okay! (I wouldn&apos;t get it again though haha but that&apos;s just me) 

I had the burrito and I don&apos;t know what&apos;s in the sauce they put on top of it but it was delicious! If you look at my photo...do you see the size of that thing? I ate all of it. I liked it that much. The only downside was that my boyfriend&apos;s dish came a little burnt. 

But overall- great prices, good tasting food, nice staff, and yuuuuuge (why do I always hear this in Donald Trump&apos;s voice?) portions!"
3,"Ever since I heard about the fruity pebbles French toast, Flo has been on my list of places to go to. When we ordered it though, it was way too sweet, especially for breakfast, and this is coming from a girl with a sweet tooth!! The idea of it sounds yummy but in actuality, even not thinking about the sweetness level, the dish was pretty average and I was pretty disappointed."
