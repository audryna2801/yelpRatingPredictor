5,"I biked up to Tank Noodle over the summer to try some of the Pho I have heard so much about.  I was planning on getting it to go, but once I arrived, I saw a little patio set up and wanted to sit and eat.

In addition to the Pho, I got some spring rolls and a combination plate.  While the service on the patio wasn&apos;t terrific, I absolutely loved the food.  The springs rolls were really good, and I could eat the sauce they served it with by the spoon.  The pho is light and refreshing.  And the combination plate had a few different meats on it with some rice and vegetables.  All in all, really enjoyed all 3 dishes and would recommend it to anyone who likes Vietnamese food."
5,"Just as great as I&apos;ve heard! Took a drive up to Argyle because you know, there is nothing to do anymore so the highlight of the weekend was driving to a new neighborhood, walking around a bit, and snagging some take out. Anyway, we ordered the pho but with veggies and asked what the waitress recommended. She said the combo vermicelli so we ordered that too. Got a watermelon, lychee boba tea and waited for the food. That boba tea was incredible. Like so upset we didn&apos;t get two. Fresh fruit with a creamy liquid...yum! 

Pho was very good, I&apos;m sure better if it wasn&apos;t take out. The noodles were pretty sticky but the mixed veggies were good, soo many bean sprouts and basil, perfect amount of lime and spicy sauce packets to go. I was super happy, and my picture only shows half. 

The combo plate was incredible-- hats off to that waitress. The egg roll was crispy and amazing, beef was smoky and that sausage!! Wow! Could have done without the shrimp but would get this again in a heart beat. 

Looking forward to coming back when the works is semi normal!!"
5,"I live in the neighborhood, so I&apos;ve been going to Tank for awhile. I&apos;m so thankful I&apos;m now able to get Tank food delivered just a few blocks away quickly and safely!

My favorites are the pho, the eggrolls, and the spring rolls, but honestly, I haven&apos;t had a bad thing yet! Even for delivery, the quality is great, and the sauces are awesome. I have had good luck with delivery pho, as the components are separated, so I can heat the broth a little bit on the stove, and the pour it over the rare steak and noodles, then sprinkling on all the accoutrements and sauces, and it&apos;s so good, even at home. It&apos;s enough food that I can usually get an appetizer, divide the pho into two portions, and have plenty for multiple meals.

I also love that they live their best life and just close for vacation sometimes. I miss them when they&apos;re gone, but I&apos;m so thrilled they take a long break regularly!"
1,"Do not eat here. The owners went to jan 6 insurrection and also do not pay their workers a fare wage. See article below for more info.

Also the food is bad. Better places around the area.

This was a go-to favorite for a long time, but cheap and  tasty does not cover wage theft. Crime food tastes bad."
1,"Mediocre food and terrible owners. The owners of Tank not only bragged about attending the January 6 Trump coup attempt, they have also stiffed their employees and were ordered to pay $700K in fines to the hard working servers they have screwed for years.

But hey? Maybe you don&apos;t care about human decency or democratic prinicples. The food here is bland as hell. The place across the street is better and less expensive! Bonus points to them for paying their workers.

Tank Noodle more like no thanks noodle."
1,"Just read this Department of Labor notification that they did not pay their employees to the tune of  $697,295. That is so sad and not a place I would visit EVER. Pay humans for their work, please.

1,"These peoples payment option sucks and was always shady to me. Now we find out they haven&apos;t been paying their employees right and ordered to pay over 700,000 in back fees. Make long your employees just work on tips and not pay them minimum wage is trash to me. Won&apos;t be eating here anymore. Very disappointing"
1,"The food is marginal, the tables are dirty, and they violate federal employment laws. Why on earth would ANYONE support this business?"
1,"If you don&apos;t mind patronizing a business that callously does not follow Federal Labor laws and does not pay its staff an hourly wage but instead has them working for tips only,  which at the end of the day, they still have to split with management..then I hope you dont mind eating knowing how bad they exploit their staff."
1,"Reposting because Yelp editors deleted my review because they felt it was about Tank Noodle&apos;s participation in the Capitol insurrection, and about their encouraging violence on social media.

In fact, this review is not at all about that. It&apos;s about how I ate at Tank Noodle and about how mediocre their food is. I ate their pho and bahn mi sandwiches; they were both bland compared to more authentic offerings in the neighborhood. Reflecting back on my recent visit only brings feelings of disgust and nausea. I&apos;ll never step foot in their establishment again."
1,"Not a fan.  While the menu selection is huge, that is about all the place has going for it.  The staff isn&apos;t all that friendly, food is mediocre at best and they do not follow COVID protocol well.  Much better Vietnamese options in our great city!"
1,Do not support businesses that do not pay their employees a fair wage and incite violence. There are so many spots in Chicago in which you can get better food.  The owners of this establishment were at the January 6th insurrection in DC. When a popular establishment takes the time to go and do things like this but can not pay a livable wage to their employees it speaks volumes. Do better. Be better
1,"As someone who spent a lot of time exploring pho shops in Southern California, I know my way around a bowl of pho. The quality of food here is mediocre at best. It&apos;s highway robbery what they charge."
2,"Food is nothing special, there are multiple businesses nearby with similar offerings. There are two places on the same block that have good pho. The other businesses don&apos;t have owners that illegally under paid their workers and used that money to fly during a pandemic to an insurrection agaisnt the United States. I will never go here again since there really is no reason to."
1,Search for yourself. The owners were Cited for labor law violations. Ordered 700K -backed pay.
1,Don&apos;t waste your time on miserable food. MUCH better places basically anywhere in Chicago.
1,"I just had a question; did you not pay your employees, because you spent all their wages at the Trump Rally?"
1,"Fuck this place. The owners taking part in the January 6th Trump rally, ending in an extremist attack on the Capitol, enough to put you off? How about the fact that they haven&apos;t been paying their workers, to the tune of $700K? Or had servers work for tips only? Seriously, go to any of the dozen better Vietnamese places nearby."
2,Their pho has gone downhill and the broth has lost a lot of its flavor. The meat they serve has gotten tougher even when you simmer it for awhile. They used to be good but with all their controversy with their participation in the DC riots and now not even paying their servers at all their food has suffered somewhat.
