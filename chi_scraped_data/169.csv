5,"I recieved a $20 lunch stipend from work today and it was just enough for 18 delish steamed beef and coriander dumplings from Qing Xiang Yuan.

I ordered for pick up and I am amazed by how well put together plastic minimizing packaging that was used to present the food. Everything is recyclable.

I can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,"Delicious dumplings served right to your door! 

First, the packaging is impeccable and everything has a place. It made take out an experience. 

The dumplings are very flavorful and don&apos;t need a ton of sauce (which is good because you only get a soy sauce/black vinegar mix no spicy oil despite asking for it).

Like others have said, the seared upgrade is lacking and hardly noticeable to see one side cooked a bit more. I wish this were a true seared option. 

Neither the lack of spicy sauce or light sear would drop this place a star. The dumplings are really the star of the show. 

We got the pork and cabbage along with lamb and coriander and they were both very delicious."
5,"A high 4.5 stars to this heaven of dumplings. A wide variety of choices and wonderful selection makes it a go-to spot in chinatown of Chicago. I ordered delivery from this place.

Food order: Lamb Coriander dumplings, Chicken and mushroom dumplings, and pork and cabbage dumplings.

The lamb coriander dumplings (we ordered pan fried), had well seasoned meat, good texture, and meat was easy to chew. The dumplings could have used more coriander to balance the taste of lamb. Overall, good set of dumplings.

The Chicken and mushroom dumplings (we ordered steamed) were again well seasoned, soupy, and had a nice texture. When you chew on these dumplings, you could see the juices spiraling from the dumpling. Great taste. One of my favorites.

The pork and cabbage (pan fried) were great as well. A bit on the salty side but the nature of the meat combined with sourness of the cabbage had that effect. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was fresh and well cooked, but not my go-to order.

The only thing I would add is I would like the pan fried dumplings to be more fried rather than just a touch of sear. A bit more crispiness would make it amazing!

Will order from here again, definitely one of the best in chicago.

P.S. Great packing and presentation! Extra points for that! Food integrity is crucial in these pandemic times, so thank you!!"
5,"I was told that this place only accepts reservations and when I tried to reserve for a seat for 2 this place was booked and didn&apos;t have any seating till 3 days later on their website. We ended up just showing up in person anyways since we happened to be in the area, and they let us be seated immediately since it wasn&apos;t full at all. We decided to order the lamb and cumin dumplings and pork and leek. The pork and leek tasted like classic dumplings flavors, but the lamb was so unique ! I loved it mostly because I love the taste of lamb in general. It was very juicy and full of flavor. Overall I would come back and order more lamb dumplings for sure."
5,"Not only are these the best soup dumplings in Chicago, they&apos;re the best I&apos;ve ever had. Our go-to order is a mix of steamed lamb and coriander dumplings and pork and cabbage dumplings. They also have a variety of delicious appetizers and veggie dumplings, plus the restaurant is BYOB! Highly recommend dipping the dumplings in the chili oil-vinegar mix for an extra kick. Note that it can get very busy. Love this place!"
5,"We dined in on a Friday night for two. It was a very busy night! We had 8 groups in front of us and it took us about 1 hour and 15 minutes to get a table, but the system they used was great because we could type in our phone number and go for a walk until we received a text knowing our seat was ready. 

Once we received our table, the setup was clean and organized. We received disinfectant wash cloths for our hands. Everyone working there would wear face masks and our waiter had protective gloves on. 

We only tried two orders of the tofu, cabbage and mushroom dumplings. We heard this was an excellent place to go, and we weren&apos;t disappointed by the dumplings. The dumplings were tasty and juicy and warm -- if you&apos;re in Chicago, you must try these dumplings at least once. 

While we would&apos;ve liked to see a wider variety of appetizers and drinks, I think it makes sense for the restaurant&apos;s location and the fact that they literally specialize in dumplings. 

The waiters were friendly. 

No public restrooms, so take that in mind! 

Overall, great dinner. Would come back again during a less busy time."
3,"This is more of a 3.5 star review. My sister had this on her list of places to eat so we gave it a try. The main focus here is dumplings so that is what we ordered. 

We got: pan fried lamb dumplings, mackerel steamed dumplings and pork/cabbage steamed dumplings. All the dumplings had soup in them which made them juicy and very yummy. However, the pan fried one wasn&apos;t fried enough so they had similar texture to the steamed dumplings. 

Service was good, but almost borderline too much. They were coming at our table every 5 minutes or so to do something and it was a little too much for me. Price was on par with Ding tai fung."
5,"The pandemic has lead me to seek out new food experiences. Hands down, the soup dumplings offered by QXY have been my favorite. Absolutely delicious. I&apos;ve already ordered 3 times,  and I take great comfort knowing I always have these amazing dumplings in my freezer."
4,"QXY does a lot of things well, which makes them a standout in Chinatown. The dumplings are made quite well and there&apos;s a wide array of protein and meatless options to suit everyone&apos;s tastes. My top choices are the lamb and coriander and beef and onion, but I&apos;ve also had the vegetarian dumplings and was pleasantly surprised by how tasty/how much texture they had. Having grown up in Asia, I don&apos;t think the dumplings here are mindblowingly good, but they are by far the best in Chicago, and you can definitely taste the difference in these freshly made dumplings vs grocery store or homemade ones. The appetizers here are also a standout, and I especially love the pig ear and peanuts with celery. 

Interior design and service are also top notch. However, the prices are not necessarily cheap. I usually spend ~$20-30 per person since each person needs at least 18 dumplings to actually be full. 

During normal times, there&apos;s always a wait so I would highly recommend putting in an online reservation prior to coming. Now during the pandemic, the tables are nicely socially distanced but there is no outdoor dining."
5,"Man...my boyfriend and I have been searching for a new soup dumpling place after having a bad experience with our last go-to spot...and this place is now our official spot!!! This is the first time we tried them panfried...delish!!

We had the pork &amp; cabbage (steamed), beef &amp; onion (panfried) and lamb kabobs! Everything was satisfyingly delicious!  The service was great - very helpful and our food arrived quickly. We will definitely be back!"
4,"We came here for lunch. A nice clean restaurant. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. They even opened the door for us and invited us right in and had a choose any seat we wanted. 

We came here just for dumplings. We ordered 12 steamed pork &amp; cabbage and 12 pan fried lamb &amp; coriander. When we ordered the pan fried ones, our server stated it would be 30 minutes before they were ready and to be honest, it wasn&apos;t worth the wait. I&apos;ve had better pan fried dumplings, but the steamed pork &amp; cabbage were really tasty. The lamb &amp; coriander tasted good on the inside, but I didn&apos;t like the way they were pan fried. Felt like it needed a little bit more frying. 

The tables all have, soy sauce, chili sauce and vinegar. Wasn&apos;t a big fan of the vinegar and I&apos;m used to soy sauce so just stick with the chili sauce and soy sauce. The chili sauce gives the dumplings extra flavor that is worth trying. 

Will definitely be back to try out some more of their dumplings. Will probably get two 18 pieces instead of two 12 pieces to get a little bit more full."
5,"Super tasty dumplings! Will definitely be back.

No windows that I noticed in the restaurant but they did spread the tables out and strategically place people around so it was as covid safe as it could be. Just order a small portion of the pan-fried pork and cabbage soup dumplings. Very tasty and well crisped. 

As a heads up, these are not the traditional Shanghai style soup dumplings. These were more like potstickers with some juices inside. Very flavorful though I&apos;d consider it a new take on a regular dumpling vs. a soup dumpling."
5,"This review is for pick-up. We ordered online from their site and picked up about 30 mins after. They notify you via text and pick up was super easy. We asked for extra dipping sauce and they delivered with about 10 containers. We&apos;d heard from friends that the appetizers were not worth it so we stuck to dumplings. We tried both steamed and pan fried and honestly it&apos;s hard to pick a fav, but steamed probably comes out on top.
1) pork and dill, steamed - my favorite 
1) pork, shrimp, and leek, pan fried- really good but the others outshined
2) beef and coriander (cilantro), pan fried - the bf&apos;s favorite
3) beef and celery, steamed - also amazing, the crunch of the celery was great

They&apos;re only selling 18-piece dumpling orders, fyi, so we had a lot leftover but their packaging makes it super easy to store and reheat. We&apos;ll probably reheat in the air fryer but the containers are microwave safe too. As you can read, we loved it all and will be ordering again soon."
5,"I adore this place. One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! The dumplings are always freshly made and you can actually see them making it through the glass panel in the back. The decor is clean, modern,  and cozy with traditional elements. I absolutely love their pan fried beef and onion dumplings as well as chicken and coriander dumplings. Highly recommend giving this place a try! Currently (due to covid) you have to make reservations online in advance to come in."
5,"We love Qing Xiang yuan dumplings! Their carry out packaging is amazing. It is securely placed in their own compartment- much better than before! 

We always get their beef &amp; onion and beef &amp; coriander. You cannot go wrong with either pan fried or steamed."
5,"Probably one of the best new restaurants coming out of Chinatown in years. They carefully curate and care for the quality of dine-in, take-out, and delivery with amazing attention to details. Vegetarian? Come here. Not Vegetarian? Come here. This is truly authentic high quality dumplings. 

LAMB AND CORIANDER: Fan of lamb? Go for it. You can&apos;t go wrong here. It&apos;s a snappy bite into a lamb dumpling (which I&apos;ve never had before this place) and they set a new standard. 
SHRIMP, PORK AND LEEK: A classic dumpling, go for it. 
ZUCCHINI, VERMICELLI AND WOOD EAR MUSHROOM: Wow, I&apos;m not a vegetarian but my friend ordered this and I was blown away. Extremely clean, flavorful. Oh yeah, get it pan fried for an extra crisp! 

Appetizers:
PIG EARS W. CHILI OIL: I was not expecting to like this (given its name) It&apos;s a smooth, gelatin-like consistency with a decent chew and snap to it. If you like a small kick in your palette, the chili oil is absolutely phenomenal. It&apos;s worth a try. 
WOOD EAR MUSHROOM SALAD: Can&apos;t go wrong with wood ear mushrooms. If you like mushrooms, get this. 
LAMB KEBAB - Flavorful, tender, lamb. If you like cumin flavor, this is heavy on it."
2,"Meh... okay.  Very processed &quot;dumplings&quot; that were previously frozen and quickly re-heated.  
Small dumplings, lacking juice and flavor.  Never again."
5,"Originally we had planned on ordering take-out. But because only 2 parties of 4 people were there we decided to stay. Ann (not sure if I&apos;m spelling it correctly) our waitress asked us if we were sure we wanted to order takeout.  I immediately, felt more at ease since it wasn&apos;t busy and I realized how clean and spaced out the tables were.  I had seen the staff clean out the tables after some patrons left. I also liked how quaint it was. She recommended a reservation for next time but because there weren&apos;t many people we were free to drop in. She told us to sit at a table towards the back making sure we had plenty of space between other patrons. She was very friendly, patient, and attentive towards us. I really appreciated her knowledge and hospitality because it was our first time. She gave us a few pointers on how to use the chili and vinegar and explained a few things on the menu for us. Our appetizer was a seaweed salad. Delicious and just like she had mentioned it was unlike the Japanese style that has thinner seaweed. I ordered the lamb and coriander dumplings pan fried and they were delicious. They are medium size but come in sets of either 12 or 18. I was so impressed with how fresh they were that I decided to order some to go.  When we were ready to leave she boxed all of our leftovers up so meticulously to make sure we got everything, even my tea with fresh leaves.  She said I could add more hot water since she made sure to put the tea leaves in there. I had a very pleasant experience. The food was delicious. The staff was great and everything was so clean. I appreciate how everything was sustainable. Hardly any plastic was used, we had wooden chopsticks + hand sanitizing towelettes in my take-out order. I would definitely go back again and would recommend it to my friends."
4,"The quality of food here is just as good as it has always been! However, I have one small gripe I wanted to call to attention.

There is a waitress that works here (East European? woman) who is very friendly but continues to insist that we order dumplings boiled. I understand that she may genuinely believe this is true, but I have had this happen to me no less than 3 times on separate occasions. Typically, we&apos;ll place our order for steamed and pan-fried dumplings, to which she&apos;ll say &quot;XYZ (beef/onion, pork/shrimp, choose your filling) is much better boiled&quot; and give you a disapproving look if you don&apos;t change your mind. This borders on passive-aggressive. The first few times I actually did change my order to boiled dumplings, but learned I preferred the steamed and pan-fried versions of these (juicier on the inside!) So no, I would not like to have my dumplings boiled. 

I considered docking a star on my updated review because this waitress&apos;s insistence honestly negatively affects my experience here and is a reason for me to want to go elsewhere when deciding where to eat in Chinatown, but overall the workers here are very friendly and respectful. I hope that the owners of QXY will see this and bring this to her attention, just for her own awareness!"
5,"I came here with my sister in laws and a bunch of other ladies for a weekend getaway. We were looking for good authentic Chinese place to eat and found this spot. Most of the reviews online were pretty positive and there&apos;s quite a hype about it, so we decided to come try out this place. 

This was a nice little quiet dumpling spot in Chinatown. It&apos;s filled with Bamboo decor and again. Quiet. Too quiet that people can actually hear you have conversations and slurp your dumpling. We ordered the pork and cabbage, shrimp, and beef. The pork and cabbage was the best. No wonder why this place is so quiet! Everyone&apos;s FOCUSED on their dumplings and they&apos;re super serious about it. No one was taking the entire time my group and I were there because they were pretty busy eating delicious dumplings. This has got to be one of the best and authentic dumping restaurant in the area. 

Service was great. They took our orders using an iPad. Food was awesome, we finished all the food. Ambiance was nice and relaxing. Would definitely come back again!"
