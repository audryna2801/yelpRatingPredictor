4,"I&apos;ve ordered from Pequod&apos;s a couple times in the past, it has been a couple years since our last experience so we ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza for carry out, The pies are good, toppings and cheese are flavorful and the crust works well. The only downside to me is that it&apos;s a bit on the doughy side and the ratio of cheese to bread is off to me. You get a largely thick layer of bread as the base, with a thin spread of cheese and toppings. Overall, still a decent pie, but there are other venues in the Chicago area that are better. 


Best,

5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
5,"If you think you have had the BEST deep dish pizza and you haven&apos;t eaten at Pequod&apos;s... then simply said you haven&apos;t had the BEST deep dish pizza.

Hands down the BEST!! An amazing food experience in Chi Town. A must go to if you are in the Windy City... So let it be said, So let it be EATEN"
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"Ive been to this place twice and I can say this is the best pizza joint I&apos;ve had in the Chicago area AND that is of my many , many pizza parlor stops. I would suggest a thin crust pizza with  
Pepperoni, sausage, fresh garlic,giafdinera peppers. AMAZING!"
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,I thought that Lou Malnati had the deep dish pizza in the bag. I was completely astounded by how good this place was. The toppings were everywhere! I loved how many toppings they give you and I love that they put them on top of the pizza as well. Run don&apos;t walk!
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
2,yeah idk much about chicago deep dish but why was this pizza so much bread !!! like imagine a piece of bread with sauce on it lol. i was impressed w the caramelized (?) crust and the sauce was yummy and garlicky which i liked . some soup collected on the top but i think that was a product of taking the pizza to go (thx covid). toppings are expensive so we had to be gentle w those. also we definitely went into the pizza starving and we were full after 1 slice each. get the large if you have 6 or 7 mouths to feed. 3 ppl could not grt theu more than half.
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
5,"Ok so I have lived Chicago most of my with the exception of a four year stint in KS for college and for the life of me I do not know why I&apos;ve never heard of Peaquods. It wasn&apos;t until I watched a show on Netflix did I ever hear the name. So once I saw it I told my wife immediately we have to go check it out. I have grown up eating deep dish pizza and the Original Unos on Ohio and Grand has been a staple in my families life since I was a kid. Not the franchise restaurants only the original. So I am team Original Unos through and through. That&apos;s until now..... I am completely torn.. Until now no one has competed, none have come close.  Peaquods deep dish is so damn good from top to bottom but the kicker is the crust and the crispy cheese edge... Holy S%#t!!!!!! Is about all I can say. Every bite was a experience and I promise I was pissed that my piece was gone. I didn&apos;t want to over eat so we wrapped the rest to go. I warmed it up the next morning and relived the experience all over again. There is nothing fancy about the place. All the social distancing precautions were in place. But one thing every table had in common is that they were all smiling and having a great time. The staff was attentive and engaging which made it even better. Thanks Peaquods for a great night out and we look forward to seeing you again."
4,"Delicious Deep-Fish Pizza! Greeter is nice as well as the servers! Even a slice from a medium size pizza was filling, so worth the money!!"
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
