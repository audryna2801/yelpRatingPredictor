5,"Much like the rest of the world, we weren&apos;t able to experience much travel this year. In fact we only traveled to one place, which was Chicago back in August.

While there, we wanted to experience a restaurant that had a good variety of food for the whole family, including vegan options for me. We happened upon True Food Kitchen, and boy am I glad we did!

First, let&apos;s talk safety. Since we&apos;re in the middle of a global pandemic, safety was just as important to us along with how the food and service was. True Food Kitchen took great safety precautions and offered indoors, outdoors or combo indoor/outdoor seating. We chose indoor seating and felt very comfortable. They only used every other table, and on the tables not being used was a big bottle of hand sanitizer. Masks had to be worn when you weren&apos;t at your table and instead of regular menus, they table had QR code&apos;s.

Let&apos;s talk food... YUM! Although the menu isn&apos;t super large, it did have a good variety of regular, vegetarian and vegan foods. Their foods are fresh with fresh ingredients and everyone of us was satisfied! My husband felt like the food was a little pricey, but I feel like we got our money&apos;s worth.

Whenever we make it back to Chicago, I&apos;ll definitely grab another bowl of vegan yumminess from True Food Kitchen!! The food, staff and vibe of the whole place was spot on!"
5,"2nd times a charm. After Brien, the manager reached out my husband and I decided to take the offer to return and give True Food Kitchen another try. We haven&apos;t eaten in any other restaurant since the pandemic began so we cannot compare service changes to other restaurants but we appreciated their new menu system with ordering on our phones. The online system includes photos of each menu item which we found very helpful compared to our previous experience, for example last time my husband ordered tacos without knowing the meal only included 2, now with the photo you can see this and he said he would have not ordered the tacos.

We ordered an appetizer to share. I ordered soup and a salad with tofu and my husband ordered a pizza. Everything was tasty although the tofu is a side of large cubes and didn&apos;t seem to be seasoned which was disappointing since it would have been more flavorful cooked with the dish.

They had these wonderful chips they make there which came with our appetizer, edamame guacamole and I put them in my butternut squash soup too they were so yummy!  

Our server was friendly and they have heat lamps set up to help keep guests warm.

We will be happy to return!"
5,"Love this place! I always find myself in a True Food Kitchen, when I travel for business or pleasure and they never disappoint; from LA to Vegas from Houston to Chicago! I love this place.

Since this was my first time here during COVID; I believe the staff handled each patron with care from the wearing of mask to the sanitization of the tables! Well done, True Food Kitchen.

Now for the food; you can never go wrong with an Ancient Grain Bowl with Salmon; I don&apos;t know what it is but this one was extra delicious lol! It may be because I haven&apos;t had it in a while. 

Worth every penny and definitely worth a visit. 

Cheers,"
3,"The food I had last night was really delicious. Why 3 stars, you ask? 

First, I ordered meals for myself and two friends at 2pm yesterday, with a 6:15pm requested delivery time. With that amount of advanced notice, I was surprised when the order arrived one hour late. 

Second, the food was lukewarm at best. Ew.

Third, the cost/value. All three of us ordered the winter immunity bowl. (Again, it was quite delicious.) But for $15 without meat on it, one would expect a bowl that would at least fill you up. I&apos;m a fairly small human, and generally have leftovers with whatever I order. Not this time, my friends. Portion size was WAY to small for the cost. 

If I were rating based on yummy flavor and quality ingredients, this would be a 5 star review. But for the reasons above, I&apos;m going to have to chop True Food from my list of restaurants to support."
4,"Came here for brunch with a friend who is vegan as she recommended due to the fact she absolutely loves this place. We came on a nice Saturday morning 30 mins after they opened to ensure we got table not too close to others...social distancing. The place is very clean and very green...loved the look of it and it is a nice size. 

We wound up with a very nice server...I hate that I do not recall her name, but she was cool. Broke down the best menu items and told us how to place the order online as well as paying for the bill online which was all very easy. She recommended a very good brunch cocktail which is called A is for Apples which is a mimosa using champagne (of course), apple juice, simple syrup and lemon. Very good cocktail and went down fast and easy....did 2 of em. 

I wound up getting the Egg &amp; Chicken Sausage sandwich that was delicious along with a side of sweet potato hash. My friend got the Butternut Squash Pizza which was very good as well. I was shocked that she smashed the whole pizza but that tells you it was pretty damn good! Great food, drinks, staff and location...cant beat that and not many places can say that!"
1,"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY THROUGH THEIR WEBSITE 

It&apos;s delivered through post mates or DoorDash anyways and their promo codes don&apos;t work. You might as well keep the delivery within your preferred delivery apps control than use their tracking link.

We had an awful delivery experience. The delivery took 40 minutes to travel .5 miles, and it was cold by the time it arrived. They also forgot to include an item but I was sick of dealing with their apathetic customer service to try and get a refund for the missing item. 

Also their kale was a gritty mess."
3,"The Spaghetti squash came with a fresh tomato marinara sauce and nice mozzarella cheese. It was delicious. We also ordered Brussels sprouts, Charred cauliflower, and cocktails which were good, but not anything special."
4,"I came here for a birthday dinner and the patio is beautiful! It&apos;s open and well spaced out. They also accept reservations for specifically the patio which is different (and good!) compared to other restaurants.

My party got 2 appetizers, the edamame guac and the jackfruit lettuce wraps. I liked the spice and combo of edamame and avocado, but others in my party thought the 2 weren&apos;t the best combo. But good all in all. The jackfruit wraps were also a split - the marinade was delicious and the mushrooms marinated were a big hit. There were some people who like and some who didn&apos;t the jackfruit. I personally liked it but it had an interesting texture. 

For my main, I got the seasonal salad with tofu. I really like the aleppo chili! So spicy and yum. The asparagus was also delicious - fennel was interesting. Not bad but maybe not my favorite? the tofu was also kind of plain. Again, not bad but not unique.

4 stars overall because biggg plus for the ambiance but the food itself was good but not great. I thought every dish could have been better."
5,"An absolutely refreshingly beautiful bite. There is a special freshness about the food here; original, organic and authentic. I have eaten here a few times and always get the same thing; ancient grains bowl. Miso and sesame glazed sweet potatoes with tumeric, onions, snap peas and portobello mushrooms served over brown rice and farrow with a side of avocado. I also grab a &apos;spa&apos; water: cucumber slice, lemon slice, lime slice and mint sprigs!"
4,"This place is doing a good job of serving up healthy food that&apos;s also pretty delicious. Some of the menu items are better than others; I like the turkey burger and the chicken wrap, but the kale Caesar salad was boring after about 5 bites, it being mostly a big bowl of kale with some dressing, Parmesan and itty bitty croutons that resembled crumbs more than anything else. They offer seasonal salads which are usually worth getting, and a good value as a salad main dish. I&apos;ve had the sweet potatoes when they&apos;re not cooked through, so some attention on the line for simple errors like that would help. I&apos;ve had the  tomato soup on a few occasions, and it&apos;s always good. I appreciate that they&apos;re open for to go and delivery during these days of COVID-19, as I&apos;ve ordered lunch and picked it up numerous times. Truly a good place to have in the neighborhood."
3,"3.49 stars. I like the concept, but the food is lacking flavor and the items are 10-15% overpriced. I understand fresh quality ingredients come at a premium, I still don&apos;t think these prices are justified. 

The items that come closest to meeting expectation are the Spaghetti Squash Casserole and the Lasagna Bolognese. I haven&apos;t tried too many of their cocktails, but there&apos;s a full bar. Service has always been great. It they boost the flavors with more garlic and spice while executing, I can easily see 4 stars."
4,"I love this place!! There are so many healthy, vegan options BUT even omnivores will find something they love. Great for big parties because there is SO MUCH SPACE inside, so it&apos;s always pretty easy to get a table/reservation. My favorite dishes are the 1) ancient grains bowl 2) seasonal ingredient winter salad 3) grilled sustainable salad (the cilantro pumpkin seed pesto is AMAZING!!!) 4) the charred cauliflower appetizer  

It can get a bit expensive, but the food is super fresh/healthy, so you&apos;re paying for high-quality ingredients. Also, the service can be slightly slower - especially after they give you the food, the servers often stop filling up water."
4,"If you want healthier options with a good outdoor area this place is great. I got the turkey burger and chips and it was good and my girlfriend got the Teriyaki quinoa  bowl which she liked a lot. 

I was between 4 and 5 stars but the reason I went with 4 is because I wasn&apos;t blown away. Definitely a great spot to get food during the week and have a couple glasses of wine with a lot of healthier options on the menu. 

The bright spot of our dinner was the waitress. I forget her name at this time but she was so sweet, nice, and had the best attitude. Gave her a 25% tip because of how friendly she was. 

Highly recommend for a casual dinner spot."
5,"Went to this place for a business lunch when they found out I was vegan! It&apos;s so veggie forward and lovely. I got the ancient grains bowl plus tofu and it tastes incredible! We also got the butternut squash pizza and it was the BEST I&apos;ve ever had. Never thought I&apos;d like squash on pizza that much but I&apos;ve been won over. Lastly their staff is very aware of diets. When I asked if this banana date smoothie was vegan they said it wasn&apos;t due to honey but they could make it without just for me! Really those special touches that matter. 
Additionally their straws are 100% biodegradable which I loved.

5,"This is my go to spot so I&apos;m not sure why it&apos;s taken me so long to write a review about how amazing it is! Everything here is made in house with organic and local resources, so all very healthy and fresh. There is a ton of vegan and gluten free options that are nicely marked on the menu and the menu changes seasonally but not completely just a few additions here and there. 

Some of my favorite things:

Matcha horchata: matcha latte with oat milk and vanilla- out of this world good and I will continue to try and make it home and fail miserably haha

Edamme dumplings: these are the best thing ever and I order them every single time I come here- trust me on this one. They are in a light truffle broth that I could literally drink and paired with fresh cilantro. 

Kale salad: with Parmesan and breadcrumbs dressed with a lemon vinegerette. I&apos;m not sure what they do to make their kale salad so magical but It&apos;s truly a simple yet delicious salad that always hits the spot. 

Teriyaki quinoa bowl: really good gluten free mean that is super healthy and satisfying. 

Egg and chicken sausage sandwich: one of the sandwiches I love for breakfast, super filling and I always sub a side of kale salad because it&apos;s the best thing ever. 

Everything here is good you really can&apos;t go wrong and it&apos;s also so fresh and healthy. This place tends to get very busy during peak times on the weekend so I recommend making a reservation!!"
5,"Come here if you want to eat great tasting food without all the guilt. True Food Kitchen pride themselves for being a healthy restaurant. They offer a variety of vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options. But carnivores, such as myself, need not fret! There are plenty of meat and seafood choices as well. Fun facts: you can also add meat to most of their dishes, and I love that they post the calories on their menu. They have a full bar and offer cocktails such as the skinny margarita, so even drinking alcohol makes you feel good inside! The wife opted for the apple gold rush (150 calories) and I had the Pom Collins (170 calories). Both were very light and refreshing.

As for food, we ordered the edamame dumplings and charred cauliflower for appetizers. Delicious! It is no wonder reviewers on Yelp rave about them. I can eat them all day! For the main dish we had the Korean noodle with shrimp added and the Thai coconut seabass. All were so tasty and flavorful. I could not stop moaning while eating. Finally, we shared the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. So glad we ordered it because it was amazing!

The only negative thing we experienced while dining here was when our waiter came around and literally dumped the two main dishes on our table while we were still eating our appetizers. He did not say a word - just turned around and left. We thought that was strange, considering he was very attentive prior to that event. We just shrugged it off, and continued to enjoy our dinner.

Do we recommend this place? Yes. Would we come back here again? Definitely. Order the same dishes? You bet!"
4,"True Food Kitchen is a great spot for a healthy eat. While the interior has a ton of seating, the establishment gets pretty packed during prime time, so I would still recommend making a reservation ahead of time.

The food here has a fresh and healthy, yet still delicious taste. They also have some cleansing drinks and interesting cocktails. I ordered the spicy panang curry with added chicken- very tasty! It also included a bowl of rice which turned out to be a good portion size for myself. The price tag for items here is a bit more on the expensive side although not outrageous.

All in all, if you are looking for a healthful place to eat, then consider checking out True Food Kitchen. If you aren&apos;t looking for something as healthy or trying to find an establishment that offers bigger portions, you might want to try elsewhere"
4,"When traveling it&apos;s great to find an establishment that offers high quality, healthy menu options. Pretty much all of True Food&apos;s menu fits that bill. From there, it&apos;s simply a matter of choosing which item best matches your tastes or craving-of-the-moment (and that&apos;s hard given that so many menu choices sound absolutely delicious).

Daughter and I stopped in for a late lunch, arriving just after 2 PM. I&apos;d totally forgotten it was a Sunday, but was reminded when we were given a &quot;brunch&quot; menu! The place was hoppin&apos;, with most tables filled; however, given the hour, it grew less crowded. Nevertheless, we were seated at an awesome window table right away and settled in to scrutinize the menu. 

Impressions on this visit:  
Atmosphere- gorgeous, vibrant interior. Bright lighting without being garish, plants, wood accents.... a lovely place to enjoy our meals.

Food / drink - just what I hoped for. Flavorful food that was also very fresh and healthful. After a tough time deciding, I selected the &quot;ancient grains bowl&quot; minus the portobello mushroom. They added additional veggies in place of the portobello. The bowl was plentiful and wonderfully prepared. The sweet potato, snow peas, and onion were not cooked to death, just perfect.  I couldn&apos;t finish the whole thing and have some leftovers to look forward to. :) Daughter (who is less health-enthused than I am) ordered the Grilled Chicken Avocado Wrap with the side cucumber salad. She was happy with her choice &amp; finished it off. The side cucumber salad also had good flavor. She also ordered the Medicine Man Refresher. She reports that it tasted good and felt really healthful.

Service - our overall service is the only reason this a 4-star, rather than a 5-star review. We were welcomed &amp; seated promptly. Our server started off great. He explained/highlighted menu options, answered questions about the refreshers, etc. But once our food was brought out (by another employee), he basically ignored us. He never came soon after our food was dropped off to make sure everything was prepared well.  I had to call him over to ask for a water refill. (Though he was walking by and glanced at our table, he didn&apos;t approach to check on us.) Later, I observed him basically chatting back by the kitchen area with fellow staff for quite a while.  He was always polite when he did interact with us, but good service also means checking on guests periodically after their food is served to see if they need anything and if their order is okay.

True Food is pricey. For the three items we ordered, plus tax/tip, the bill was around $45. But, it is downtown Chicago and the food is high quality so that&apos;s not a complete surprise. 

Overall, a positive first visit and given the quality of the food, I would return if I&apos;m back in town."
5,"This was my second takeout order from them, and I am much more impressed with their pizza than anything! I finally got vegan pizza with dairy-free cheese. There was only one on the menu, and it was almond ricotta, onions, garlic, spinach, and mushrooms. The ricotta didn&apos;t have too much flavor, but the texture was just right. Everything was flavored and paired so well, and the crust was completely amazing and perfectly cooked! The price seemed a little steep at $17 for a small/medium sized pizza, but it&apos;s so delicious that it&apos;s worth it. I&apos;d like to compare this to a traditional vegan mozzarella pizza, which I wish they had."
4,"I really really liked True Food Kitchen, but the food was just a biiiiit too unique for me to really full-on love it. 

First off, the decor here is stunning. And our server was so kind and easy-going. Looking over the menu, I loved how True Food Kitchen seems to be making healthy food both approachable and elevated. I didn&apos;t have to google five million ingredients as I read through the options, and a lot of the dishes were recognizable -- just with healthier ingredients. My favorite item? The Kale Aid juice. I&apos;m not one to drink anything green, but our server recommended it, and wow. SO. GOOD. The actual food itself was not as good as I&apos;d hoped; my spaghetti squash was super soggy (although based on photos, it&apos;s not always this way?) and the raved-about cauliflower was good, but not really to-die-for level like other reviewers suggested. But nonetheless, I still appreciated the creativity. 

Craving a dinner that&apos;s out of the ordinary? Looking for a veggie-packed meal? True Food Kitchen is a beautiful restaurant with spot-on service that&apos;s not to be missed."
