5,"This spot really has some of the meatiest chicken wings around town! I&apos;ve been meaning to come back to this place for my chicken wing fix and they deliver everytime. I ordered the 10 piece whole jumbo chicken wings with Sassy Seoul and Buffalo Spicy sauces on all of them. These wings are extremely big and 5 is more than enough for me! When I picked up my take out order, their service was extremely quick and I was in and out within a few minutes. Definitely check this place out!"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
4,"They currently do not have dine-in but do have takeaway and/or delivery.  I ordered The Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp with Buffalo Sauce: Mild with fries (not pictured) and a Coke.  I also ordered O-Rings that comes with Ranch dressing.  I also asked for another sauce which if I heard correctly is called the Allison sauce but I think is actually the Seoul Sassy (my bad! lol).  I waited about 10 minutes for my food and then walked for about 15-20 minutes to  Lincoln Park to enjoy my meal.  The onion rings are very good but remind me of any other tasty onion rings.  The fries were not to my liking however, the chicken sandwich was REALLY good! Simple but also perfect seasoning and flavors.  Love the choice of ingredients in the sandwich.  Would have only added pickles, but that is only because I LOVE pickles in my sandwiches.  The size of the burger was also larger than I expected.  I was very satisfied with value for money.  
My only negative comment was that the sauces were not so great but I guess they are not a necessary part of the meal.  

I would love to go back one day and enjoy my meal fresh at the restaurant.  I&apos;ve also been told that they have many other delicious items on their menu.  Highly recommended."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
5,"The chicken from here is as good as advertised! I&apos;ve had both their wings and boneless tenders and loved both. Most recently I got the boneless tenders with Buffalo sauce and loved the spice of the sauce with generous amounts all over the chicken. I also love their fries, they are perfectly cooked and seasoned well."
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,"My husband LOVED his friend chicken from Crisp (I&apos;m submitting this on his behalf). He got a split order with Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ and enjoyed them both so much, but said he ever so slightly preferred the Crisp BBQ. I convinced him to order some onion rings for me (a girl&apos;s gotta eat!) and they were soooo crunchy and flavorful and perfect. We will definitely order from Crisp again!"
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
5,"A friend of mine told me about this place, we came all the way from Westchester and can I tell you it was sooo worth it? The wings are so big &amp; churchy &amp; TASTY! My husband is very picky and we didn&apos;t know what to order, we were pretty indecisive and they were REALLY BUSY!  We DIDN&apos;T want to be that customer, but the young lady at the front end named Ashley took her time to walk us through the menu, gave us her recommendations, she was very patient, hilarious &amp; such a helpful doll! Over all the food was amazing the drive was worth it and the customer service was even better!! MUST TRY Soul sassy and crisp bbq 5 piece wings and the steak bowl AMAZING!!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,This place has some amazing chicken wings!!  I recommend getting half and half so you can try both flavors. Must try in Chicagoland.
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,This food the wings were huge asf lol. I really enjoyed it. The sauces were great on the chicken. The rice was good too
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
