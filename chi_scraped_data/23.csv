5,"My friends and I had gone to Three Dots and a Dash a few months ago, as part of her birthday celebration. We had a reservation and was seated inside, near the tiki bar counter. 

I LOVED the decor inside. The ambiance it gave off was so festive and warm. It didn&apos;t feel like a cold October night in the Midwest for our time there. I noticed that the bar was adhering to the 50% capacity and also had installed plexi glass dividers between the booths.

The menu was all online so you can access it with your phone. We had ordered one round of the famous shots and two rounds of the various mixed drinks they had. The drinks were so so delicious and I couldn&apos;t stop drinking my drinks. We had ordered a few different ones and didn&apos;t find one we disliked. Very reasonable price (around $15) for the amount of liquid/alcohol in each drink.

The staff was also very friendly and attentive, stopping by our booth every so often to make sure we were doing okay. Overall, I really enjoyed this bar and would definitely come back if I had the chance."
5,"Hands down, this is the the BEST bar in Chicago and definitely one of my most favorite places there. My husband found the place here on Yelp and we were very intrigued to check it out during our trip after seeing photos of those mouthwatering appetizers and cocktails. And OMG, this place just blew me away! Starting from the friendliest staff on the front desk (they have all the Covid rules in place), the sweetest servers, amazing atmosphere and interior, food - everything was perfect! They make absolutely the best cocktails I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. 

Can&apos;t wait to visit them again next time I&apos;m in Chicago!"
5,"My experience from start to finish was wonderful and amazing. And for starter I should tell you  that don&apos;t forget to make reservation cuz the tables fill quit fast. This place was operating before this pandemic situation and it was great as well then and even during these weird times this place was absolutely amazing. The drinks are delicious and the servers are doing a great job making sure everyone is safe and taken care of. I totally felt safe and comfortable there. For what I experienced back then everything was amazingly amazing from food to how they presents it, ambiance and fresh air. 
I totally recommend it. you won&apos;t regret just a try."
4,"(pre covid visit) I love the tiki theme!!!! It&apos;s so cute and the drinks are delicious!!! But it&apos;s so crazy crowded and the drinks extremely weak. I had 5 drinks and remained sober which was kind of a bummer...

1 star taken off for expensive &amp; weak-ass drinks."
4,"Come here for a great night out! This tiki bar is bumpin&apos;. It&apos;s a bit hard to find. Don&apos;t follow Google maps as it takes you to the front street outside what appears to be a restaurant. Go to the back alley a street behind and you will see blue torches outside the bar entry. 

Once you&apos;re in, you&apos;re transported to a tropical getaway. The music is loud, dark ambiance with bright colorful lights, and tropical decor everywhere - its so fun! Drinks are a bit on the pricier end but well worth. All the cocktails come in cute tiki cups and are delicious and strong!! You can actually taste the alcohol in some. 

Our group loved this place &amp; would definitely come back next time we&apos;re in town!"
4,"It&apos;s a little bit of Hawaii in the mid-west. More on the touristy side, but the drinks are what I&apos;m here for, and not for the art, the tiki torches and decor, or the flowers in the drinks...but the drinks themselves.

Average drink is about $15, and that&apos;s the pretty much the same in Hawaii too. 

They are known for their specialty drinks such as Mai Tai 2.0, 3 Dots or the Saturn and Negroni. All have their own special characteristics and worth the try.

But they also have Kona Brewing beers too in bottles which makes it that much closer to going to Hawaii without stepping in an airplane.

Free Wi-Fi too."
4,"YUMMM! I dont know why it took me so long to leave my review, but here we go! The ambiance 9/10 - its very dark and lowkey, which adds to the fun of the experience. However a few drinks in, I was pretty sleepy LOL. The drinks were 100/10! I was obsessed with the painkiller, I forgot what it taste like but I ordered a few and felt great! Def recommend the painkiller lol. Our server was kinda rude, but whatevs. Covid and being a server prob sucks so I forgave her poor attitude. All in all, this place is a must to visit in Chicago! If youre into tiki bars and good drinks, this place is for you!"
4,"Really cool place with a wild menu and neat vibe. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s still running during the pandemic but if you plan a trip at any point - regardless of the night of the week - call ahead for a reservation if you can. We needed them even for a mid week night in the middle of winter before all of this started.

The menu is crazy with lots of neat cocktails to try. The apps, while mainly deep fried - which I wasn&apos;t expecting for a place like this, were pretty good if not a little greasy.

If this place is one of multiple stops then definitely pace yourself. The drinks can get strong and even if they&apos;re not the prices are up there so the total cost can skyrocket without realizing it."
4,"I had this place bookmarked for what seems like an eternity... so when my fiancee and I visited Chicago recently, it was a no-brainer that we would stop into this super cool bar for drinks!

The Mai Tais are strong and not overly sweet (which is a terrific thing)!  They were out of brisket (thus, the 4 stars instead of 5), so we opted for a couple of appetizers which were pretty good.

I will be sure to stop in again next time I&apos;m in town... and maybe a bit earlier in the day so I can grab some brisket next time!

****FOUR STARS****"
5,"I can&apos;t believe haven&apos;t reviewed this place yet. I still remember the first time I heard about this place. A hidden entrance? Tiki-themed drinks? I was dying to check this place out. I had such a great time the first time I went and since then brought friends visiting from out of town and they all love it as well. This place may be pricey but all the decor, drinks, and ambiance are worth it. FYI- the drinks are strong so you&apos;re getting what you pay for!"
4,"Three dots and a dash is always a crowd favorite! Pre-COVID, whenever a friend was visiting Chicago, I always made an effort to try to get a reservation late night to experience the tropical getaway paradise that is three dots. Located down an alley off Hubbard, the &quot;secret&quot; entrance makes the experience all the more interesting. Addored with tiki lights outside to guide you to the door (and bouncer) that leads you underground. Don&apos;t come without a reservation though because this place fills up fast. They serve small bites, but the drinks are what you come for. 

They&apos;ve got an extensive menu of all sorts of tiki/tropical-inspired drinks. My favor is the mezcal based one, sweet and smokey. They also have a lot of shared beverages, like a giant treasure chest for the whole table to enjoy. During COVID times, Three Dots has set up a nice outdoor patio with picnic tables so people can still enjoy their delicious cocktails and tasty bites in a safe environment. I&apos;m very much looking forward to the days when we can safely return to their tiki-speakeasy, and feel as though you&apos;ve been transported to the islands."
1,"First, I have to begin by saying that this is one of my most unique Yelp reviews based on the situation presented. I heard about Three Dots and a Dash recently and was so excited to check out this amazing little tiki bar in the heart of downtown. I understand there are now various limitations in place with Covid in terms of capacity. I called Three Dots and a Dash yesterday prior to leaving home to ask if they were currently still operating for business. The employee said &quot;Yes, we are open.&quot; I then asked if reservations were needed for seating and he replied, &quot;No, you are welcome to walk in.&quot; So as we arrived, I was told the entrance way is in the back alley. There was not a soul out there and the doors were locked. I call again, to confirm that they are indeed still open for business. Again, reassured yes we are open and to come to the front of the building. We proceed to go to the front and there is absolutely no signage for Three Dots and a Dash. The door person at Bub City asks if we were there for Three Dots and a Dash and we said yes. He assures us we were at the right place. After taking our temperatures, he lets us in and we are seated at a table inside Bub City, which is basically a country music bar. Now I&apos;m extremely confused. The waitress tells us the Three Dots and a Dash menu can be found when we scan the code at our table. So I am now brought to a menu that is mainly Bub City items with a small 5 drink menu for Three Dots and a Dash. I had to ask the waitress the current setup between the two restaurants as it was just a very bizarre situation to expect that I am coming to a tiki bar but now sitting in a country western bar. She explained that Three Dots and a Dash is located in the lower level of Bub City and cannot be open currently due to Covid limitations. So now Bub City is offering a few drinks from the Three Dots menu. No problem, and I completely understand that due to safety issues. But why was I not told this when I called to ask if Three Dots was open for business. I felt very deceived and was given the impression that the employees tell people they are open just to get the business. Upon arrival patrons are lead to Bub City which is not the experience I was hoping for considering my husband and I both are not fans of country music. I still ordered drinks from the Three Dots menu which was extremely limited. I tried the Mai Tai and Tale of the High Seas drinks. Both drinks were very good and our service at Bub City was good, but it left a bad taste in my mouth about the business because they were not completely honest in telling me Three Dots was closed. We were lead to believe they were open after calling from home and even up until we were let in the building. I will update my review of Three Dots when I can return and have the full experience of the tiki bar atmosphere and a full menu. For now, I can only offer one star. I left feeling disappointed and deceived. I will also be leaving a review for Bub City based on this experience."
4,"Look for the tiki torches in the alleyway and you&apos;ll know you&apos;re in the right place. If you&apos;re using a GPS, it&apos;ll probably take you to the main road, but just know that the entrance is in the alleyway behind that road. Once you&apos;re there, the bouncer checks IDs, you walk down the stairs, and boom: tropical paradise. 

 The atmosphere was fun and festive, and the cocktail menu had several cocktails, beers, wines and snacks. Most of the cocktails sounded like they were on the sweet side (it is a tiki bar after all!), but I did just read that they make their cold pressed juices daily with fresh fruits, which is awesome. 

We visited on a weeknight, which seems to be the wise decision as it sounds like this place gets busy and is super popular! Our server was fine, but didn&apos;t ever stay at our table for long. This is a great spot to bring visitors for a fun experience!"
5,"So finally I had the chance to visit here, and believe me I&apos;ve been looking for the words to describe how great this place was and how much it was beyond our expectation.

Everything on the menu was looking to be so nice and delicious and we had no idea what to choose. 
The food was really nice and fresh, the ambiance was great as I can&apos;t describe how much.

This place is a real experience, it really worth visiting once, and its also good for some celebration in case your looking for someplace to celebrate some occasions then look no more its right here or if you don&apos;t have any celebrations then you should visit here in group cuz it will be way more fun with a group than going in alone."
5,"The bar has vibes of tropical jungles! If you are keen in discovering nice drinks places , then this place is a must to visit! Drinks are a bit more expensive than in some other random bars"
2,"I read on so many articles that this was a must visit bar while in Chicago so we made sure to make some time for it.

The entrance is through an alleyway which was pretty cool, I cannot remember the name the drink I ordered but it was like a liquid piña colada, definitely wasn&apos;t anything I would order again and seemed a little overhyped."
4,"Was recommended this place and had to try it out! 
Awesome decor and great drinks! The presentation of the drinks was awesome and entertaining! Our server was friendly and great. We didn&apos;t get any bad vibes from this place. Everyone was spread out, it wasn&apos;t crowded. The food wasn&apos;t anything outstanding but was still tasty. Bathrooms were clean and easily accessible and close by. This is a great first date place! We would come back here again!"
4,My classmates and I came here on a whim. It&apos;s in a somewhat creepy alley (depending on what time you arrive). There&apos;s someone at the door that will ask to see your ID. Then you walk down the stairs where all the skulls are. Our waitress was nice. It&apos;s a bit dark in here. I ordered the Hawaiian sliders. They were tasty. I also ordered the vicious virgin. I think that&apos;s what it was called. They make stiff drinks which is nice.
5,"This bar was so so experimental! I love the tiki theme &amp; even the workers are part of the theme. Due to COVID, they had specific regulations and hand sanitizers on the walls. I really loved my drinks. If you want something sweet and sour with little alcohol taste get the take off the high sea. If you want something stronger yet sweet get the tropical itch! I would go here again 10:10."
3,"Cute concept, great area, sub-par drinks, very fancy drink cups.

Once you realize what kind of place Three Dots and a Dash is, you either really love it or you find yourself saying &quot;meh&quot;.

I enjoy the secret location. I mean its so secret, the security standing outside take their jobs very seriously.You show them your ID in front of the not so secret huge &quot;Three Dots and a Dash&quot; sign and then you walk inside. There&apos;s a dimly lit staircase that transports you downstairs to a dark and tiki themed bar area. Here you&apos;ll find a menu with light bites including pupu platters and ah, yes of course, the drinks.

Here&apos;s the thing about Three Dots and a Dash that makes me say &quot;meh&quot;: the drinks have attractive presentations in their super fancy cups and the descriptions on the menu have the potential of drawing you in, but once you take a sip you feel like you&apos;ve been slighted. Its not that the drinks are bad, in my opinion they are simply &quot;nothing to write home about&quot;. On top of that, they are ridiculously high priced. An $18 old fashioned and $15 mai tai seem like highway robbery. 

I did grab a Big Bamboo, which was OK but made me realize I wasn&apos;t interested in trying any of their other drinks.

The tiki decor and cool cups may be enough to tickle your fancy paired with the dark area and secret location feel, but if anything, this spot is a tourist destination. (That&apos;s a nice way of me saying tourist trap) I would recommend going if this happens to be your first time traveling to Chicago though!"
