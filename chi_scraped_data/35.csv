5,"Amazing! Should I add something more? Now I&apos;m like a screaming girl who begs you to come here, try the food and finally join my propagandist clan which attracts new foodies (no, I don&apos;t work for Longman XD). 

Precaution: you might like to dilute the review with a drop of criticism, but not this time - everything is fine, including sanitizers, decent staff etc. etc. 

Food: the best of the best! I&apos;ve tried duck leg confit with maple braised white beans, charred orange, bacon fat breadcrumbs and thyme. The dish reminds me of the French cooking style. This is really good cold weather food!"
5,Great cocktails. Love the pretzels and beer cheese. Great burger. I think at the point they need to start fighting to end the lockdowns don&apos;t want them and other restaurants to go out of business.
5,"I&apos;ve been loving Longman and Eagle for a long time, but have to pop in and say we had the best takeout we&apos;ve had all pandemic this Friday and we have had A LOT. 

We ordered:
- roasted half chicken
- duck fat fries
- heirloom tomatoes
- simple greens salad
- cookies 

Everything was AWESOME and food was done quickly. Roasted half chicken and heirloom tomatoes were so so so delish. Couldn&apos;t recommend more.

I&apos;m pregnant so we aren&apos;t doing any dine in, but can&apos;t wait to be back soon and will keep ordering weekly takeout in the meantime!"
4,"I came to Longman &amp; Eagle over the summer when we could sit outside in the warm weather.  They have a really cool patio/semi-outdoor area that I recommend checking out.

As for the food, I had heard they were known for their burger, so.I had to try it.  It was terrific.  Not the best burger I&apos;ve had in the city (Au Cheval), but it&apos;s a really good burger.  We also got a foie gras appetizer that I highly recommend if it&apos;s on the menu."
1,"So this review is ONLY for the Sausage Shop. After reading an article online, we thought the idea was cool and trekked from S. Loop to grab a bite. We ordered two chili cheese sausages with bacon and fries/aioli.

The sausages were literally INEDIBLE. I genuinely think someone messed up and spilled an entire container of salt in the meat filling. It was above and beyond what I would call salty. By a mile. Great idea, but extremely poor execution. For what it&apos;s worth, the fries/aioli were decent."
4,"I&apos;ve been wanting to come here for a very long time. Finally made it for dinner and was surprised to see a rather full restaurant still. Definitely a hipster-esque type joint. Service was also great, very attentive and full of smiles. They have to dining areas. At the entrance, next to the bar, you have their main dark dining area, and towards the rear, they have a little more lit spacious dining area. 

We ordered a pretzel to start us off. The pretzel was warm, soft and served with a side of their Wisconsin style beer cheese. The cheese was phenomenal, just wish they would give you more of it, with that big pretzel. I also ordered a Unibroue Blanche de Chambly, a Canadian Belgian style witbier. A little something to sip on with my dinner. 

My wife ordered their Wild Boar Sloppy Joe. It came with crispy onions, jalapeños and sage. I took a bite, but didn&apos;t really care for it. Both dishes were served with fries. The fries were perfectly fried and somewhat salty, yet still tasty. 

I ordered their cheeseburger. It came with just cheese and duck skin mayo. I also ordered it medium rare, but definitely received it rare. Nonetheless, it was still one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve had tried in a long time and wouldn&apos;t hesitate to order it again. The burger tasted fresh, and the duck skin mayo complimentary this burger so perfectly. 

I&apos;ll definitely be returning, but I&apos;ll be checking out their brunch before I return for dinner."
5,"Longman &amp; Eagle cannot be beat. It&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve been, but it&apos;s been a staple for Christmastime in the past - it&apos;s so cozy and reminds me of an English tavern. Cocktails are imaginative yet classic - always strong and delicious, especially for a bourbon lover. Better known for meat dishes, the vegetarian options are also outstanding."
5,"The food is incredible. The wild boar sloppy joe is delicious. The French fries that were served were delicious as well, the coarse salt was a great touch. The menu is actually broken down from the top in smaller portions to the bottom the biggest. Definitely would recommend for anyone to try it out if you&apos;re looking for a great place with a great meal."
5,"Even though it was my first time trying this spectacular place I can&apos;t say enough good things about this place.  From the Bourbon selection and prices to the food and the staff this is one of my all time favorite places. Not sure about my server&apos;s name, she didn&apos;t give it and I didn&apos;t ask, but we had such a great service by her, and I really appreciate that."
4,"Chose this place for our last night in Chicago! I got the Le Garçon Vert cocktail and it did NOT disappoint. Was refreshing and a little spicy. Please try if you come here!

My husband and I shared the most amazing truffle mushrooms (that come with peas and goat cheese and I love goat cheese). He got the chicken sandwich which was spicy and crunchy, yum! I got the whitefish sandwich which tasted like a Big Mac with its sauce, while I didn&apos;t LOVE it, I dug it.

The vibe of this place is extremely cute and laid back, servers were great. Covid precautions were followed 200% and you had to download an app to pay the tab.

*would not get the dessert, we had an ice cream bar and a heated chocolate cookie that tasted like the oven/microwave that it came from"
4,"Come here for the amazing whiskey selection (think awesome range of typical and rare whiskey bottles) and the tasty food but be prepared for a wait during busy hours! The whiskey menu was massive with a ton of choices from whiskey cocktails to whiskey on the rocks or neat. This is the place to bring whiskey lovers! I tried the Old Fashion and it was delicious but strong. They really don&apos;t skimp on the whiskey here. They also have whiskey flights for those who want to explore. 

The food menu is concise but amazing. I came during brunch and tried the cheeseburger and the Sloppy Joe, both of which came with fresh French fries (you can taste the difference). The cheeseburger was juicy and satisfying. The boar Sloppy Joe was great in that it wasn&apos;t too heavy but had a nice texture to it helped by the small and crispy onion rings. I am usually not a huge fan of Sloppy Joe but I really liked this version. The fries were flavored well, crunchy on the outside and soft inside. I haven&apos;t had such great fries in a while. I cannot wait to come back and try other items. Everything looked delicious and prepared very well."
5,"Their variety and pricing on whisky are legit. Ordered the beet salad, beef fat fries, truffle ravioli, and butternut squash dish. Each dish was unique, full of amazing flavors, and perfectly portioned and served. Great value for the quality of the food and experience. Great atmosphere and friendly staff."
4,"I ordered pick up at longman and eagle and everything went smoothly. 

This is one of my favorite spots in the city! And I love it every time. 

I don&apos;t know if I wasn&apos;t as impressed with it this time around because we weren&apos;t dining in and couldn&apos;t get the full experience -- or if their menu wasn&apos;t as compelling this time around. Or maybe we ordered too many veggies when they do heavy meats the best

I really really enjoyed the lamb dish. Everything else was decent but not jaw dropping"
5,"Long time patron. First time reviewer. If you don&apos;t know the history of this place I recommend you do so before bringing guests. Just first class all the way. 

As a bourbon connoisseur this place is almost a religious experience. My guest had a cocktail while I had one of their amazing picks of bourbon. The best thing is if you like the pick... you can now buy the bottle. 

My wife loves the bone marrow. Their brunch is criminally under rated. 

If your here in late 19 they still have an amazing Blantons pick. It&apos;s honey forward and incredible."
4,"Probably closer to 3.5 stars.

Longman &amp; Eagle has a casual/low-key atmosphere that belies its former Michelin star status but was perfect for me looking for a place to eat by myself after getting into O&apos;Hare early in the morning (I was able to just stroll in and grab a seat at the bar). 

I ended up getting the wild boar sloppy joe since I couldn&apos;t decide between the breakfast items, and I knew the wild boar sloppy joe was popular (thanks Yelp). 

The wild boar sloppy joe was good. The ground meat had a game-y taste as expected and the mushiness of the meat was complemented well with the crispness of the fried onions and sage (which I wasn&apos;t expecting to be fried; it was kinda nice chewing on these like fries haha). 
The fries were nicely fried (it&apos;s great when they&apos;re well-done), but I didn&apos;t really taste the jalapeño flavor they were supposed to have. The presentation of the dish (as you can see in my picture) was top notch. The other big plus was that the price was quite reasonable ($16 before tax/tip). 

So why the low-ish score? While the wild boar sloppy joe was something new and fairly delicious, I don&apos;t know if I would pick it over these basic ass cheeseburgers with an over easy egg added that I used to eat in college. Maybe I&apos;m just basic haha. 

I&apos;m sure my opinion of Longman &amp; Eagle would improve on a second visit. Based on the conversations the bartender was having with other people at the bar, I can tell that this gastropub is one of those places you treasure as a local. Maybe I&apos;ll ninja edit this review after the next time I come :)"
4,"My friends and I came here on a Saturday around lunch time. We only had to wait about 5-10 minutes before we were seated.  It&apos;s a small area so I can imagine long waits during the peak times.  

I ordered the chicken and waffles which came with potatoes with bits of pork belly. It was very delicious but too expensive for the portion. 

My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito but it was definitely not filling so of course he stole some of my chicken and waffles!

Regardless, I loved the rustic ambiance and would like to try the rest of the menu (ideally without breaking the bank! )"
4,"Came here for a brunch with a friend just a few days before leaving Chicago. He&apos;s quite the foodie so he suggested this place. 

Parking -- came here on a Sunday and so parking was free, plenty of space on the street. 

The order:
- Shakshuka: this has baked eggs, spiced tomato, roasted olives, feta with toast. This was my first time trying Shakshuka and i was excited! It lived up to the hype! I loved it, even though the tomato sauce gave me acid reflux later on. Worth it. That&apos;s how good it is. 
- French omelette -- this came with roasted mushrooms, herbed goat cheese and house potatoes. I love potatoes and these were yummy. It wasn&apos;t anything crazy, pretty standard omelette but it was good. 

Not too expensive, i find this spot for brunch to be more &quot;manly&quot;, it has a rustic feel with all the wood and nice bar. It isn&apos;t as girly as most brunch places, I recommend it!"
4,"It was an incredibly long day for me before I ended up here.  I had this spot chosen long before my re-visit back to Chicago because I love me some good whiskey.  I&apos;ll be honest, when I came in I was expecting a brightly lit sophisticated looking room that would resemble some lucky guy&apos;s cigar and bar room.  But we came in to a dark, dingy bar with no lights on.  Then the first thing we wanted to try, Pappy&apos;s 23 year (again, I studied the menu before I came) they were out of.  
But then slowly the clouds started to part ways and we ordered a little bit of everything.  From more pricier flights to their $3 shots and cocktails, life was getting better.  I also want to add that their Old Fashions were so well-balanced and probably one of the better ones I&apos;ve ever had.  Yeah, I would come back for sure."
3,"We came back bc of our wonderful experience last time with an out of town guest. This time their menu was meh.... sloppy joe...amish chicken...grilled salmon ...and $15 for tomato salad with essence of tuna flavor? All tried and ho hum. Boring!

The food was good.
The waitress was ok...kinda short in response. She didnt seem interested at all...or even faked it.
The drinks were okay too.
Honest, it was a bit of a let down bc the food was just ordinary this time with no bone marrow or anything special. For the price I&apos;d expect something unique. Maybe all of these hipster places are played out for us residents.

We may give it another try but doubt it."
4,"We visited Longman &amp; Eagle on a Monday night and hardly had to wait. It is a small place with a great atmosphere and my party of 4 didn&apos;t mind the wait for our table since we were enjoying the drinks at the bar so much. 

Once we were seated, we couldn&apos;t wait to order. Their menu changes frequently (how fun is that?!) so it was fun to see some of the menu options. I admit that I went pretty safe and got their cheeseburger and fries. My burger was anything but basic though, it was cooked to perfection and looked &apos;basic&apos; until I tasted it. The flavor was out of this world! The spiced mayo sauce and cool favored cheese they adorned the burger with made the difference between your basic cheeseburger and a Longman &amp; Eagle cheeseburger and I didn&apos;t even bother spoiling my fries with ketchup since they were so good just on their own. 

Not super hungry for a meal? If you&apos;re looking for a great spot to just grab drinks and an appetizer then the outdoor patio bar would be the perfect spot for you! Either way, eating a full meal or just grabbing drinks, this spot is great!"
