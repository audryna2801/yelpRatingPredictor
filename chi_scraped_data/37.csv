5,"Why am I just now finding this place? A huge variety of pressed sandwiches, platters, salads, desserts and drinks. I had to start with the tender con leche cookie (melt in your mouth amazing)! 

I got two sandwiches to share and the jarmon definitely beat out the cubano. The cubano was too dry for my liking but still tasty. The jarmon with the red peppers is a delicious combo. 

This place is clean, everyone is wearing masks and the service is quick. Go here for a delicious lunch and don&apos;t forget that cookie!"
5,"Customer service: 5/5 Sweetest lady working in the front. She apologized for not having churros and let me pick whatever dessert I wanted as a replacement.

Pandemic precautions: Online ordering is available and very easy to do. Order was ready by the time it said it would be.

Pollo chimichurri platillo: 5/5 Very good, full of chicken, and good amount of food. Would appreciate maybe more rice to go with it.

Ropa viejo platillo: 4/5 Very flavorful, but pollo chimichurri was more up my alley.

Cubano sandwich: 3/5 A little dry. For the price, I&apos;ve had better.

Guava cheesecake: 3/5 Flavors were decent, though I would prefer more of a crust with a crunch than a cake-based crust."
5,"TL;DR
What to order:
* cafe con leche ($2.79/$3.29)
* cubano ($7.49)
* probably anything, really

What to watch out for:
* this location is very small (might not matter much for the time being since no dining in is allowed anyway, heh)
* cafe con leche comes pre-sweetened

========

I&apos;ve gone to the south loop Ida B Wells location a couple times pre-COVID and really enjoyed the cubano ($7.49) and one of the breakfast sandwiches with steak in it. I&apos;ve also sampled the Ropa Vieja ($8.29) and Guava-Q ($7.99) and everything I&apos;ve tried has been really good. 

As mentioned above, I really like the cafe con leche and it&apos;s one of the tastiest coffees I&apos;ve ever had, but it does come quite sweet. Next time if I have some self-control I&apos;ll ask for it to be less sweet. I&apos;ve also tried the guava cheesecake ($3-4?), which was interesting and not bad, though I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the sponge cake bottom crust and it was on the sweeter side. There was also a really great flan dessert I tried before, but I didn&apos;t see it at this location when I went recently. 

I really love Cafecito and have never had a bad experience the handful of times that I&apos;ve been at either this one or the south loop location! Will definitely be back to try more of the menu."
3,"So... this place came highly recommended but I just wasn&apos;t impressed. The sandwiches were messy and basically just grilled chicken in bread with bbq sauce.

The pastry was good but hardly any filling. 

Don&apos;t have much to say other than there are better sandwich options in Chicago."
4,"I had the cubano sandwich and the cafe con leche.  The cubano sandwich is a bit on the smaller side, but it is tasty.  I would order a side with it, if I was super hungry.  The cafe con leche is devine. I wish I could drink this everyday.

Order online and pick up is easy and quick!  The staff here is nice.  I can&apos;t wait to try other things from this place."
3,"I am off the mark on this one.  The vast majority of reviewers are awarding Cafecito 4 and 5 stars.  But I&apos;m entitled to my opinion and there&apos;s an explanation to it, not to mention that there could be strong, midline, or weak 3 star locales.  Cafecito would be a strong 3 stars.

I was in Chicago&apos;s Loop and had a feeling I could easily find Cuban food.  There were some stand-alones and I also saw a few Cafecito locations.  I didn&apos;t want to expend much effort chasing down Cuban food and this location is right at the base of the stairs and the elevator from the Loop&apos;s CTA Washington-Wells station, and in a nice area.

In this regard, I even bore myself:  I ordered a ropa vieja platter, like I always do.  It came with black beans, rice, and plantains.  I also ordered a soft drink.  I liked that they use those socially responsible sloped top plastic drink cups that don&apos;t require a straw.  Why didn&apos;t someone come up with that design a long time ago?  With regard to the ropa vieja, it was stellar.  It was among the best I&apos;ve ever tasted.  So, then, what was the issue?  There wasn&apos;t very much of it ... and staples like rice, beans, and few plantains don&apos;t cost much to put together, yet there was a noticeable price gap between their sandwiches (~$8), of which there is also a ropa vieja sandwich, and the platter(s) (~$13).  I still went for it because I hadn&apos;t eaten that morning and wanted a platter instead of a sandwich.  

The service at Cafecito was good, the store was fine, with most people picking up food, and the location is very convenient.  They&apos;ve got it dialed in this regard - with another one near the main library and another one in River North, which I guess people call Streeterville, which then leads me to wonder if the platters are priced for the Loop and the CBD.  

Again, Cafecito is a strong 3 star kind of place.  I went back the next day and got a conventionally priced pastelito de guayaba y queso to take with me and snack on."
5,"So apparently everything here is amazing! I had the Guava-q pork Pressed Sandwich, the guava bbq sauce was everything and more, the right amount sweetness and seasoned to perfection and the caramelized onions were a great addition to it. I chose pork but you can get it as a chicken sandwich. The Cuban Sandwich is crowd favorite and staple of the restaurant with roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. The prices are super reasonable too. I enjoyed the shrimp ceviche salad too, although I have had better. The tortilla chips that came with it were super fresh and tasty and seemed to be made in house. The caf√© con leche is another favorite and staple. Great coffee and great food (sandwiches and plates) is a rare find. The sandwiches are unique and all super flavorful. I&apos;m super excited to try the Jerk Chicken Sandwich next! There is a wide variety of breakfast sandwiches, salads, lunch sandwiches and caffeine fixes. Overall an amazing gem! Great place for lunch or breakfast! A must try!"
5,"Since it was dreary out today, was craving something warm and decided to order ahead for a cubano and churro. They had covid guidelines in place - masks, signs for only 4 customers in the space at a time - and pickup was a breeze. 

The cubano was nice, toasty and a good size.  I was debating between this and the chimichurri steak but glad I went the OG route.  The churro was nice and flaky (wish they had creme filled ones though!). The meal definitely hit the spot. If you&apos;re in the area, definitely come support this local business!"
4,"I got the ropa vejes. Really really great. It is the skirt steak sandwich with the plantains. Really unique and really good. 
When I went there wasn&apos;t a line and only had to wait about five minutes for my food. It&apos;s in a really dingy part of town and Street and that was the only downside was it just felt like a really dirty area."
4,I&apos;ve tried the other sandwiches but my go-to here is the tuna. I find the other sandwiches can be hit or miss. Sometimes the meat on the Cubano doesn&apos;t knock my socks off.
5,"Good sandwiches at cheap prices! I recommend the cubano. The sandwiches feel homemade, deep flavors and comfy feels.

I especially liked the roast pork in my cubano. It was fatty and fresh, hard to find in processed or chain restraunts. Service was super quick, and menu has nice variety. My coworkers all enjoyed their food as well, they did say the jerk chicken was hotter than expected. Sandwiches came out quickly and service was nice.

The sandwiches are a bit small, so you may want a side as well, and seating is limited. They are usually pretty busy as well but the wait isn&apos;t long.

Definitely try this place out if you&apos;re in the Loop!"
5,"i got their steak chimichurri plate and their hot chocolate for lunch, and man, the food &amp; THE HOT CHOCOLATE were good &amp; warmed me up in this cold Chicago weather!  I particularly enjoyed my steak chimichurri plate. the rice and beans were SO flavorful, and the chimichurri sauce and steak chunks were a delight. the portion was a good size for me  - not too little and not too much.

if my friend had not recommended our group this place when we visited Chicago yesterday, I would have totally passed by it! I&apos;m glad I tried it out!"
4,Love the sandwiches here.  I got the Chivito which is essentially breakfast lunch and dinner in a Cuban sandwich.  For the money it&apos;s one of the best sandwiches in Chicago.  The only negative thing about my experience was the table I sat at had a bunch of crumbs on it.  I didn&apos;t care.  The sandwiches here are so on point I&apos;m willing to eat my food on top the previous patrons sandwich crumbs.  Can&apos;t wait to comeback.
5,Really Delicious ice resturant and full safety from COVID-19 With mask and other things.
5,"I have tried their location in the loop several
Times. It&apos;s always awesome food and good service. Their food is a must try."
3,"Cafecito didn&apos;t wow me, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;m the intended audience either.  When I order coffee it&apos;s more flavoring, cream, &amp; sugar.  That&apos;s just not how things are done here at Cafecito.  This is coffee for the purists - strong &amp; dark.  

With regards to the food - it&apos;s fine.  I got the Cuban &amp; it was good, just not anything special.  If you are a local this is probably a pretty cool joint, but as a visitor I wanted something more memorable or unique.  My party also had ceviche &amp; salad - no complaints.

What I will warn you is that this joint gets crazy busy around lunch time with lines out the door.  So make sure you come before or after the lunch rush.  Beyond this, I&apos;m a fan of any eatery that serves San Pellegrino Limonata.

Ps:  Some of the uploaded pictures are disingenuous, are of another location, &amp; have likely been up loaded by the owners in an attempt to make this location look more appealing.  This location is VERY SMALL."
4,"We stopped in for a little snack and really enjoyed our sandwich, it was plenty for my husband &amp; I to share for a &quot;snack&quot;.  We got the Ropa Vieja which was very flavorful and something different for us. Looking forward to going back and trying other things. 

Side note: it&apos;s not as big as some pictures indicate. I&apos;m not sure if some the picture are of a different location but it&apos;s not the small downtown location."
5,"This place is so amazing! Great service, food is delicious. I can eat here everyday of the week! I recently moved and wished they had this place here in Phoenix!"
3,"Great food, no restroom. Coffee hit the spot and I had nowhere to go. You&apos;ve been warned."
4,"Great food.  Great prices opens 7am -6p for caf√© con leche and great Sandwiches.  
Order large meal plates for dinner and pick up on the way home.  
Great hearty meals. Authentic Cuban food.

I got a palomilla sandwich but it wasn&apos;t a hole steak it seemed to be a minced bundle of steak meat in between Cuban bread. Though It was perfectly seasoned Cuban style 
I would come back"
