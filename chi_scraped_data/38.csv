5,"[Covid review]: I love Ramen Wasabi! Since Covid, they have taken measures for customer safety such as staff wearing masks, outdoor seating, and adequately spaced dining tables. The staff were friendly, quick to seat us and quick to serve us. Their ramen is reliably delicious (I always get the tonkatsu), and their soy eggs are done perfectly! Just an FYI, they do charge an extra 3% Covid surcharge but I think that&apos;s reasonable given all the changes that they have had to make."
5,"First time back out in the REAL WORLD...well sort of real world, but I must say I am trying new and novel experiences only. I have never been to Ramen Wasabi until last week when I came with my friend but found out you need reservations. They accept walk ins but they were very busy and we decided not to wait. My buddy made a reservation for the following Friday and we just finished our lunch. We both had Ramen, but the menu is also loaded with other tasty treats. When you sit at your table, you scan the menu with your smartphone camera. I ordered the &quot;classic&quot; Original Tonkotsu, and my close personal friend had the Hakata. They are both on the top of the menu and it looked like the most popular dish based on other reviews. My paintball partner said the Hakata was almost as good as the Tonkotsu."
5,"Cues music- &quot;You&apos;re simply the best, better than all the rest&quot; *Tina Turner voice

Hands down the best ramen in the city. Today, yesterday and every day. Nobody nails the broth like they do! It&apos;s creamy and rich without being too salty.  Portions are a tad smaller in comparison to Oiistar, but I&apos;m okay with that because they make up for it in flavor. Noodles are cooked perfectly al dente and the egg is marinated to perfection. 

We came here Sunday for lunch and we were the only table there. Unusual because in the past we usually expect to wait 30-60 mins for a table but I get it #covid

They have about 6-8 tables outside and heat lamps so we were comfortable in high 40 degree weather. Service is always pleasant and staff were wearing masks appropriately."
5,"I recently stopped in with my bf and he didn&apos;t have a reservation. We came in a Tuesday during lunch and were able to sit right away. My favorite dish was the pork buns and the spring rolls. The spring rolls come in this tasty sauce and the buns come 2 per order 

For ramen we had the garlic miso I believe which was the perfect level of spice. If you want it more spicy you can ask for togarashi which is a spice you can add on top. The texture of the noodles are nice and thick I&apos;m pretty sure they make their own noodles too which is awesome."
5,"The BEST genuine ramen in Chicago! Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso Ramen &amp; Original Tonkotsu are 10 out of 10. Perfect noodle, seasoning, and soup - everything is so RIGHT! (not American style ramen) It&apos;s Tokyo style ramen for sure! 

Chicken Karaage is so juicy, highly recommend!"
2,"I really appreciated that this place is located in a quiet area of WP where traffic is pretty light.  

We started off with drinks (of course) where I ordered an old fashioned and my friend ordered a glass of wine.  Edamame was served hot and tasted as expected.  I ordered the Hakata Classic which hit the spot on such a cold day.

Here is where I have issue with this place.  We were seated next to a door in which staff was constantly going in and out to serve other patrons in a tent outside.  Often, the staff wouldn&apos;t close the door behind them.  It was a huge nuisance.  I got up a couple of times to personally close the door.  When the bartender who was serving us came by to check on us, I did mention this.  Her response was that they have to go out to serve other patrons and could use no other door - which was not what I even implied or was getting at.  I did explain to her that I was simply asking that they close the door behind them given where we sat.  In response, I got &apos;Thank you for your understanding.&apos;  We could have moved but we were already done with our meal by the time she came over.  

Also, I learned from her that the old fashioned was made with Benchmark bourbon and not Maker&apos;s Mark, which is listed on the menu.  I was pretty disappointed.  She mentioned that they were using a lower shelf one since &apos;it doesn&apos;t taste different&apos;.  I was pretty ticked to hear that.  If you&apos;re gonna use a lower cost bourbon then the price should be lower and uh.. the menu should reflect the bourbon you are using!  I didn&apos;t bother commenting as I&apos;d already complained about the door.  I just wanted to leave.

Sadly, I did enjoy my meal but giving a low rating because of the service."
5,"My go-to ramen spot and bowl in Chicago: Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso. It is super flavorful with the perfect amount of spice balanced with umami. Don&apos;t let the spice scare you away, it&apos;s delicious! What&apos;s inside: egg noodles, rich pork broth, berkshire pork belly, soft boiled egg, marinated bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, sesame, scallions, garlic chips, chili threads. They usually have a wait but it is worth it."
4,"Such great ramen! On a freezing night, this is definitely what you need. My boyfriend and I split the Tonkotsu ramen and got two appetizers - the pork belly buns and Brussel sprouts. We also got a beer and a mule. This was such a fulfilling meal, I will tell you! The portions were perfect, the ramen was flavorful and hit the right spot! This is going to become one of my favorites, and I will be back. 
Our server was quite distracted, but if the food is great, I don&apos;t really care."
5,"Super popular ramen restaurant. Often very long wait times. But the taste of deliciousness is worth it!

Food:
Takoyaki - 5/5 - beautiful presentation and wonderful taste
Pork belly - 5/5 - excellent sweet and savory taste 

Original tonkotsu - 5/5 - rich savory broth. Amazingly exquisite tender pork belly slices and the slices were just right size/volume. Perfectly textured ramen noodle. A favorite!
Spicy miso garlic ramen - 5/5 - deliciousness; another slam dunk if you like spicy + miso + garlic 
Hagata Red - 5/5 - the most spicy of the ramen options here; another slam dunk for spiciness 
Tokyo classic shoyu - 5/5 - an excellent soy sauce broth alternative if you&apos;re not in the mood for the rich savory Tonkotsu

Ambience:
Beautifully designed with perfect degree of dim lighting. Outdoor seating also seasonally available 

Service:
(Pre- and post-pandemic) this place is often  packed and wait lines very common... but once you do get seating and service, they are very friendly, fast and professional"
4,"One of my favorite ramen spots. They take the time to make the broth as delicious as possible and it shows. The broth is insanely flavorful and each bowl comes with a good amount of standard ingredients without adding extras. 

The pork belly buns are out of this world. Their pork belly melts in your mouth and the bun includes some crunchy slaw on the bottom that pairs perfectly. 

Highly recommend this place!"
5,"Absolutely amazing ramen ..the broth is to die for !!! The spicy broth is not too spicy which is great. The pork belly is tender. Cute spoon to eat it with. The noodles are thick! Delicious! Would highly recommend. They also have great menu options. 

They do have indoor seating during covid (socially distanced of course).
Parking is a bit tight because of the bike lanes so park up Milwaukee a bit north and park on residential."
5,"We came here on Halloween night and due to Covid we had to sit outside but thankfully heated lamps were set up. 

For ramen, I decided to get the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso because I wanted something spicy and tasty. I asked for it to be extra spicy. This ramen was delicious and definitely a great choice for a cold night. Portions were good and food came out fairly quickly. 

Overall the food, service and ambiance were excellent. I will definitely be coming back."
5,"Ordered the spicy spring rolls as appetizers, and they had the right amount of sauce and crunch. For the main course, I ordered the spicy miso and my SO ordered the tonkotsu. Both were great! Come in if you want to have some great ramen!"
5,"Great service; Makala was sweet and efficient.  Checked on us often but not to the point of interruption.

The spicy garlic ramen was delicious. The broth was rich and flavorful yet not too salty.

Definitely one of the better bowl of Ramen in Chicago.  I would definitely come back."
5,"There&apos;s nothing like a nice bowl of ramen on a fall or winter night. This is hands down one of the best ramen spots in Chicago. We started out with the tako Yaki and it was definitely pretty to look at and the flavors and textures of the dish are so powerful and mouth watering. I got the spicy roasted garlic miso and it is to die for. The broth is so warm, savory and spicy that it warms the soul. The eggs are perfectly soft boiled. The pork belly is so tender that it pretty much melts on your tongue. Everything in the bowl blends together and it is perfection. The ambiance is so chill and so are the servers. 10/10 recommendation. The perfect date spot."
1,"Went back 6 years later. 

My original review still stands except this time the service was worse. We waited over an hour for our ramen. An hour. For ramen. I understand they&apos;re busy with take out orders (actually I don&apos;t understand cuz the food is not good) but c&apos;mon... an hour. Really? 

And they don&apos;t have parking and just no. 

Good thing I was among amazing company and we bring a good time with us or last night woulda been a waste of time and money. ‚Äç"
5,"We biked to this location from bucktown during Covid.

They had outdoor seating available and socially distanced tables. The waiters wore masks and hand sanitizer was provided.

To start off, I was VERY impressed by our service. For all you hydro homies out there- this is HH approved. They left us not one but 2 pitchers of water. Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing- just perfect!

We highly recommend the pork belly buns. They are to die for. Packed with flavor and the perfect consistency, they are delightful! Don&apos;t eat too much, because this app + the ramen alone will leave you stuffed !

We got the spicy miso garlic ramen. It was GREAT. One of my top fave ramens. The bamboo shoots were actually enjoyable, it comes with the egg, and the pork was savory. 

Overall we were VERY pleased with our experience here and would highly recommend!"
5,"This is the best Ramen spot in Chicago hands down. I&apos;ve been to all the &quot;top&quot; ramen places in Chicago and this one tops them all. My server Aggie was great! She was nice and funny. Overall, I was impressed my experience today with Ramen Wasabi."
4,"Ramen wasabi is just as good as it&apos;s sister restaurant (ramen Takeya in west loop) with more of a &quot;night life&quot; vibe. During non pandemic times, its always busy so be prepared to wait. 

We&apos;ve ordered take out from here. It&apos;s good (still better than most ramen) but unfortunately it cannot match eating in the restaurant and having everything hot and ready. We will continue to order!"
5,"Best Ramen in Chicago! We love their Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso Ramen. They also have great cocktails and sake. Best eaten on cold snowy days, felt very covid safe as well. 11/10 recommend!"
