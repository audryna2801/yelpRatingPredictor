5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"I must say, I was not expecting the burger to live up to its hype. But it was pretty damm good, It&apos;s a burger that keeps you wanting to go back for another bite. We ordered a double thinking it was a double patty but it was actually three patties. I guess the single patty is two patties. We ordered it with the bacon. Overall the burger was meaty and thickkk. Delicious. And fries were thick too. The aioli was not my fav. Alarmist was on the tab too. Best hazy in town. Super goood. 
However, we lucked out on the wait. We went during COVID times. Was told it was a 30 min wait but it turned out to be just a few. I think that definitely had an impact on our dining experience. My bf told me normally it&apos;s like a 5 hrs wait. Crazy. But the restaurant itself is so small! So that makes sense. 
Au Cheval lives up to its expectations. Would recommend."
5,"Parking can be tough (it just snowed a bunch) but well worth it. This was one of the best burgers I have ever had. The single cheeseburger is actually two patties and was plenty of food. Service was quick and they had very good COVID measures in place as well. It&apos;s not a huge menu but quality was top-notch!

I added bacon to my burger and would recommend, it&apos;s really thick! Their ranch was fantastic as well if you are needing a side for your fries."
5,"We had a wonderful dinner tonight.  Dominiqua (hope I spelled that correctly) was our server.  Friendly, attentive and helpful.  She was wonderful.  All the others who served were also helpful and friendly.  

The bartender makes a great hot toddy and brought our dessert.  He was engaging and shared his drink ideas for hot toddy recipes.  

The food was fantastic.  We had so much flavor in every bite.  Chicken as an appetizer and the flavorful burgers.  But the Milles Feuille for dessert is incredible.  

Hello e sat outside in the tent and it was warm and the service made it warmer.  Cannot wait to return."
1,"Came to Au Cheval tonight. Standard lil 2hr wait for a group of 5. This place should not be accepting reservations of groups larger than 4. They sat my group of 5 people at a 4-top booth and refused to let us pull up a chair because of covid. I get that you have restrictions. But...what kind of fools will allow people to make 5 person reservations when you can only have a 4-top. I feel misguided and disillusioned. My only ask is that you stop misrepresenting table accommodations when your wait times are so long.  

Then, the waiter told us that Lebron and 4 other Cleveland Cavs teammates squeezed into the same little booth as us. Booooooooooo! What does Lebron have to do with me. Additionally, why do I have to accept what another Black person settled for? Byeee mullet and jean jacket man."
5,"Did I wait 2 hours on a Sunday for dinner? Yes. Was it worth it? 10000% yes. Here are some hot tips.

1) come during off hours because it&apos;s first come, first serve. This means before 5:30 for dinner if you don&apos;t want to wait a while.

2) get your name on a waitlist and go grab a cocktail. Bad hunter was our go-to spot (RIP :( ) but we went to Bar Siena and it did not disappoint. Tipsy burgers are the best burgers.

3) Au Cheval has VERY reasonable alcohol prices for the area so take advantage of that if you aren&apos;t boozed up from the pregame cocktails.

4) If you eat bacon, ALWAYS worth it to get it (+egg) on your burger

Bam. There&apos;s a reason this place is worth it. A legend among legends."
4,"The menu is really good! I would give even more stars for it than we have there! If you visit our city for the first time remember to try burgers from here! It&apos;s a must!  My absolute fav is a double with bacon. Order this and then thank me) 

My score could have been the highest but we were waiting for ages for the delivery. It&apos;s a little sad and frustrating epecially when you are as hungry as a wolf! We reeally wanted to give 5 stars but unfortunately this minus made us so upset that we just couldn&apos;t turn a blind eye( 

Be ready to wait but be sure you&apos;ll enjoy the food)"
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
1,Overrated burger that you can get at Small Cheval.  No thanks.  Pass on waiting hours in line.
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
5,"How do I begin? Well, I suppose I&apos;ll start off by introducing myself and thanking you all to take the time out of your certainly very busy day to read my Yelp review. My name is Hector Barbossa. I take Yelping very seriously, as I strongly believe Yelp is a crucial and very much mutualistic medium between restaurants and potential restaurant patrons.

I apologize for getting carried away. Now back to Au Cheval. Indubitably one of, if not the best burger I have ever had. A juicy patty with sharp cheese, thick cuts of seasoned bacon, a perfectly cooked egg, all sandwiched between two fluffy buns. Makes me emotional just thinking about it.

The ambience I do have trouble enjoying. The lighting is nearly dungeon-esque. Put yourself in my shoes just for a brief moment.
*You rendezvous with an old friend of yours that you haven&apos;t seen in years. Can&apos;t wait to catch up right? Well unfortunately inside of Au Cheval it is loud and dark. Is it a deal breaker? Certainly not. The food was indeed incredible and whoever thinks that an environment is more important than the food itself is full of barnacles.

Thank you for reading my review."
