5,"I&apos;ve only been here maybe 3 times in the last couple of years, mostly because it is a little out of the way, but they never disappoint. The first time, I had ordered a few pies for Thanksgiving (pre-COVID) of course. We got a fruit pie of some sort (likely apple) and a chocolate chess pie. Both were good, but not exceptional.

The second time I came was to buy cupcakes for a coworkers birthday. I picked up a mini turtle cheesecake for myself and it was loaded with pecans, chocolate, and caramel. Great, classic combinations and the ratios were just perfect. Most recently, came to pick up 2 cupcakes for myself and the husband to celebrate an early valentine&apos;s day. With COVID, you order and pay online and stop by just for pickup. I did see that they also take walk-ins and there is a QR code you could scan for the menu. 

We got the red velvet and the chocolate peanut butter cupcakes. My favorite of the two was the red velvet - the highlight being the cream cheese frosting! It was very, very rich, almost tasting like a sweet cheesecake. The cakes itself were very moist too. I will definitely come back in the future to try more of the cupcakes/cakes!"
5,"Tip: Due to COVID restrictions, order ahead online for pickup. Efficient and staff is quick, organized.

I have had several pastries here: cookies, brownies, bars, scones and cupcakes. All fresh and delicious.  Owner is very friendly and staff is great. Cupcakes are my personal favorite. I highly recommend this place."
5,Super delicious cakes and following safe covid practices of ordering online and only letting one customer in at a time
1,"Rude to people with babies...I walked in with my 18 month old in the cold and because I hadn&apos;t online she wanted me to go outside and place an order with my baby in my arm...

Honestly so rude and not accommodating...

Never again with Mandy B&apos;s...so snobby and rude...

They may be okay in chicago but on a national level they are just okay"
5,"It is hard to find something here that isn&apos;t delicious. Sweet Mandy B&apos;s just gets dessert right! 

Some favorites are the classic sugar cookies with buttercream frosting, raspberry bars, and pies. Be patient with the parking around here--these treats are well worth it!"
5,"Yuuuuummm! These are by far the best cupcakes! They are baked to perfection and i love a buttercream frosting! Typically i don&apos;t like cake or many cupcakes because they are dry, bad frosting or just heavy. 
These cupcakes are fluffy, well balanced and you don&apos;t feel weighed down after eating two ‚Äç ie the two missing"
2,"We stopped in for dessert and were instructed that we had to place the order online due to COVID. We followed those instructions and did receive our order fairly quickly. The cupcake was tasty but did leave a slight aftertaste. I think it was from the mini peanut butter cup on top that did not taste like a Reese&apos;s. My complaint was really with the chocolate chip cookie. I guess I expected that the cookie would have been baked fresh that day, not a refrigerated cookie, especially when it is $3 a cookie. Won&apos;t go back."
3,"[COVID takeout review]

Overall: My overhyped expectations unfortunately weren&apos;t met, but I could&apos;ve just picked the wrong pie.

The good: Pickup was a breeze, even on the (likely) busiest day of the year (the day before Thanksgiving). They have two lines for online vs. phone orders, which is helpful given that there were plenty of people waiting (especially during COVID times). The staff was friendly and efficient and the packaging for the pie was perfect.

The not-so-good: The filling of the apple streusel pie was underwhelming. There was plenty of apple inside but not a lot of mixture or filling otherwise. I love apples, but if I&apos;m gonna eat a pie I want to have some sugary filling to go along with it! The apple also had an underbaked texture to it; it was still quite crisp and not the gooey texture you expect when biting into an apple pie."
5,"Yep. Still delicious and still the best red velvet cupcakes. It&apos;s been three years since my first review of this place and I still stand by it (even after trying other cupcake places in Chicago!) 

Wise words to live by: TREAT YO SELF!"
1,"Five of us stopped by Sweet Mandy B&apos;s for coffee and dessert. After making our purchase we sat down in the restaurant area and was blown away by the horrible stench. After complaining  we were told by one of the staff that they just cleaned the grease traps. Up to this point I didn&apos;t know anything about a grease trap. Evidently...cleaning a grease trap creates a disgusting and overwhelming combined scent of fecal matter, rotting food, and vomit. I don&apos;t know why anyone would think that it is a good idea to clean one during business hours. Especially when it is very cold outside and there is no cross ventilation to ease the nauseating smell. 

We purchased a molasses cookie, cupcakes, 7 layer bar, toffee pudding cake and coffee. Since we were visiting from out of town and this was our last meet up we tried to get past the smell. A short time passed and one person in the party boxed what they wanted and we tossed the rest and said our goodbyes."
5,"I fiiiiiinally went to Sweet Mandy B&apos;s. I&apos;ve had their cupcakes twice before this from friends who brought them home. 
My favorite is their cookie dough cupcake. Sweet Mandy B&apos;s is really for someone who loves frostings. 

I love that there have vegan cupcakes: chocolate and vanilla. 

It was my first time going and I didn&apos;t know what to expect. There was a line on a Saturday afternoon along the display counters. When the lady took my order, it was super face paced like I should&apos;ve already had figured out what I wanted, and pay right away. I wasn&apos;t quite ready for that, as it was my first time and I didn&apos;t know everything that was available. Due to the rush, I randomly ordered some cupcakes and called it a day. Next time I&apos;m back, I&apos;ll be more prepared. When I was paying, I was crossing another person that was already paying, but I couldn&apos;t help it because the lady gave me the payment e-device, so all I can say to him was &quot;pardon my reach&quot;. I&apos;m sure she had good intentions of trying to finish with me quick so she can get to the next one, but still,... If you were that man, &amp; you&apos;re reading this, I&apos;m sorry again!"
5,"Literally the best place in the city to get desserts from. The banana cupcakes are my favorite. I&apos;ve ordered from here for multiple events like birthdays, baby showers, and work functions and they&apos;re always a hit. I work just a few blocks away and stop in whenever I get the chance."
5,"THE BEST BAKERY IN CHICAGO. You simply cannot go wrong here. My favorites are the frosted sugar cookies (duh!), the Rice Krispies and any of the cakes. Their cinnamon buns are also unreal. Seriously, I don&apos;t know how they do it, but the treats are not too heavy and are truly some of the most delicious things you could eat."
5,I am a convert. Sweet Many B&apos;s is actually amazing and I highly recommend! It has become my go to for any festive cupcake needs.
4,"Did curbside pickup during COVID. In order to do curbside, you have to order your dessert online and it says you have to wait 20 minutes but our order was ready within 5 min. I would recommend ordering before arriving to the location anyways! Our desserts were ready very quickly and the staff was very friendly as well! We got the ranger cookie and the magic bar. Truthfully, I did think the ranger cookie was a bit hard and chewy. I was expecting a samoa like texture but it turned out to be much chewier. I wish they had either offered to warm our dessert or given us at home directions to warm our dessert. The magic bar was great and tasted quite fresh. I would like to give Sweet Mandy B&apos;s another try soon but I&apos;m not quite sure it completely lived up to the hype for me."
4,"I can see the appeal of this place. It&apos;s a cute shop that carries old fashioned desserts. My co-worker recommended this place and kept raving about the iced sugar cookies, which I got.

When I took my first bite, I felt a rush of sweetness saturate my mouth. Honestly, it was a bit much for me. I do have a sweet tooth, but man that was alot. The cookie was a bit pricy, about $3.32. But in fairness, the cookie was big and the shop is located in Lincoln Park. 

*I did notice prices aren&apos;t listed on the desserts.

EDIT: I went back today and got the Pumpkin cream cheese cupcake. It tasted way better! It wasn&apos;t overly sweet like the iced sugar cookie and the cupcake itself was super moist! The cream cheese wasn&apos;t overpowering, which I liked. It was a nice balance. I think the cupcake was the redeeming factor. I will definitely come back for the cupcakes and maybe the rainbow sprinkles cookie. :3"
4,"Ok, Sweet Mandy B&apos;s. I was secretly hoping that I won&apos;t like you. Just can&apos;t handle another bakery during this time of inactivity. But my husband wanted some sweets for his birthday so I had to try it out. Man, did they deliver! Yum! I&apos;m super picky but everything was so good! I got the carrot cupcake, snickerdoodle cookie and double doozie cookie. Everything was delicious! I will definitely be back, probably this weekend!"
5,The best cupcakes for Valentine&apos;s Day!! I live in the neighborhood and the staff is very friendly one bite of the chocolate cupcake and you are in heaven just amazing!!
4,"Could not leave Chicago with out trying some sweets. Sweet Mandy B&apos;s was one of my top spots to have to try.

Street parking, we just idled and I ran in to grabbed stuff to go.

Very cute set up. Large bakery, tons of different options. 

Chocolate Chip Cookie - $2.75
Oatmeal Raisin Cookie - $2.75

Was not in the mood for cake, so I went with cookies. They were soft and fresh. Good chew and not to overly sweet."
4,"I was at a friends house and she gave me a taste of the oreo brownie from Sweet Mandy B&apos;s. I tried everything not to eat the whole brownie before she could even have a bite.  I literally left her house and went straight to the bakery.  I tried out the peanut butter cupcake and sugar cookie which were good but nothing super special. They were out of oreo brownies when I arrived at the bakery near their closing, but I did manage to snag one of their regular frosted brownies. OMG, even that was amazing, it&apos;s like eating fudge. If you are a chocolate person the brownie&apos;s are a must try."
