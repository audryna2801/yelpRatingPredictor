5,"Where should I start?  This was five stars all around.
The ambiance was great!  
The crusty bread and the olive oil, I could drink that olive oil as a cocktail.
For appetizer I had the grilled seafood.  It was cooked to perfection, perfectly flavorful octopus, calamari, and shrimp.  Yum!
The marinara sauce for my daughter&apos;s pasta was great.
But my entrée, the spaghetti carbonara with chopped lobster and shrimp, topped with black caviar that gave a touch of crunch... 
Carbonara has three simple ingredients but is so simple to mess it up.  This carbonara was perfect, thank you Uri.
Richard recommended Cabernet Merlot wine that was great. 
Sara, my server, you deserve a special thank you.  You are friendly, knowledgeable, and approachable, with great recommendations.  Ask for her, she is from Milan, you will feel like you&apos;re in Italy.
Even though we were satisfied, we saved some space for dessert.  The tiramisu was so delicious.  Mascarpone cheese, creamy not overly sweet with the ideal amount of coffee taste.
And this was a first.  The owner Benny, was very attentive, he, introduced me to his friends and made sure that I arrived back to my hotel door, safe and sound with my daughter.
Thank you so much Benny, Sara, Richard, uri, I will not forget about my experience, feels great during times of Covid to feel beyond great and like back to normal for a couple hours... will be back soon!!!"
5,"Not only is it the best Italian food around, it&apos;s the amazing staff that starts with Benny, the owner. He&apos;s the last great owners that still greets everyone as they walk in. He&apos;s like a father figure to many, a best friend to others, and an inspiration to me. 

The staff are  not only the best servers around, they have all become friends. Volare is more than a restaurant, it truly is a community. You will not be disappointed when reserving your table at Volare. 

A few recommendations for you to consider:

1. Ask Richard (Sommelier) for the new vintage Italian red wine 

2. Apps - full order of the Misto Griglia

3. Apps - 1 meatball for each person and half order of bolognese 

4. Dinner: Seabass and the new Wagyu NY Strip

5. The almond cheesecake 

Trust me, you will tell your friends and visit again!"
5,"Had to stop in here before the Covid restrictions went back into place! A good friend recommended this place and I&apos;m glad we went downtown to check it out.

My girlfriend ordered off the truffle menu. It was a plate of risotto, beef chunks and lots of shaved black truffle. The dish itself was Impressive to look at and even better to eat. The risotto was creamy and hard to stop eating!

I had the shell pasta and sausage with peas. This dish was also very tasty and enjoyable.

The staff here was so gracious in their service, they all were great about recommendations and checking on us.

Regarding Covid, they had a sanitizer that we walked through. All the staff were properly wearing masks, even in the kitchen! 

Can&apos;t wait to go back after the lockdown!"
4,"Could give it a 5 star because we had a reservation and still waited 45min to be seated. Yes, it was Valentine&apos;s Day weekend, but if a restaurante is expecting to be busy maybe over booking isn&apos;t the best move. That being said the food was AMAZING!!! Everything I tried was great, but my favorite was the seafood pasta . I woke up the next morning wanting that for breakfast... not sure if it was my pregnancy hormones speaking or what?! But it was GOOD!  

They also had a great COVID precautions. Upon arrival a digital machine checks your temperature followed by walking through an LED machine that disinfects you. More than I&apos;ve seen at other restaurants."
5,"Finally, I was able to go back to Volare.  The food is better than ever.  I&apos;m stuck with one of my favorite dishes, the black linguine pasta with seafood.  Absolutely amazing.  I can&apos;t wait to return.  I could eat here three times a week."
3,"I absolutely loved this place Pre-Covid, but when we returned on our engagement night there were several unpleasant things:

We had a reservation and the manager or owner greeted pleasantly and invited us in.  A+

The outdoor seating is minimal and very close to others with small heaters.  

The server congratulated us on the engagement, but that was the end of it. No Champaign or comped dessert.  Nothing to celebrate the occasion other than the 2 bottles of wine and drinks we ordered.  

Much different experience when we went to Siena Tavern after. 

The food wasn&apos;t that impressive either:

Gnocchi A
Lasagna - way too salty, gave me heart burn for HOURS.  D
Bruschetta C - eh, okay.
Calamari C somewhat skimpy.
Drinks - The wine was good, whiskey no go. B
Sausage and peppers C
Veal Parm- was a little rubbery, not bad. C-


Pasta costs $3 to make at home.  These restaurants need to step it up if they want to charge the same price with a reduced level of service.  I will not be back."
5,Always great good and great service. No nonsense  classic Italian restaurant. Nothing there is bad. Everything is always good and consistent. Large portions but you can ask for half size on pasta.
4,"One thing for sure - I&apos;ll be back!
Service, food, working concept during the pandemic was just outstanding.
Starting from the managers authentic Italian great, followed by inside seating with sterile kitchen live cooking performance view, extremely polite service (thanks Roman B) with great menu knowledge and dish proposal, delicious spaghetti Nemi, Margarita pizza as appetizer and good Old Manhattan. One thing was a bit on the dry side - sea bass. Could of been a bit softer. 
Otherwise - best experience. 

Thanks and hope to meet again."
5,"The best Italian food in Chicago, and this is from a fussy Italian gal. I highly recommend the chicken parmesan. To die for! It is simple perfection. Service is the best also. Mangia tutti!!"
5,"I was in Chicago on a business trip, and I was looking for a place to eat close to my hotel, the Embassy Suites.  It was suggested to me by the hotel to try Voltaire. I gotta tell you that it was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. My order came out fast; I had bread and olive oil on the table and chianti in my glass. If I have to come back to the city, I will definitely be paying them another visit."
2,"If you want over prices pasta, this is your spot! Wines with a twist off cost $50+ and ragú sauce is poured over pasta. 
The service on Friday evenings is terrible, where the waitress asks you first in front of your party how much you want to spend on a bottle of wine instead of providing an actual recommendation. 
The only good thing was the desert. 
Such a shame, great location and pet friendly (reason for the 2 stars)"
3,"My Volare experience wasn&apos;t very good. Our waiter neglected to share the day&apos;s specials with us. I realized after hearing him review with literally three other tables. When I brought it to his attention, he didn&apos;t seem to care. I definitely would&apos;ve ordered a special rather than the Fettuccine alla Bolognese. It was decent, but needed a lot of work. ..more garlic, more salt, more herbs.

The service threw things off for us and the food wasn&apos;t good enough to compensate. This is an old school classic Italian restaurant. I&apos;m sure the service is usually better, but that doesn&apos;t help me. There are too many options for me to revisit. The pictures make the food look better than it actually is."
5,"One of the best meals I&apos;ve had delivered during quarantine. I ordered late afternoon to try to beat the dinner rush and it came super fast! Delivery through yelp&apos;s GrubHub app was seamless, and the guy who dropped my food in the lobby was great (kept distance, contactless, etc.)! 

But importantly, the food was delicious! To my surprise, I got tons of bread (2 different kinds) with my chicken parmesan meal and it was warm and comforting and perfect. The meal itself was enough to last me 2 days too! Being extra indulgent, I topped off my order with some tiramisu, which totally hit the spot. Thanks Volare!"
5,"UGH. you actually can&apos;t beat this place. If you&apos;re in Chicago, it&apos;s a must-visit. Food 10/10, pricing is so reasonable (especially comparatively speaking) and the staff is AMAZING - seriously amazing. Nicest people I&apos;ve ever met and they go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need and are comfortable and happy. 

My roommate forgot her purse and as we were turning around to go back and grab it, one of the workers was running down the street with it - HOW sweet!"
5,"Absolutely amazing! We had the Calamari, Gnocchi, and Ravioli and it was so good! Some of the best authentic Italian food I&apos;ve had!"
5,"Gnocchi alla vodka? Yes please!

It took a minute to find this gem but once we got down the stairs we found our way. We arrived pretty early before the rush, certainly the move as we had the place to ourselves from about 5-6 before the place got packed on a weeknight!

We started with bread chatted for a while before landing on an entrée. The menu is the perfect size to be able to land on something and have enough options for everyone to choose from. Staff was friendly and helpful. Atmosphere is very nice, tablecloths and upscale décor.

I ordered the gnoochi alla vodka and a small Caesar side salad. Both were very good and it was not possible to finish everything. The sauce on the meal was the perfect balance of flavors.

I&apos;m a fan!"
5,"Every time I come and I order a different plate each time every plate that I&apos;ve tried has been extremely delicious!!! Lots of flavor &amp; fresh! Mmm mm mmm !!!
Maybe pictures can&apos;t show the deliciousness of the food when you taste!! You&apos;re blown away!!"
4,"We ate dinner at this  Italian Restaurant tonight in Chicago.  We ate out in front of the restaurant at an outside table.   My daughter ordered pizza and she said it was very good.  My husband ordered Risotto Di Mare and liked it very much. I ordered Minestrone Soup, and that was the only disappointing ordered item. It really looked like it was canned soup. Other than that, we really enjoyed our meal and good service. We had a great time eating"
4,"Ordered take out from this place and was super impressed! The portions are huge which I will never complain about. Ordered the half order of the spaghetti neri al pesce and was afraid it wouldn&apos;t feed the 2 of us, but it did and we had leftovers! Also ordered the grigliata mista and it was also a lot of food. Only con I have was that some of the food was really oily and got everywhere, but would definitely do it all over again! Can&apos;t wait to try more of their items on the menu."
4,"TL;DR 
Solid Italian food in Streeterville next to Whole Foods! Great value for Restaurant Week lunch ($24 per person).

=====

Came here for lunch during Restaurant Week. This is definitely the restaurant that gives you the most food. You get 4 courses (1 appetizer, 1 pasta, 1 main, 1 dessert), which is really enough food to be really full, plus an extra course and free bread.

The food is quite good and the presentation this year was very impressive. I ordered the octopus appetizer, the cream of eggplant bucatini, the stuffed calamari, and the ricotta torta. I liked the octopus, though it wasn&apos;t what I was expecting and it comes cold. The bucatini was very heavy on the sausage and in hindsight I should&apos;ve gone for the salmon (I tried some of my friend&apos;s and the sauce was so flavorful and red-pepper-y!). I really liked the calamari even though by then I was completely stuffed, heh. The ricotta torta was ok, and if it had more of the cream sauce I would have enjoyed it more, because without it it&apos;s a rather plain, subtly flavored chocolate cake. The tiramisu my friend ordered was very good, though I question the sprinkling of chocolate chips."
