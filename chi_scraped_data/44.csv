5,"Boka made magic!

We were celebrating my husband&apos;s birthday and a belated Thanksgiving with family members who had been on overnight hospital call for the holiday. We wanted something special and Boka didn&apos;t disappoint.

The duck was incredible! Traveled well, held up to a short rewarming, salad was delicious, and the celery root was fun. I can&apos;t say enough about the quality of the meal.

All of that said, dinner was ready for pick up right on time, they made our cocktails fresh, everything was perfect!

Thank you Boka for having the courage to remain open in challenging times! Boka helped us forget the pandemic for a bit and enjoy family and life."
5,"I&apos;m basically on a mission to try all of the 1 Michelin star restaurants in Chicago, and Boka was next on the list. Pre-COVID, I came by pretty early for a weekday dinner around 5pm and the restaurant was completely empty.

Loved the bread to start off my meal with the creamy butter. To start I went with the Grilled Spanish Octopus served with caramelized carrot and cauliflower. The octopus was incredible. So tender and not overcooked at all. For my entree, I ordered the Brown Butter Roasted Wild Striped Bass. I&apos;ve only really had brown butter pasta, but the brown butter worked so well with the fish. Wasn&apos;t expecting any complimentary dessert, but got a delicious cookie that tasted like a gingersnap and a truffle.

Service was stellar. I really hope Boka survives COVID because I can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,"I&apos;ve loved Boka since my first meal there during Restaurant Week: a delicious and elegant 4-course experience with lovely ambiance. Times are different now, but their takeout is just as impressive. We got the crispy chicken and spicy cauliflower sandwiches. The crispy chicken has a fluffy sort of crunch on the outside which I love, the inside remains tender &amp; juicy. The cauliflower is perfectly charred and flavored. Both are hugged by buttery buns. The bagged kettle chips on the side seemed extraneous - I&apos;d prefer house made chips (or no chips at all) than generic retail ones.

The kale &amp; brussels salad is huge, with sweet grapes to punctuate the flavors and textures. I&apos;m not a fan of their honey lemon dressing - too creamy and doesn&apos;t taste lemony - but it was on the side so we just replaced with our own raspberry vinaigrette. 

Overall great quality especially for the price point. Look forward to trying their other takeout items (and eventually dine in again)!"
5,"Boka just never disappoints, been here twice now. Once for my anniversary and recently for my birthday when we did the 8-course chef tasting. 

Amazing service and the food melts when you eat it. Highly recommend the wine pairing. Fun food experience at a Michelin restaurant."
4,"We came here for dinner. We had made reservations, but may have been needed during a midweek night as most of the tables weren&apos;t being occupied. The entrance to Boka is gorgeous and the dining area at the entrance was lovely and decorated beautifully. Unfortunately they sat us in another room that was more dimly lit, making difficult to take pictures. The staff was very professional and welcomed us with open arms. They worked as a team and and delivered all of our entrees very quickly. We decided to order off their a la carte menu. 

I started off with a cocktail, &quot;Patio Slippers&quot;. Though expensive and very tiny, I really enjoyed this cocktail. It came with peleton de la muerte mezcal, yellow chartreuse, fino sherry, and grilled pineapple. It was absolutely delicious, just wish it came in a bigger glass!

They start you off with a pretzel bread ball &amp; butter. The pretzel bread was hard on the outside but very soft the inside the side. The butter was perfect for this bread. 

We ordered their &quot;Ricotta Dumplings.&quot; We received four delicious dumplings stuffed with ricotta, and then covered with sweet corn, espelette and Thai basil. The basil was not overpowering but definitely present and completeness the sweetness from the corn and the creaminess from the dumpling very well. This is definitely a must try. 

My wife ordered their &quot;Roasted chicken.&quot; It came with maitake, fermented ramps, and Chinese broccoli. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and probably one of the most tender pieces of chicken I have ever eaten. I probably wouldn&apos;t order this in my own but definitely great to try. 

I ordered their &quot;Slow cooked Halibut.&quot; It came with cauliflower, uni, mussel and seaweed. The halibut was so soft and tasted very fresh. It came with so much to complement this dish perfectly. I&apos;ve had halibut plenty of times, but never prepared like this. 

We usually skip dessert, but I knew we couldn&apos;t leave without trying some at Boka. We tried their &quot;toasted almond financier.&quot;  It came with strawberries, black sesame and rose. Definitely one of the best desserts I have ever tried. You had some crunch, some creaminess, the &quot;sourness&quot; from the strawberry helps this dish out a lot. But what stood out to the me the most is the black sesame. Never would I have ever thought that sesame would go into a dessert and create just an amazing taste. I would order this again and again. 

At the end of our email, they bring out some chocolate truffles and homemade candy. Truly an amazing dining experience and will definitely be returning to check out their tasting menu."
4,"Boka is one of few restaurants earning multiple James Beard nominations and a Michelin star. We recently spent our five year anniversary at Boka and had no regrets. 

Boka is best described as urban dining with a pleasant atmosphere and carefully thought out cuisine. My husband and I ordered from their tasting menu which I highly recommend if you&apos;re willing to keep an open mind and sample the best the chef has to offer. 

Our 5 course tasting menu was worth every penny and we added the ricotta dumplings as an additional course (which I highly suggest not passing up!) With a couple additional dessert add-ons from the chef, our 5 course dinner easily stretched out to 8! Each course provides a tasting (roughly 3-6 bites). Initially you may think it&apos;s a small amount of food but by the time our second dessert came out, I was prepared to throw in the towel! In short, dinner was not only amazing but every beautifully executed course had a complex flavor profile with the next dish being totally different from the last.

Our reservation was set for 7:30 and by the time we finished; it was nearly 10pm! I enjoyed how we didn&apos;t feel rushed. I&apos;m naturally a slow eater so the extra time gave me an opportunity to enjoy each savory bite. Due to COVID, seating is limited and I appreciate the staff spacing out the tables (both indoors and on the patio) to allow ample space between you and other patrons.

Our server Brandon was jovial and accommodating. As the night progressed, there was a storm coming in. We initially made reservations on the patio but as the rain steadily came down, he offered to move us to a booth inside. Everyone we encountered, from the moment we placed our reservation, up to departure has been nothing but pleasant.  We each left with a raspberry coffee cake as a nice parting gift from the chef. We had a wonderful time at Boka and it&apos;s definitely worth looking into if you&apos;re planning a formal dining experience."
5,"This is hands down the best meal that I&apos;ve ever had in my life. we went for my husband&apos;s birthday, which I mentioned when making a reservation, and they printed a personalized happy birthday menu with his name on it as well as giving a complimentary dessert and glass of champagne. 
I think that I will dream about the ricotta pillows every day for the rest of my life. Great sommelier service, knowledgeable waitstaff, and delicious food &amp; wine."
5,"If I could give Boka more than five stars I would. Alinea majorly f#%ed up my reservation and didn&apos;t give a shit. My boyfriend suggested Boka and we booked the five course dinner with wine pairing. It was absolutely delicious and delightful and unlike Alinea, they actually were professional.

We started with a chamomile cocktail. This lead to a sea urchin appetizer. I will say, I am not normally a fan of sea urchin but this was incredible. We continued on to a shrimp appetizer. Wow, these were quite literally the best shrimp I have consumed. So sweet, almost creamy. To die for. Next was a halibut entree that was poached in olive oil. So soft and the fried squash blossoms were an excellent accompaniment. We then had lamb two ways and both ways were outstanding. To finish we had a chocolate cherry pot de creme. A decadent way to finish the evening but of course we were served some chocolates and had some loaves of raspberry bread to take home too.

All the wine pairings were spot on and the atmosphere was relaxing and more casual than I had expected. The service was stellar and I can&apos;t wait to come back."
5,"I just ordered the boka pastries box over the weekend with the Bellini! It was exactly what I needed on a lazy Saturday morning! My top two pastries would have to be the cranberry poptart and the peppermint mocha croissant. I&apos;m a fillings girls so both of these pastries just had the most delicious fillings I&apos;m trying to hold my self back from ordering it again this weekend as well. The Bellini was also delicious, I love hibiscus so it was very light and refreshing!"
5,"Boka has quickly become my fav go-to spot for event dinings. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday some months ago and we absolutely loved it. We now come back regularly for birthdays, anniversaries, etc. They have a very charming atmosphere and the staff is always so friendly and welcoming. If you can, I would highly recommend coming for the unique menu during restaurant week as well!"
5,"My husband ordered a dinner for Chanukah this year. The smoked fish spread for an appetizer over dark rye toast was delicious. We left NONE of it. The matzo ball soup surpassed in richness of flavor and the lightness and taste of the matzo balls to the soup my mother-in-law used to make and hers was superb. The brisket was tender and flavorFULL, the potato latkes okay (the only slightly disappointing part of the meal) and the beans were done to perfection, ready to be heated through but still crisp. Finally the loaf of challah was too small, but only because it was so delicious, much better than the best bakery in our area. They topped the meal with a honey apple upsidedown cake we ate slowly to make it last.
Will I order from Boka again? Absolutely!"
5,"Phenomenal. That&apos;s the perfect word to describe my experience at Boka. What a dinner. It&apos;s easy to see why chef Lee Wolen has been nominated a few times for James Beard awards.

Boka will run you a pretty penny, but man it is easily 110% worth it. I came here to celebrate Valentine&apos;s day and the environment is definitely intimate enough for it. 

We ordered the Ricotta Dumplings, Tajarin, Roasted Beef Short Rib, a Whole Roasted Dry Aged Duck for one, and the Hazelnut &amp; Coffee dessert. Every single dish was out-freaking-standing. 

The Ricotta dumplings were stuffed to the point of bursting with the cheese. They also graciously divided the dish into two servings so my girlfriend and I each got a bowl of 3. The sauce that it comes with is slightly sweet, which pairs well with the creaminess of the Ricotta. 

The Tajarin was another creamy dish; a bowl of noodles with some black truffle on top. Overall a very simple, but well executed plate. The noodles were cooked to a perfect al dente and had a beautiful bite. 

The Roasted Beef Short Rib was incredible, probably THE most tender short rib I&apos;ve ever had in my life. I was almost shocked at the texture of it. 

The duck for one is prepared in two different ways, one emphasizing the crispy skin, the other a Tajine-style dish focusing on the dark meat. I love the crispiness of duck skin and it was cooked perfectly at Boka. Not my favorite preparation of duck skin (that&apos;s reserved for Peking Duck) but still a very memorable dish. The Tajine was also delicious, a duck stew almost. It was creamy and had just a hint of sweetness. Both versions of duck were absolutely wonderful. 

The Hazelnut &amp; Coffee was beautiful; getting a full bite with the milk ice cream, praline, and delicate, wafer-like topping was an impressive mixture of flavors and textures. One of better desserts I have ever had. 

They do give you some cute chocolates to end the meal, along with some amuse bouche at the beginning to start; those seem to vary based on the seasons, so I wouldn&apos;t go into much detail about them other than that they are also delicious. 

I would overwhelmingly recommend Boka. It&apos;s a unique dining experience that really encapsulates the best of Chicago&apos;s amazing restaurant scene."
4,"With some free time on hand with this quarantine, I finally get a chance to talk about my experience here at Boka. We came during restaurant week, we reserved a table pretty early, otherwise reservations could be pretty tough.
The location is a little awkward I must say. Its on Halsted st. kind of hidden. But as soon as you walk in, your greeted with a beautiful restaurant. We waited at the bar till our table was ready. The bartender made some amazing drinks! We went with the pre-fixe menu. Everything was delicious although nothing really stood out. The portions were small, but the flavors were unique, and deff make you feel you are eating at a Michelin star spot. The highlight of boka is deff the service. It might be some of the best in the city!"
5,"This will be a short review... BOKA&apos;s Michelin star obviously can speak for itself.

The decor can be best described as &apos;moody fairytale&apos;. Across from me was a brick wall with a cursive inscription of an Oscar Wilde quote. The restaurant is an ecclectic mix of glass,  brick, tropical plants, and victorian portraits (you&apos;ll see).

I came here for restaurant week and ordered Kampachi (cold), Rigatoni (hot), Pork Tenderloin &amp; Belly (entree), and Chocolate Mousse (dessert). More detailed descriptions included in the pictures below. 

My favorite dish was the rigatoni with mushroom bolognese; so much flavor and the perfect amount of cheese and saltiness. I sincerely hope it&apos;s on their regular menu so I can enjoy the masterpiece again! 

Despite only having a taste of my friend&apos;s roasted chicken, I can tell you that it also tasted phenomenal. It was described as &quot;stand out&quot; by our waitress and I regret I didn&apos;t get the hint. No worries, it&apos;ll be my entree next time. 100%.

Grateful my friend chose BOKA for our restaurant week get-together. Food, atmosphere, and company all add up to a 5 star rating from me!  

Not as short of a review as I had planned, my bad (:"
5,"We came here to celebrate! 

The service at the restaurant was very professional and appropriate given  the COVID-times. All the tables are extremely distanced from each-other and the servers really respect your space and will not serve you until you have a mask on as well. 

The food was a great experience and journey.. we each did the tasting menu and it was 6-courses (4-savory dishes with 2-dessert) that night rather than the typical 5-course. We got a couple of cocktails and they were very well balanced (not too sweet or sour). The server asks you several questions to understand what type of food you are open or not open to eating to better tailor the meal. We also ordered the Dry Aged Beef Tartare to add the meal and it was excellent.. plenty of umami flavor!

We would definitely come back, but there are also so many amazing meals to try out there! Thanks again for the amazing experience Boka!"
5,"Second visit after many years, still for restaurant week. Love the dark dining room, very classy and elegant. We started out with a warm, soft complimentary roll with dill and sea salt. Delish! 

I started with the foie gras, which was a pile of silky shaved foie gras that melts on your tongue. It&apos;s decadent but I thought it&apos;d benefit from some crusty bread to cut through the richness. Hubby&apos;s grilled beets was fine, I love beets but it seems there&apos;s only so much you can do with it.

Next course was roasted bass for me and rigatoni for him. I really wanted to switch plates because the rigatoni was perfectly al dente with a creamy sauce. Although to be fair my bass was cooked perfectly, just reaching flakiness and super delicate. I didn&apos;t like the glob of brown mousse though, tasted rather bland and didn&apos;t do anything for the dish.

Entree I got fish again, the salmon was just barely cooked though with crispy skin. Love the crisp tender cauliflower and buttery purée. Hubby&apos;s pork tenderloin &amp; belly was no slouch either, so tender and rich.

Ended with yuzu dessert, doesn&apos;t look pretty but flavor was spot on and very refreshing. Almost wish it were summer outside (in which case I&apos;d easily chow down several bowls of this). Hubby&apos;s hazelnut &amp; coffee was not only beautifully plated, the flavor combination makes it the best dessert we&apos;ve had thus far in 2020! Also got to try the chocolate mousse, which was fine but pales in comparison to the hazelnut &amp; coffee. 

Service was very efficient, our water glasses never empty. But personally I thought the meal was a bit rushed for a restaurant of this caliber. I wanted to linger in that beautiful dining room! It was Super bowl Sunday but the place was packed, with back to back reservations. There&apos;s a reason why they&apos;re so popular. Go!"
2,"So I&apos;ll start by saying that the experience wasn&apos;t bad, it was just not memorable. I think the food was ok and the atmosphere was also ok, but this isn&apos;t a restaurant I would bookmark. Especially when you&apos;re shelling out the big bucks for a nice place, you should be selective about which to go to, and I have to say, for me at least, that I don&apos;t think I&apos;d return here.

To start if you take a look at my pictures, you&apos;ll see that the size of the dishes far exceed the size of the food. Ok, that&apos;s not bad if it tastes good, right? If I&apos;m being honest, I couldn&apos;t tag the name of the appetizers because I forgot what they tasted like and what they were. The bread they serve you is really good, however. Try to ask for more pieces if you can.

Now, the two dishes I do remember were the entrees. My boyfriend and I both shared a short rib and an order of the roasted chicken. Both were.... again, ok at best. I like the tenderness of the rib, but for around $40 that is possibly one of the tiniest portions of an entree I&apos;ve ever seen. The chicken although good (and what Boka is known for) was ok by chicken standards. I mean I have to say that I prefer chicken elsewhere for a much cheaper price.

Overall, an ok restaurant food-wise but when you tack on the price, I&apos;d say your money is better spent elsewhere."
5,We visited Boka on the evening of our engagement. My fiancé paid for the coursed dinner and drink pairing ahead of time and it went extremely smooth. The food was incredible and all of it left us wanting more. The service was splendid and the staff did a great job of being attentive while keeping their distance because you know- covid. They even gave us printed menus with a congratulations on them and a little pastry gift bag. The attention to detail was so sweet. We will definitely be back!
4,"Straight to the point menu, food is good and tasty.   The staff was very professional and friendly. Entrees were delivered very quickly. I do recommend the beef tartare.
The duck and chicken mains were tasty and cooked well!

They do have COVID-19 measures in place, keeping you and the staff safe."
4,"I returned to boka to try their tasting menu. This is merely my 2nd attempt at a tasting menu it &amp; Twas was pretty much like my first experience, to me some dishes were mediocre, some were delicious  &amp; merely one thing was spectacular. At $150 per person it wasn&apos;t uber expensive but I think I&apos;m done with tasting menus. A couple of the dishes were on the regular menu also. The cocktails were good not great. Scallop &amp; caviar dish was ok. The halibut was extremely delicious &amp; the best version of it I&apos;ve ever had.  Oysters were good. Duck was mediocre. Palate cleanser was course worthy. The dessert was mind boggling. The flavors were extremely complex, ingredients were packed with a powerful punch. The back patio is cute to say the least &amp; the restaurant itself is decorated well."
