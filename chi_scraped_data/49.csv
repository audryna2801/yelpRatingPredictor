5,"Tl;dr: I went on a date here and I loved it! Favorite place to date (yes, all the puns and double entendres. All of them)

First of all, parking can stress you out. While they do have valet, I don&apos;t really want anyone in my car right now. So, I circled about 5 times until I found a space two blocks away. 

While he opted to sit on the patio, plenty of people headed inside. FYI, they are taking temperatures at the door. So, if you have a fever but you&apos;ve just GOTTA have Sunda, they&apos;ll find you. 

To start, we had veganized, gluten free miso cauliflower. It was INCREDIBLE. It doesn&apos;t ordinarily come like that but the chef was enlightened and did a wonderful job. Our waiter also brought out tamari sauce without me asking. There are thinkers working here. 

He had steamed buns / half chicken and half eggplant. Pretty sure he was pleased. I had a fish free poke bowl with sweet potato. While it was decent, it had the most rice I think I&apos;ve ever had in my life. Why are people so in love with poke bowls? Yeah, I&apos;ve got FOMO NO MO (Sorry, Lol). No more food trends. 

Bottom line: here you&apos;ll get impeccable service, quality food and common sense. Plus, theres a big man at the door armed with a thermometer. 

It was a perfect experience, minus the parking. I would definitely return."
5,"In order to appease covid-19 restrictions, the restaurant has opened up an impromptu patio seating which maps the sidewalk on two sides of the building. Tables are socially distant but seating was ample. They are requesting reservations, but we called 30 minutes ahead and they were able to accommodate our party of two.

This was our first time trying out Sunda&apos;s southeast asian tapas fair, and it did not disappoint! The showstopper for me was my peared sake cocktail rimmed with cinnamon but each different small plate we tried was just as delicious. The pork belly steamed buns were especially delicious!"
5,"Sunda is our favorite Asian-Fusion fine dining in the city of Chicago. Hands down.

Service and ambiance are spectacular. The staff work as a team to ensure the most outstanding dining experience possible amidst a chic and beautifully decorated/designed dining space. You will never feel not taken care of at Sunda!

The cocktails are outstanding! There are many creative signatures only at Sunda that you have to try. But during our last visit, I got a classic Manhattan and it was outstanding. Sunda can deliver both the creative signatures AND the tried and true classics!

The food is EVERYTHING! We&apos;ve tried many appetizers and LOVE the steamed buns and lumpia best of all! We can never NOT get an appetizer. Make sure you go hungry and prepared for leftovers!

We&apos;ve tried many entrees and you CANNOT GO WRONG! Everything is creative, flavorful, presented beautifully, and with the finest ingredients. Go with your gut and come back again and again to try new things! It will always be worth it!

However, my husband and I are obsessed with the Szechuan dinner! We always have to get one Szechuan chicken entree because it is PERFECT and unlike anything else! We even had a visit where we both got it because we didn&apos;t want to share! 

In fact, this review was inspired by my hunger pangs for the Szechuan chicken specifically during this time of Coronavirus Quarantine. I literally had an insatiable craving for the Szechuan chicken last night laying in bed. I told my husband and he groaned because he was then immediately craving it as well! 

We cannot wait for this time to be over so that we can go to Sunda one of our first possible meals! Praying it is soon!"
4,"you (can do the build you own poke bowl for dinner change that plz) ambiance: really nice n big service: was alright special wish they would clean tables be more hospitable and describe however they did make my moms birthday special with a card  a cake (the cake was not delicious  plz give ice cream or an actual dessert but it was bad) dishes. Food:  the issue is the menus so big that u cant make everything did if they just made 2 pages instead of six food would taste better n be more consistent n if they picked a theme like Japanese  sushi instead of  Asian etc.  food be better. The hot food was tasteless. The sushi was a hit or miss the overall theme was they all needed salt good sushi does not need soy sauce best things: ESCOLAR &quot;THE GREAT WHITE&quot;/TUNA TRUFFLE PIZZA $24

HAMACHI MARROW $16
seared yellowtail, roasted garlic bone marrow, smoked salt: this I  did not like did not think it was flavorful and did not taste any bone marrow or garlic worst sushi of the nite

UNAGI FOIE $18
seared foie gras, tempura unagi, unagi sauce, yuzu marmalade, sesame seeds, kaiware: foie was good quality and adds decadence but the sauce was way to sweet n there was to much overwhelmed the foie and the eel so id put more foie n balance out all the sweetness


ESCOLAR &quot;THE GREAT WHITE&quot;
escolar, truffle shavings, potato chip $12:  really tasty loved the chip for crunch wish there was more truffle n it was fresh truffle but was so rich


TUNA TRUFFLE PIZZA $24
roti pasta, black truffle, foie gras aioli, red onion, truffle tare. delicious but the pizza crust was garbage it was like a flour tortilla plz use something crunchy plz the aioli was amazing just plz use more there is just like one piece and needs more truffle


 
sliced domestic wagyu, oxtail, bone marrow, rice noodles, sprouts, thai basil, mint, cilantro, chilies $24: had the pho flavor but had no depth n oxtail was really fatty n bone marrow did not have a lot of marrow was overly charred loved the raw beef in it. Just the soup was not supper hot it was like above luke warm wish there was more cilantro and basil just was not good n wasnt worse the price


DRUNKEN NOODLES $22
tiger shrimp, beef, baby corn, kai-lan, bell peppers, basil: the shrimp n beef was perfectly cooked but there were so many bell peppers idk why they add lot of bitterness. My issue was the sauce was way to sweet. And the noodles were really overcooked

GARLIC CRAB NOODLES $24
longevity noodles, garlic butter, blue crab, scallions, fried garlic: this could have had more taste  it was really dry needs more sauce and there was a lot of crab shell in it. Its just an alfredo with crab nothing special"
3,"So, I didn&apos;t dine in. But instead I had this delivered to me. Due to delivery delays, the quality of the food wasn&apos;t  too good.

I ordered Seoul wings &amp; Steamed Buns Pork belly. The pork belly buns, they were decent. The buns don&apos;t have much of a taste. The pork belly was super hard &amp; one of those o my had straight fat. The buns were still in good condition. 

I also ordered the Seoul wings. I didn&apos;t expect it to be that spicy, but they were spicier than I expected. They were a good spice though. The chicken itself, super dry &amp; hard. It might be factored in with the 1+ hour delivery, but other than that, it was okay. 

I&apos;d love to go in and give it a second try when covid is over."
5,"I decided to come back and give Sunda a 2nd chance and I was very impressed; so much that I&apos;m changing my review!

This time I ordered the Sweet Potato Caterpillar Roll and it was phenomenal! The flavor profile is exquisite and the roll is quite filling. I also got the Vegan Pad Thai noodles which were very well seasoned and up to par!"
5,"Came here with some friends to try a bunch of different plates. This restaurant is like asian food but tapas style. Love the concept and the food was delicious. We got 7 dishes for the 6 of us and it was just the right amount of food.. I definitely could have eaten more, but I was a good full.

Crispy Brussels sprouts salad (5/5): Delicious and flavorful. One of my favorite dishes we ate.

Lumpia (3/5): This dish is on their secret menu (meaning you have to know to ask for it) and I wanted to try it because I read good things. It came with 12 little pieces and it was really good, but honestly nothing special. I wouldn&apos;t get again.

Beef lollipops (4/5): This is another signature dish on the secret menu. I was intrigued and wanted to try it. Really fun concept but the meat was ok. This is another dish I&apos;m glad I tried, but wouldn&apos;t get again.

Pork belly bao buns (5/5): I may be bias because I love pork belly baos and there&apos;s was really yummy.

Wagyu crispy rice (5/5): Came with 4 little bites of crispy rice with the wagyu on top. This was the table favorite.

Crazy rice (5/5): I was surprised this was one of my favorites because I was thinking it&apos;s just fried rice.... but it was honestly some of the most flavorful fried rice I&apos;ve ever had. Still thinking about it.

Red Dragon roll (4/5): great sized roll and really good but nothing mind blowing about it. 

I would definitely come back!"
5,"Yum, yum, yum!!! I cannot even get over how good the food is here. I came here for my younger brothers birthday and the staff and ambience was wonderful. Our waitress was super bubbly and kind. She helped us navigate through the menu and made jokes with us. The restaurant was also very clean! Me and my family loved the Dragon Roll here. Definitely give this place a shot if you&apos;re in the neighborhood!"
5,"Thank you Sunda for providing the Service Industry with complimentary meals last night, it was very appreciated! It was honestly the best Szechuan Chicken I have ever had!"
3,"Between the hype and the prices, we had high expectations for our meal here. We were really craving sushi, so we just ordered 3 rolls. 

We started with the Panda roll with shrimp tempura and cream cheese, and it was easily in the top 3 sushi rolls either of us have ever had. The crunch of the tempura was fantastic, and the roll was incredibly rich and melted in your mouth, without being too heavy. The sauces on top, particularly the wasabi aioli, also tied it together perfectly. 

After such a great beginning, we were really disappointed by our next two rolls. We had the crispy salmon roll which was most disappointing because it wasn&apos;t crispy whatever. There was no texture variation and also no jalapeño, as promised in the menu. It was really just bland and fell flat. We also had the sweet potato caterpillar roll, with sweet potato, pear, and avocado. The blackened garlic teriyaki was unique, but the roll really needed some crunch as it felt very mushy. I think sweet potato tempura would have been much better than roasted sweet potato. I also could not taste the pear at all. 

The atmosphere is great and the service is fantastic. However, for the price, I&apos;m not sure I would come back, considering we only loved 1 of 3 things that we ordered."
5,"Great spot and ambience, and loved that they take reservations. The dragonfly sushi is delicious, and we also enjoyed the crispy Brussels sprouts (huge portion)."
5,"Top notch service and ambience along with delicious Asian fare. Perfect for a date night or otherwise- beautiful bar and innovative drinks. The sushi menu is extensive and vegetarians have plenty of options- even veg sushi. 
Run .. don&apos;t walk to this joint but remember to make reservations first!"
4,"Came here for dinner with my family to celebrate my golden birthday. This was my second time here, but I don&apos;t remember the first time because it was over 5 years ago The overall restaurant is beautiful inside. The outside doesn&apos;t have much to see, but when you walk inside its very modern and refreshing.

This place resonates with me because its a fusion of foods from all over Southeast Asia, including the Philippines (I&apos;m filipino lol). For 6 people, we ordered a total of 12 dishes plus 1 complimentary birthday dessert. Everything came out beautifully and in a nicely spaced out manner where we could thoroughly enjoy each dish without being overwhelmed. 

I LOVE brussels sprouts so of course we got the salad. Oh my it was so delicious I&apos;m pretty sure I could&apos;ve eaten it as my main course. Touches of crispiness and exploding flavors! My other favorite dishes were the oxtail pot stickers and the tiger shrimp tempura. When you bite into the pot stickers, it&apos;s completely filled with the most tender meat. The tiger shrimp tempura tasted like gourmet walnut shrimp from Panda Express. The one roll we got (red dragon roll) was super good too, but be careful because the sauce it comes with was spicy even for me.

For dessert, we ordered 3 for the table and my mom asked if they could put a candle on the Sunda sundae for my birthday. They came out with the 3 that we ordered plus a complimentary dessert for my birthday!! It was a great surprise! I&apos;m not sure what the complimentary cake was but it tasted like butter cake and I can say that it was the favorite of the table. Don&apos;t expect the Sunda sundae to be anything like a real halo-halo. I was kind of disappointed because there was no shaved ice so it ended up being super milky from all the ice cream. The almond pudding? I was not a fan. And you can never go wrong with a mochi ice cream flight.

We came when it was the weekend of lunar new year and during dinner, they had a dragon show in the restaurant. Dragons danced throughout the restaurant while musicians were playings the drums and mini gongs. The manager went around the whole restaurant and gave every customer a traditional chinese red envelope that contained a coupon for something free! My family had a great time with great hospitality!"
5,"This place is awesome for upscale Asian fusion.

When you go ask for Manny! He really took care of us! We had so many questions and he had an answer for everything! 

Everything Manny suggested was more than amazing. 

The Wagyu &amp; lobster roll was basically better than sex 

The pho braised beef had so much umami I wish we ended the meal woth this because your flavor palette is maxed out after eating this.

And the honey vanilla butter molten cake was basically the dish that put me in a diabetic coma and I&apos;m writing this review from the beyond. That&apos;s how good it was. But everything on the menu is worth it. 

Perfect place to impress anyone with your culinary cuisine acumen.

I would go back again and again and again.

5,"I couldn&apos;t praise the staff more for dealing with terrible circumstanes. Tock as an order mechanism sucked, more than a dozen people waited for meals not ready, snow fell and Chicago&apos;s finest came out on foot to ticket waiting cars at $70 a pop . Great to see them in such a crisis, right?
The staff and customers were nothing but kind and patient despite this. Not exactly sure of the food as I never got any but my family ate it up quick and gave it 4 stars!"
4,"I have been to Sunda twice over the last year for work-related dinner functions in a private event space, so my own experience may not be that of the typical customer here.  However both times I have certainly enjoyed my experiences at Sunda.  The dining areas on the main floor seemed to be quite busy and crowded, so it was a relief for our groups that the events were housed in lovely and secluded areas.  The &quot;new Asian&quot; cuisine served at Sunda looks pricey, but the food selections I have tried are quite good. 

When I went the first time the food was basically passed appetizers, while the second time the food was served family style at group tables.  Both times the food was served efficiently in such a fashion that we did not really miss anything in regards to the corporate presentations that we were attending, so a big shout-out goes to the staff at Sunda for such seamlessly stellar service.  

Among the array of appetizers, I have sampled the steamed bao buns with yummy fillings of pork belly and duck, savory oxtail pot stickers, Asian pear salad, Thai lemongrass with chicken and shrimp and seemingly a hundred other ingredients, and surprisingly flavorful miso cauliflower.  We tried three types of sushi, and they were all quite tasty.  Other dishes included a noodle dish (veggie pancit canton) with a bit of tofu, a salmon dish with mushrooms, and a filet mignon dish with peppers and onions that to me was the weakest dish I have tasted there.  Perhaps I had a vision of a whole steak, and this particular dish featured cut up pieces of steak that included some non-edible bits.  Fortunately that was a minor quibble, as Sunda is a fine restaurant to try out if you or someone you know has the bucks to dine there."
3,"The food was great tasting, the service was good, and the ambiance was good. My main issue is that our crispy brussel sprout salad had a big fat rubber band in it. Ew. It really freaked me out when I picked up my chopsticks to see a rubber band. I brought it up and the waiter apologized once but didn&apos;t offer to bring us a new one and didn&apos;t take it off the bill. I was disappointed."
3,"Great location! I loved the atmosphere inside. There was lots of natural lighting and open space with the new Asian flare. We grabbed our order to go so this review is in reference to that.

We were greeted when we walked in and directed to the bar to order our to-go order. The bar tender was welcoming and gave us some waters while we waited. We each selected what we wanted and she split the bill for us according to what we ordered. The food came out pretty fast! I would say about 10-15 minutes from the time we ordered. 

I ordered the Sunda Bento Box, Chicken Inasal. The chicken dish was made with vinegar, lemongrass, garlic, cherry tomatoes, red onion,
achiote glaze, chili lime sauce, &amp; grilled lemon. The box came with a seaweed salad, miso soup, and a choice of four pieces of spicy tuna,
avocado &amp; cucumber or California roll. Seemed like an awesome deal! 

However, once we looked in our bags when we got back to the office, our salads and sushi rolls were missing. HUGE bummer because we wanted to try everything. The miso soup had a good flavor but was room temperature. Our walk to the office was 5 minutes so I thought it would have still been hot. The chicken portion was okay. The flavors were there but it was missing something. 

They ended up refunding our meals because they forgot two items in our &quot;box&quot; so they at least have great customer service. I&apos;d give this place another shot and hope it&apos;s a better experience overall next time!"
5,"The energy and atmosphere is a 10! Love the vibe at Sunda. Great drinks, great menu and fantastic service. A bit pricey but worth it!"
5,"Literally one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to! The food quality is consistent, the service is superb, and the atmosphere is trendy and modern. I have been here for group events, celebrating my own birthday, and on a date with my boyfriend, each time has been amazing! 

Every time I come here, I am usually parked in a different part of Chicago and uber or lyft here. I do not drive around this area, especially around dinner time because parking is such a hassle. 

Sunda, itself, is a beautiful restaurant with modern décor. Upon walking in, you will see the hostess and their front staff going over reservations and helping incoming guests. There is a small seating area by the large windows with high tops, followed by the area at the bar. Then there is a large, spacious seating area filled with high tops and regular seating. In the back, there are party rooms and large tables. To the left of the stairs, there is a seating area across from the sushi chefs. I prefer to eat at the bar, or one of the high tops by the windows. Please call ahead and make reservations for large groups! You will be accommodated!

My usual dishes are:

1) Crispy brussels sprouts - $17 - this is the BEST salad! Also, a popular dish here. The vinaigrette really ties the brussels sprouts, red cabbage, carrots, and veggies together. This dish is large, I have shared it with up to 4 people. 
2) Tiger Shrimp Tempura - $18 - If you like shrimp, please give this dish a try! The shrimp is fried, paired with candied walnuts and coated in this finger licking creamy honey aioli!! What is not to love?! 
3) Red Dragon - $24 -Tasty sushi with shrimp tempura and spicy tuna. 
4) Edamame - $5 - great appetizer to start your delicious meal. 
5) Blackberry Limeade - $15 - This AMAZING drink is made with effen vodka and fresh blackberries! I have personally seen the bartender muddle the berries! This drink is so refreshing and delicious! 

On my date with my boyfriend, we also ordered the Panang chicken ($20), which is a coconut milk-based curry, with vegetables, potatoes, peanuts, and served with white rice. It was tasty, but I don&apos;t think I will be ordering it again. 

Lastly, the molten chocolate cake ($12) is a warm chocolate cake with fudgy, gooey chocolate under cold vanilla ice cream! YUM! This is perfect for someone with a sweet tooth!"
