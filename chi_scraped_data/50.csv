5,"*BEFORE LOCKDOWN

I came here on a Sunday evening with a friend. I ordered a Reuben sandwich with a side of sweet potatoes and my friend and I split a chocolate shake.

I should mention I hate chocolate shakes. I like chocolate, but I don&apos;t like chocolate in certain things like donuts and cakes. (I know I know I&apos;m weird). But this shake tasted awesome, I was impressed!

On another note, I&apos;m not a fan of Reuben sandwiches, but this was highly rated and it&apos;s vegan, so I&apos;m sure it tastes different than the norm. Oh my god, this Reuben tasted AMAZING! Zero complaints. Everything just tasted bomb. I was really blown away by its taste and couldn&apos;t believe it was vegan. I can&apos;t wait to bring my visiting guests here! I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll be blown away too.

I also ordered food for delivery through caviar and the driver mentioned he forgot another bag. CD was prompt with notifying me and apologizing for the order. They reimbursed me for the wings and the second transaction. I&apos;m grateful for their customer service. 

I highly recommend this place for not only the food but for their customer service!"
5,"After many years of wanting to try Chicago Diners Thanksgiving dinner, covid gave me the chance. With nowhere to go and no big indulgent meal ahead, I ordered 2 meals so I could enjoy leftovers. The roast was pretty good, but the wellington was the star. I wish they made it for Christmas! 

All the included sides were good as well, though they his have been more substantial. The extra side of mashed potatoes was excellent."
5,"Absolutely immaculate so good. On time delivery, no issues with my order. Literally no reason not to order."
3,"Chicago Diner offers many options for those wanting something different or transitioning to a vegan diet. I purchased their Thanksgiving meal plan. I ordered each entree a roast, lentil loaf, and Wellington I believe. 

I enjoyed the lentil loaf, truffle mushroom gravy, string beans, and potatoes. As for the other items I will not be ordering them ever again. 

They have enhanced C-19 restrictions so please place your order online or call ahead. They limit the amount of people inside and require all guest to wear a mask."
5,"I liked it! Street parking on Halsted (meter pay).

This place is vegan, some of the menu item names almost make it seem like it isn&apos;t, but everything is vegan friendly. 

I&apos;m not a vegan but I thought this place was good. Our spicy Thai chili wings were great and our chocolate peanut butter shake was tasty as well. Enjoyed both.

The Reuben and the Buddha burger were both good. The burger (sweet potato and tofu) was a little dry, next time I&apos;ll try the soul bowl. But both were good and I enjoyed tasting both.

Great place!"
2,"Over price , vegetarian but greasy .. so what&apos;s the point . It does taste good though."
4,"I am saying 4 stars because the vegans I was with loved it. I am not a vegan. I don&apos;t care for plant based proteins or soy anything but my friends, they do. And if you do too, well, you&apos;ll frickin&apos; love it."
5,"Two words: SEITAN. WINGS. I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but I loooooove their seitan wings. Almost better than the actual thing. My favorite flavor is their buffalo. It&apos;s a huge portion so I usually order that as my main course. While Chicago Diner isn&apos;t part of my usual rotation, I love when a vegetarian/vegan friend comes to town and needs to place that we both can enjoy. Chicago Diner is always at the top of that list!  

Every time I&apos;ve dined at Chicago Diner it&apos;s been a pleasurable experience. The place is popular so be prepared to wait. The staff are always super nice and happy to walk you through the menu since everything is vegetarian and vegan, they&apos;re happy to make  recommendations. Other menu items I&apos;ve tried and enjoyed include the reuben, gyro, and black bean burger. So basically anything made with their seitan. It&apos;s seriously the best! The only thing of theirs I&apos;ve tried and didn&apos;t like was their cheese. Vegan cheese just ain&apos;t for me. After writing this review, I&apos;ve suddenly got a craving. Whether you&apos;re vegan or not, check this place out! It&apos;s a Chicago institution for a reason."
5,Milkshakes are to die for!! The mint chocolate chip is phenomenal! Haven&apos;t had anything from here that wasn&apos;t good! Everytime we&apos;re around the area we make it a point to stop here. Well done Chicago Diner!!
4,"Tonight, dinner was my choice so I went with our old faithful, Chicago Diner.

We should have cheated.

Look, this place still has the same, cozy, alternative vibe but the food was just meh tonight.

Kudos to them for attempting to be inclusive; I&apos;m gluten free, another person is soy free, two kids, etc. Every menu possible was at our table. We didn&apos;t even have to ask! 

Our waiter was cool. But, as the evening wore on, he got clumsier and messier and more forgetful. A toddler in our party remarked, &quot;He forgets everything.&quot; I wish he heard it. 

Starters:
2 cups of coconut curry: a surprise hit. It doesn&apos;t have the depth of Thai coconut curry but it does its own thing and I respect it. Definitely try it. 

Seitan wings (shared): not for the gluten free but apparently a mandatory item on each visit.

Drinks:
Lemonade: Heard nothing. From kids, that&apos;s a good sign.
Water: which, thanks to our waiter, wound up on someone&apos;s cell phone and on the floor. Never got refilled.
Vanilla Milkshake: Tasty. Also, wow at the sugar.  The vanilla chai is more memorable but has been scrapped for some reason. 

Entrees:
Enchiladas de Mole: light on the butternut squash. Saut√©ed mushrooms were a pleasant touch. The refried beans &amp; the enchiladas were in dire need of salt.
Tofu stir fry (not pictured): very rice heavy but great spices. 
Quesadilla &amp; waffle fries (kids menu): dairy cheese. Apparently good. Kid finished everything.
Chicken fingers &amp; waffle fries (kids menu): barely nibbled, got taken to go. 
Three soy free sides &amp; gluten free bread that was supposed to be ciabatta, actually. That person was disappointed. 

Oh, and a waiter sporting a Black Lives Matter t-shirt, grinned and nodded at our table a few times.

K, thanks? Lol 

As for the clumsy waiter, the mistakes continued. No offer to comp anything. He even tried to make us pay for bread we didn&apos;t order (his mistake) and he forgot a hot tea. Didn&apos;t forget to bring the check though. 

Times change, people change and apparently Chicago Diner changes. Good to know. Thanks for the good times!"
5,"So my wife is a vegetarian and I try to eat plant based most of the time, and we love this spot. They don&apos;t have meat here but you can get cheese if you want. 

We LOVE the seitan wings with buffalo sauce. Now, for those of you who aren&apos;t aware, seitan is pure gluten so stay away if your intolerant, but if you like bread, seitan is the best part about bread in a concentrated form to imitate meat, and it does a pretty good job. You won&apos;t mistake it for meat probably, but it makes a solid meatless wing.

They use the same thing on the Cuban sandwich which is what I&apos;m having now. Every dish I&apos;ve had is well done, and tastes great. Plant based doesn&apos;t have to mean bland. I challenge all meat eaters to give it a shot at least once, you might like it."
4,"It&apos;s a small place but has pretty good food and it&apos;s vegan which is great for my girlfriend because it&apos;s her favorite place. Parking can sometimes be an issue because it can be very busy down there and sometimes there is plenty of parking, they have parking to the side of their building but it is VERY narrow. Got takeout and the food was good but not milk did they not give us any utensils but also NO NAPKIN. Didn&apos;t realize you had to ask for that stuff which was kind of a bummer because we ate our food in a nearby park and afterward had dirty hands and fingers. Got fries and they didn&apos;t put any ketchup in the bag but we also didn&apos;t ask so.... I figured it was a given. I would and will go back but will be more mindful next time."
4,"This place has been on my list to try for YEARS. 
Came in with my cousin and was immediately seated on a Wednesday night. The server brought over the menu&apos;s and we both got the Cajun Black bean burger with a Taco Salad. 

The Black bean burger was okay. Now chicago has steep vegan &amp; vegetarian competition so, Chicago standards its okay. Now to standards in Georgia or Louisiana its good! 

The Taco Salad was my cousin&apos;s and I favorite! We ate it up quickly!

I wanted a milk shake too but, they didn&apos;t have almond milk or soy milk which I was kinda surprised about the lack of non dairy options. Though as that market grows, maybe they&apos;ll have more options by my next visit.
Glad I came! Love the location, people there, and that taco salad!"
3,"I was so excited to come to this place ever since moving back to Chicago. Upon walking in it felt like I was transported to a 1960&apos;s diner with a Johnny Rocket&apos;s type feel. There is pretty limited seating at the Boystown location vs. the Logan Square location so don&apos;t be shocked if there is a wait when you arrive.

For starters, we ordered the Thai Chili wings. They were $10 and you get about 7-8 large &apos;wings&apos; smothered in this delicious, sticky Asian sauce. These were by far my favorite thing we ordered. Although they do not taste, look or have the consistency of chicken wings, they are really good. They look and taste more like a &apos;slab&apos; of meat than anything. 

For an entree, I ordered the black bean burger with a side of brussel sprouts. I opted to get my burger on a lettuce bun rather than bread. When the burger came out it was smothered in this Velveeta-like vegan cheese which I really didn&apos;t care for. The burger itself was pretty flavorless and dry. I actually prefer Morningstar black bean burgers to this one. The brussel sprouts were not my favorite either. They were coated in a balsamic glaze and were very charred but not in a good, crispy way. They were almost burnt on the outside but not fully cooked on the inside. 

All in all, this place is just alright. Everyone in my group agreed the food was okay, but not worth returning to anytime soon. On a positive note, the prices are very reasonable (for a vegan restaurant) and the staff was friendly and accommodating."
5,"The Quick: Vegan &quot;junk food&quot; at its finest. The wings appetizer was incredible and big- definitely share. Diner feel, very casual, beautifully diverse staff, expect a wait at peak times.

The Details: vegan junk food has to be my favorite ! Any meatless bacon, burger, chicken, etc will have my heart. Highly recommend!"
5,"I am obsessed with the Chili at Chicago Diner. It is SOOOO good. I discovered it only about 6 weeks ago.  I have had it for lunch now 6 times!  Super delicious.  The $5 size is a little too small for me for my lunch,  but the $10 size is a little to big for me but I eat it all anyway !  I will try something else for a change one of these days."
5,"An absolute must for all vegetarians visiting the city. 

The selection is huge, with quinoa and great salads for the more health conscious, and then pot pies, the Titanic BLT Burger and even a pierogi quesadilla for me, thanks.

This place is basically an institution at this point, so I sure hope it&apos;s still thriving when I next get to Chicago."
1,"After eating at this diner a few times, I realized that this is not it. 
I&apos;ve tried the Buddha&apos;s karma burger. It needed to be salvaged with condiments. This time around, I got the country fried steak and it was bland and underwhelming. I planned to eat it in the car but instead went home to season it &amp; the vegetables myself. Being a vegan diner, I had higher hopes that they would at least know how to season their vegetables. The flavor is just not there."
4,"Vegetarian spot, which I wasn&apos;t expecting. 

I am a meat eater, and do not like experimenting with &apos;alternative&apos; food products. We sat, and questioned whether we wanted to stay after peering at the menu. The staff was very welcoming, and immediately sat us and brought us water. At this point, I didn&apos;t want to get up and leave. The space is a bit tight, and the room was filled.

Chicken pot pie (chicken seitan used): 4  
Truffle Mushroom Lentil loaf: 4
Avocado crunch salad w/ white beans: 3.5

Service: 5
Place was packed on a Wednesday afternoon."
5,"I can&apos;t rave about this place enough- and this is coming from someone who grew up eating a TON of meat. 
The staff is super sweet, great prices, and food is great quality. 
My girlfriend and I have a pretty consistent order (but the whole menu is great): The Rueben, the Cubano, Buffalo Wings, and the chicken/ranch or Caesar salad. 
20/10 would recommend!"
