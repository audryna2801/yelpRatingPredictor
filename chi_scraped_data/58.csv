5,"Gibson&apos;s on Rush Street is a classic. It&apos;s like an old friend. You know what to expect and are always happy once you visit. 

This time, we sat at a table in the bar. I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect and was very pleased. They took our temperature upon entering. The tables were nicely spread apart and there was plexiglass in between each one. I felt very comfortable. 

We loved everything we ordered. The homemade house vinaigrette is always spot on. The brussel sprouts and mushrooms were sooo tasty. 

Our server was amazing. He saw we were chatting  and checked on us often without interrupting. He was a true professional - personable and on top of his game. 

It felt weird to be there without the usual crowds. I looked around and remembered all the crazy evenings spent squeezed into a bustling bar area. The room looked the same yet different. The empty grand piano was there but Lloyd was not. I could almost here him playing in my mind...

I look forward to visiting again, once this scary pandemic is a bit more controlled."
5,"Came in for a late dinner and was very impressed. Our waitress was great and quite knowledgeable. They also had solid COVID protocols in place as the tables were distanced and our temperatures were taken before entering. 

Started with the house salad with ranch. Vegetables were fresh and the ranch dressing was ok. 

Got the Chicago center cut steak (22 oz) and was very impressed. The steak was cooked perfectly. The taste was amazing and it melted in my mouth. Added blue cheese on top was also quite delicious. The creamed spinach was also amazing. Fresh and good flavor. 

Ended with the carrot cake. As you can see, it was absolutely huge!! The frosting was delicious and the cake was tasty and moist. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great steak in Chicago!"
5,"Gibson&apos;s---


You have my entire heart. Might have been half the reason I moved to Chicago &amp; maybe half the reason I can&apos;t ever leave. 


After about 5 trips here now I can honestly say every time is just as good as the last, if not better.

We came in the winter for my husbands birthday and sat inside of course. The vibe last November was a chill cozy steakhouse. Not too fancy but they do have white table cloths so you can dress up and feel fancy or dress casual if you prefer. 

Since covid and summer has hit- the outdoor patio is HUGE and makes you feel like you&apos;re in Europe. LOVEEEEEE sitting outside here people watching! 

ALWAYS amazing service!! We always have different servers but they&apos;ve all been great! Last one I can remember was Dante and he was super great! 

Food is alwaysssss incredible!!  Filet sliders are my new addiction! UGH the fries are the bestttt ! 

Desserts are HUGEEE and great for sharing (probably 5 people) or taking home. If you&apos;re a dessert person and you&apos;re looking for an after dinner spot, this would be my first choice! Chocolate pie Is sooo silky with a nice cookie crunch base. 

I&apos;ve only ever had the filet here and after trying about every other fancy steakhouse in Chicago &amp; Orlando I can tell you Gibson&apos;s is THE BEST!! 

The sides are all huge and worth the price, you will leave feeling full and completely satisfied! 

LOVE YOU Gibson&apos;s !!"
5,"Napa Valley Silver Oak and a couple burgers! Done son. I&apos;ll never get sick of going to Gibsons. It&apos;s always the jam! Whether you order a ribeye or a fillet, it&apos;s always good there. I noticed some lobster tails come out that were the size of my head. Next on the agenda for sure. It&apos;s been a minute since lobster for me. 

This place is a Gold Coast staple you can&apos;t go wrong. Simple fact I can walk here or Carmine&apos;s or Maple &amp; Ash is the best. I&apos;ll spend my whole paycheck at Gibsons haha I heart food. Service was top notch as usual, capt was great, we talked about the idea of a nice bottle of wine with a solid burger is so good. The vibe is always great at Gibsons. Surprised I&apos;ve never left a review here but nothing but the best experiences there always. Making memories at Gibsons. Thanks to everyone. 

See you soon."
1,"TERRIBLE PHONE COMMUNICATION! Called to order a pickup for Valentine&apos;s Day and the coordination was horrendous. Called the night before to place a order, and they said call and place your order the day of pick up. Called the day of pick up they said call 30 mins before I wanted to pick up. Ok, call the last time and they said they were completely slammed! Ya!!!

Get better people to work the phones, I shouldn&apos;t be scrambling to find dinner if I called the night before. Unbelievable!!"
1,"This review is a combination of having the worst waiter I&apos;ve ever had in a fine dining restaurant + subpar food. We have been to Gibson&apos;s many times and last night will probably be our last. 

Let me start with our server, Montrose, who has some very serious attitude issues. This guy was acting like us paying $300+ for a dinner was a major inconvenience to him. He didn&apos;t even introduce himself when we first sat down but that was just the tip of the iceberg. 

Snide comment after snide comment with this guy. Here&apos;s an example: When we were clearly done with our dinner, nothing on our plate, he comes up and asks if he can take my plate. 
My response: &quot;yep we&apos;re all done&quot;
Waiters snide comment: &quot;I didn&apos;t ask if you were done, I asked if I can take your plate&quot;

Again that was just an example. This guy and his comments and attitude were unacceptable for a fine dining restaurant. 

On top of all of that, the food was almost as bad as the service. I ordered my filet medium and it was served at maybe 100Â°F. 

They of course put it back in for me and cooked it to medium, causing it to lose flavor. Of course our server didn&apos;t feel the need to apologize or anything! 

At the end of it all I still tipped montrose his 20% for inconveniencing him SOO much"
1,"Carry out has gone downhill. The filter sliders now come with a tiny bag of soggy French fries. The Caesar salad has option to add chicken which I did - assuming it&apos;s just grilled chicken, but it was covered in a pesto sauce which I&apos;m allergic to and doesn&apos;t even go with a Caesar salad so got tossed in the trash. Won&apos;t be bothering with supporting this place anymore."
5,"I&apos;ve heard Gibson&apos;s is the spot to eat red-meat for some time now. Until now, I&apos;ve been more of a traditional steak girl (shout out to the OG Gene &amp; Giorgetti). 

We came here on a Thursday night and the weather was divine. Food was delicious and service was wonderful.

I am converted. Check it out if you love meat. VEGANS BEWARE."
3,"My husband and I have been coming here for nearly a decade; we celebrated our one year anniversary together at Gibsons and had a phenomenal experience. However, I feel as if that day set the bar too high for us, as we feel as if service and quality has gone down over the years. Our steaks, while still good, aren&apos;t up to par with some other the other steakhouses we&apos;ve been to in Chicago. Service, while attentive, has been something left to be desired here. I want to continue to love Gibsons, but it may be time to move on. 
Note: these experiences are from over the years, and are not COVID specific."
5,"The food was out of this world good! We ate salmon, a NY strip steak and the petite filet mignon. They were delicious and cooked to perfection. We shared a twice baked potato and the portion was enough for three! Service was impeccable, our every need was attended to efficiently. The carrot cake was divine, enough for 8-10 people, so very yummy! Would recommend for divine food, large potions and friendly, helpful waitstaff."
5,Went here for my 22nd birthday. Very yummy food. The whole staff is super friendly (the waiters) the front staff people were not as friendly and just give weird looks... but that didn&apos;t bother me too much. Will deff be coming here!
5,Best steak ever! Steak is perfect with high-quality. We try Filet and T-Bone for Medium. The flavor is totally out of my imaginations. It tastes still great even overnight. Now I know what&apos;s called &quot;steak.&quot;
5,"Had the best birthday celebration here! Our server Olivia was spectacular and so helpful and nice. The wedge salad was the perfect starter. The Chilean sea bass was delicious and meaty. The Brussels sprouts are a must-have side dish and come with SO much. The espresso martini was strong and the perfect nightcap and end to the meal. They were adhering to COVID guidelines and had heaters and outdoor seating along with indoor seating on the perimeter of the restaurant with the windows/doors open. We were far away from other tables and face masks were worn while interacting with staff and while at your table while not eating or drinking. While you definitely spend a pretty penny at Gibson&apos;s, every cent is worth it because the food and service are both spectacular."
4,"The takeout here during the pandemic has been excellent. Always happy with our order. It&apos;s always packaged thoughtfully and always hot. We would go in person if we could, but love to to support via carry out."
5,"Just getting around to a review of Gibson&apos;s and boy was it wonderful.  Came here pre-covid in town for a concert (don&apos;t we all miss those)?  I digress -- Our server was absolutely on point and stellar with recommendations (me being a first timer to the establishment).  We had the Jumbo Lump Crab cake as appetizer -- I had a Caesar salad and the W.R&apos;s Chicago cut (22 oz) steak.  Sides, had mashed potatoes and Sauteed mushrooms.

Dessert had the Carrot cake (if you can make it that far).


Proceeded to the show super satisfied.  When I get back to Chicago, I certainly will swing by Gibsons again.  I was highly impressed."
5,Amazing food and service.  Loved this place.  They plank fish was out of this world.  The bloody marry may have been the best I have ever tried.  Thank you for a great lunch and amazing service.  I hope to be back next time I visit Chicago.
5,"I&apos;ve been here twice now (once pre COVID, and once recently) and both times, the food and service were fantastic! Currently, they are mostly seating people outside near the heat lamps, and are only seating a limited number of people indoors near open windows, 6 feet apart. Their staff are very professional, friendly and are well rehearsed with the menu. For the two of us, we usually order a wine, large salad, a side, and a steak to share, (since family style is encouraged here), and it is more than enough! Some recommendations I have are the W.R&apos;s Chicago cut 22 ounce steak cooked medium (super tender and delicious), and the spicy lobster Cobb salad. The La Crema wine pairs beautifully with their cuts as well!"
5,We love a good steak house. There is a certain romance to them. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. My ribeye was cooked Perfect and seasoned well. I loved the vibe here and can&apos;t wait to go back!
5,"Great food, but really it is the service. Ask for Elvis. He is an amazing human who just treats you so well. I mean damn. He even wrote out a few other places to try in Chicago. 

But the steaks are amazing, cooked perfectly, the sides huge so you need to share, and the drinks made with care. We will be back."
5,"This place was above and beyond all expectations. We had outdoor seating and the wait staff said they would make use feel like we were in Tampa despite the December weather. They were not kidding. Between four heat lamps I felt like I could have gotten away with short sleeve shirts. 
The waiter was very personable, and knew the menu - both food and drink - inside and out. I had the best cooked lamb chops I could have hoped for, and some of the best Old Fashions I have ever had. I stopped counting after 3 of them...
I also the liked the oysters and cucumber mignonette, which was pretty good. 
If I had one small improvement,  I would have liked some chimichurri sauce for the lamb or steaks."
