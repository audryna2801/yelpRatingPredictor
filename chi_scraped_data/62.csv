5,"Awesome coffee shop. Gives you a 90s feel like you&apos;re stepping back in time! Coffee is really good, I had their vanilla bean latte which was on point! Love where they&apos;re located! The outside of their shop is really cool, have to see it in person."
5,Cool place. Pre covid I used to hang out and read their Calvin and Hobbes on one of their couches. The coffee is tasty as well as their chai. Yum!
5,Their coffee is delicious you won&apos;t be disappointed! I got the iced Koopa Troopa which only comes in a small size. Coffee came out extremely fast and I loved it! They also had a pretty good selection of teas to pick from. It was a bit pricey than average but the taste was definitely worth it. would love to come by again.
4,"First time visiting ever but unfortunately in the middle of a pandemic! I think the experience here would be much more awesome if I was able to stay awhile to enjoy the drink. I got the Ghostly Trio - white miso, caramel and black sesame latte. I got a bit of hint of the miso flavor but not much of the sesame flavor. Either way this was delicious and I&apos;d get it again. It tasted like a sweet and savory latte. 

First timers, do not be afraid to open the door! I saw a lot of people who walked by who were trying to peak in to figure out what exactly the shop was."
4,"This is a great spot, full of nostalgia for a Gen X and Millennial crowd. There is a lot of sci-fi memorabilia on display, as well as some other cool 80s stuff. I will refrain from spoiling too much, I feel that it&apos;s better one just goes there and sees what this place has to offer. There&apos;s unique art on the wall and some cool props, such as a Macintosh SE where one leaves their dishes and silverware. Toward the back there is a NES hooked up to a CRT TV to really drive home the nostalgia. It&apos;s like going through a... well... wormhole and coming out in the late 80s/early 90s. There is WiFi, so one can still stay connected to the present day if they desire. 

The drinks are really good, as are the snacks. I take my coffee black and can be a harsh judge, but the coffee definitely stands up. I feel it important to point out the space and cleanliness of the restroom. I felt very comfortable there. It&apos;s important to call out and appreciate these things. 

I find myself in this part of town, when visiting Chicago, very often and usually take a detour to grab some coffee here."
1,"My last review was deleted because this cafe wants to cover up what they did. They treat Black customers terribly. Screenshot from Instagram. They don&apos;t want to rectify, only cover up."
5,"Stopped in with a fellow remote co-worker for some brew to start the day. The Sci Fi themed interior, displaying a life sized DeLorean and playing Stranger Things inspired beats, was exciting to say the least.

In addition to the decorating, the menu offers some pretty wild latte flavors. 

I really loved this place, however, take note, if you do plan on working from here the music is fairly loud and not the most conducive to a working environment."
4,"We were in the neighborhood for brunch at Machine and promised Leyla we would stop by Wormhole afterwards. I got the cool but rude latte (hot, ginger, curry) with oat milk. It was very good! Love that bite of ginger in my lattes. The girls got hibiscus iced teas. One with lots of sugar, one with medium sugar. Both tasty! Carry out only. 5 people allowed at a time."
5,Great coffee spot in the neighborhood. Very cozy atmosphere there. I have enjoyed my hot brew inside as well as Togo and tastes great every time. The service is kind and pleasant too. I will support this small business over Starbucks any day!!
4,"Love the Honey Bear latte... tastes a lot like Sugar Smacks cereal. Seriously! 

Cool shop, nice staff, and good quality coffee. Interesting decor if you&apos;re an 80s movie buff. 

Recommended!"
4,"After seeing Wormhole make an appearance on several &quot;best coffee in Chicago&quot; lists, I knew I had to try it. It absolutely lived up to the hype- my vanilla latte was DIVINE. I just wish the sizes had been larger (the &quot;large&quot; was 12oz??) and it was the priciest coffee I&apos;ve had yet. My friend emphatically recommends the PB koopa troopa and said it was, quote, &quot;the best coffee I&apos;ve ever had&quot;."
3,"Place is super cute - back to the future decor with a decent amount of seating (as long as you don&apos;t mind sitting at a table with strangers - which I don&apos;t). 
I got a regular latte (because I am a boring slice of white bread) that took about 15 minutes to get. The latte itself was decent - your standard latte, I imagine if I got something more flavorful I would have a different reaction. Staff was friendly , wifi was fast. 
Hard to study - they were blaring some sort of dance music."
4,"Shows you how much I get around.  The Wormhole Coffee has been here for 9 1/2 years.  I went here on Saturday 10/12/19 w/my sis &amp; cousins daughter after stopping at Stan&apos;s Donuts for the first time.  

I was already wired from eating a double chocolate donut and I decided to get a peanut butter chocolate coffee.  Yeaaa good choice as if I wasn&apos;t already wired from the donut the coffee put me on a different level.  It was delicious, but way toooo much sugar fo dis boy.  

The Wormhole Coffee is a cool little shop that is themed after movies w/posters all around the coffee shop of different movies &amp; different Paraphernalia from various movies.  In the back they have a Delorean sitting up on a ledge.  I will probably be back again, but no donut before."
4,"Cool coffee shop in wicker park. They definitely had some interesting menu options but I was not gutsy enough to try it! 

I just ordered a vanilla latte. The flavors were really good and the place itself had a lot of fun decor. As long as my espresso is strong I&apos;m not complaining! 

Definitely a cool coffee shop to check out if you are in the area."
5,"How have I never reviewed you my friend? 

The first time I came here 4 years ago there was no wait because I got here super early.

This time it took a long while to get my order. The order was great, but the wait shouldn&apos;t take that long.

5 stars for decor, vibe and intent though."
4,"Definitely Portland-type coffee shop vibe! Lots of unique decorations! 

Tried the koopa-troopa, gotta say it&apos;s definitely interesting. I wish I could taste the chocolate a bit more cause the peanut butter over powers latte in my opinion, but still a good experience. Only thing is not sure, I&apos;d pay $5.25 again for an 8oz."
5,"This is the BEST place to get coffee in all of Chicago (in my opinion, of course)!! My boyfriend and I researched the best coffee places in the city and stumbled upon this coffee shop. The person taking our order was so so kind and truly genuine. I ended up ordering a plain old americano (I know, I&apos;m boring) and my boyfriend ordered a cold brew. My americano was really good but the cold brew was absolutely amazing. 

There is definitely a &quot;nostalgic&quot; vibe inside of this coffee shop. They have vintage everything, which I&apos;m not usually all that into but I really did think this place was cool. 

After my boyfriend and I enjoyed our drinks, we went back to the counter to buy some beans. The barista helped us pick out the Halfwit &quot;triforce blend.&quot; I&apos;m not joking when I say this is by far the best coffee I&apos;ve had in a long time--I recently traveled to Costa Rica and enjoyed some of their finest coffee so this is definitely a statement. I usually prefer my coffee hot but I&apos;ve been pouring this blend over ice and it&apos;s 10x better.

I cannot recommend Wormhole enough!"
3,"I like this place for regular coffee. But went in last week asking or espresso beans and the baristas had no idea that espresso beans are different than regular beans. It&apos;s a thing, girls. Look it up. Yeesh."
5,"There will always be a special place in my heart for the wormhole. I&apos;ve been coming to this shop for the past 3 years and it has continued to serve me well. The baristas are friendly and the overall vibe is very down-to-earth.

Drinks: I enjoy the special lattes that they have to offer. My favorites are the koopa troopa which is a chocolate peanut butter latte and the honey bear (honey latte). The baristas do an excellent job with the latte art! 

The lighting is on the darker side so if you need bright light to stay focused, then this isn&apos;t the place for you to get work done. There are a good amount of tables and couches with outlets nearby. Just be wary that this place can get crowded on the weekends, but for a good reason! The summer hours are from 7am-9pm so you could camp at wormhole with ample food options on milwaukee.

Parking: street parking is available for a fee but is free on sundays!"
5,"This is one of the coolest coffee shops in the city.  First the coffee is awesome.  They do the basics very well, and have a wide verity of interesting and creative coffee and tea drinks.  The staff is not only friendly, but I often find myself chatting with them about coffee.  The best part is the decor and the theme.  It is mostly 1980s and 1990s pop culture and sci fi.  They have tons of funko pops and movie posters, but the highlight is the full, live-size DeLorean from Back to the Future.  The coffee shop also features a vintage TV with a fully functioning NES with tons of games.  One word of caution, it does get busy.  Overall, a great coffee shop."
