5,"One of my Chicago Bucket Lists: 

Eat warm pancakes in front of the gorgeous tall buildings while freezing myself to a point where I can&apos;t move my bum anymore! 

Well, this place was perfect for that, I was taken aback by their berry pancakes...it was so damn delicious, I&apos;m still drooling thinking about it. 
My friend ordered the corned beef hash skillet and I got the Benedict... we enjoyed both the dishes equally! 
When I go back to Chicago next time, this place will definitely be on my list. 

Parking: plenty of street parking available- I paid $9 for 2.5 hours 

Dine in: they still haven&apos;t started dining in as per the state rules, but you can definitely try the outdoor seating. It definitely is cold but they&apos;re also prepared for that. It was below freezing when I went but I didn&apos;t feel as bad as I should have because the heating torches are great. 

Servers: very understanding and helpful! Their suggestions were pretty great too!"
5,"They Practice social distancing! Food &amp; coffee came out fast...hot...good. Austyn is an excellent server. Came again today, forgot to check in, but he was still great. Long as he works here, I&apos;ll keep coming back. Management should give him accolades."
5,"This was probably one of the better meals that I&apos;ve had at Wildberry pancakes. Because of Covid, I opted to eat outside on Pearson Street. It was a little windy but I was able to make it work. One of my favorite items is the omelette with caramelized onion, goat cheese and spinach. I don&apos;t know why but the flavors just complement each other. I also went basic white girl and had a pumpkin apple latte special that they had. I was also able to also upgrade to the special pancake and had the pumpkin ones as well. The female server was super nice and friendly, and checked on me as I dined alone. 

Obviously from the photos, the portions are very generous, and I actually took half of the meal back to my hotel. You could definitely share an omelette between two people. I dined probably around 8:30 AM on a Sunday and was able to be seated right away. I would definitely return and recommend to others."
5,"I love going to this place every time I&apos;m visiting Illinois. I personally enjoy breakfast and this place is just perfect for that. Highly recommend it. The wait time can vary but the most we&apos;ve waited is 45 minutes and the least  has been 15 minutes. 

Food is quickly served and the staff is very friendly. 

Recommended!"
4,"This place was wicked fast. There was quite a wait but thankfully they use waitlist so we signed up and walked over. They were ready for us when we arrived. 

Ok back to being wicked fast. We ordered two entrees and a side dish. Everything came out immediately and we legit were done eating after being there for 20 minutes. 

The portions were huge and the food was really good - especially the biscuit and gravy. Would definitely come back!"
5,"Everything was amazing. So much food and so delicious. I do recommend if you&apos;re going with a significant other please order something to share! It&apos;s so much food! I got the mexicana skillet with two specialty pancakes the wildberry one. It was so good! It was so much we had to take some back to the hotel. Everything about this was amazing, the service was awesome as well."
5,"Rating: 5.0 Stars

Thank God I checked in on Yelp. As a major pancake lover, I inevitably had to go here because they offer my favorite food: Cinnamon Roll Pancakes. Ergo, I ordered the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes. First off, the portion size is insane. You get 5 specialty pancakes for $11. The flavor was out of this world. The cream cheese frosting and cinnamon sugar glaze complemented each other so nicely. No syrup needed! These are easily the third best cinnamon roll pancakes that I have ever had in my entire life. Despite the size, I finished the plate in under 5 minutes. Oops. Well done and highly recommended. Next time that I am in Chicago, I will be back! My only &quot;complaint&quot; is that I was sitting outside on a very nice day so I wasn&apos;t able to capture a better photo of this amazing meal."
5,This place is a must when in Chicago!!! Great food and good customer service. One downside with this whole COVID was we had to dine outside in the cold. Other than that I have NO complaints about this place. Definitely will come visit again when in the area.
5,We happened upon this location while doing some shopping downtown and they were able to accommodate us right on the spot! Indoor dining was open and the atmosphere was nice. I got the mushroom and prosciutto omelette with hash browns and the berry bliss pancakes while my sister got the eggs Benedict. Everything was great! The omelet was cooked to perfection with wonderful tasting cheese inside and fresh mushrooms. The prosciutto added a nice salty taste as well. The pancakes were my absolute favorite though. The berry syrup was amazing and the berry mascarpone was to die for and absolutely made the whole dish. The hasbrowns were pretty typical and the eggs Benedict was okay. I found the ham on the eggs Benedict to be much too thick and tough as well as the bread. But the hollandaise sauce was good and helped with the flavor. The service was great and they followed all COVID regulations.
5,"One of my favorite brunch places to take family and friends to whenever they visit Chicago! Normally, the wait time is at least 30 minutes, but with recent social distancing measures in place, there are fewer tables available and we ended up waiting 1.5 hours for a table. I will say they are doing a great job keeping tables separated and all of their employees are masked up! We ordered the mexicana skillet and upgraded the pancakes to their signature berry bliss pancakes (HIGHLY recommend), along with a side of corned beef hash. Delicious all around and portions are sizable, especially for the price! I have yet to order something I don&apos;t like from their menu!"
3,"Give it a try if the line&apos;s not too long...
Came here for our goodbye Chicago breakfast. It was cold out so we started with the cinnamon spice and honey toffee lattes which, with their understated flavors, really hit the spot. Good job barista&apos;s!
Maya got the banana pancakes and I got the corned beef eggs Benedict. The flavor of the pancakes was there, but we both agreed they were too dry, and I found the chipotle hollandaise and corned beef to be competing vice complementary flavors, though the dish was well executed. 
Should&apos;ve had something with berries!"
5,"Hands down the best breakfast/ Brunch spot I have ever had the pleasure of devouring. We were starving after traveling from Florida and could&apos;nt have been more pleased with our first Chicago meal. 

We were seated immediately. Our server Eustis was fantastic. He brought us a high chair and offered my son a magnetic doodle board which he loved. Our server suggested the best items to order and within minutes of placing our order...huge, gorgeous, tasty plates came out. Quick/excellent service is a understatement. 

With each bite came ohhhss and ahhs of pure bliss. I got the Slow Roast Brisket Hash. It also came with pancakes which I upgraded to cinnamon bun flavor. It was a large portion but I couldn&apos;t stop. My boyfriend got the vegan hash. He said the veggie patty was amazing. Lastly my friend got the Los Altos Benedict. Again amazing!! Overall delicious food, A+ Service despite it being their last hour open. We would come every week if we had one in Florida."
5,"I can honestly say they have the BEST PANCAKES EVER. The orange juice was amazing as well because it tasted like pure squeezed orange. We shares these plates and they served so much food that we took some to go. 
SIMPLY AMAZING. FULLY RECOMEND"
4,"Great food - bit of a wait, and packed during non-Covid times during football season, but enjoyed everything I had!"
4,"Had breakfast here one morning. They just released their new fall menu so I got the pumpkin spice pancakes. Yum!! Huge portions of fluffy pancakes that tasted so good. My boyfriend got the banana pecan cream waffle and it was so delicious as well. Great service, will definitely be back!"
4,"Unfortunately, the Waitlist service on Yelp is only for party&apos;s of 4 or less. Our party of 6 had to go to the location to be added to the group, waited about 45 minutes. We didn&apos;t mind as the weather was beautiful and there is a walk up cafe bar inside so we got an early start on our latte drinks.

I&apos;ve been to Wildberry numerous times and it is a must go when friends/family are visiting from out of town. There is something for everyone and the service is awesome. 

My go to meal is a the Mexicana Skillet with the Wildberry Berry Bliss pancakes as a side! Never complained and never switched up my order! The only thing is I wish their hash browns were more crispy.

Again, the good and service is great. I do not go often due to long wait times on a regular basis, but wait is definitely worth the wait!"
3,"First things first, the portions aren&apos;t great for what we&apos;re paying. I got a fruit cup as a side and had 5 pieces of fruit. They put two blueberries in it. Then I didn&apos;t want to tip because I was going to pick up the food myself but they somehow added a tip. Next what I really liked was the rye bread! It&apos;s out of this world. One of the only things that wowed me from this place."
5,"This is such a great location! I&apos;ve been to most of their locations, and this one is another great spot. I love being able to grab a delicious brunch and then go shopping on Michigan after. My go to at all of their spots is still the Mexicana skillet without meat and a side of the signature berry bliss pancakes. They have 2 floors of seating which helps to feel more comfortable and less cramped, and the second floor is really cute. Looking forward to going back once indoor dining starts up again!"
4,"We walked in around 2 PM not knowing that the restaurant closes at 2:30 PM, so I was impressed that they still sat us down. In fact, they were still seating people after us.

Our server introduced herself and quickly took our order; they have an extensive menu of pancakes and other brunch items. We saw almost every other table with an order of pancakes, and as yummy, as it looked, we wanted something heartier, so we opted for a grilled cheese with brisket and turkey panini with jack cheese. Funny enough, the server mistook my order for a cranberry turkey sandwich. It was so good, I only noticed halfway through! lol This comes with a hefty portion of fries or sweet potato fries. You def will leave here feeling full."
3,"Honestly I don&apos;t understand those 5 stars reviews at all.
Huge place dinner style, not tasty food and pretty high prices for this quality of the food. 
Service was good and the pancakes were ok but I definitely never go there again."
