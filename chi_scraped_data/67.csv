5,"I ordered RPM steak to go about a month ago and I have to say for a to-go steak house everything was surprisingly phenomenal. The food was still warm by the time I made it home. BUT this past weekend I finally made it there to eat in person. My friend and I made patio reservations- it was so nicely put together but it was cold so I do recommend wearing warm shoes and a coat). When we arrived we were socially distanced checked in and had our temperatures taken and then escorted outside. 

We got settled in and pulled up the QR menu on our phones. 
Food: 
we got half dozen oysters ( they were so good we got a second order)
coal roasted king crab- I am drooling thinking about this. I would probably would want to order 10 just for myself and eat it as an entree. 
16 oz rare NY strip- they cut it for me and my friend since we were sharing and it was so good- took left overs home and reheated so nicely the next day. 
spicy broccolini- this is just perfection for a vegetable. it is honestly the best broccolini I have had at a restaurant ( i ordered it to go and had it in the restaurant) 

Overall I thought the food was great but by that point in the evening we were  so cold we asked if we could move inside with our waiter since indoor dining opened up and management staff was so friendly and were able to accommodate our request. We continued our evening with a Baked Alaska dessert  (delicious) and some more cocktails 

for drinks we had the spritz and giggles, prosecco, espresso martini and we asked our waiter for the bartender to make us a vodka based shot- no idea what it was but it was great!

Over all- superb service, delicious food and cocktails, the inside of the restaurant was nicely socially distanced and there was no point where I felt uncomfortable. 

I would recommend for sure!"
5,"I lowkey wanted to not like this place to not add another &quot;fancy and expensive&quot; restaurant to my list of must try restaurants, but ughh! I&apos;m still dreaming about that thick cut bacon!

So here&apos;s the deal, I didn&apos;t have the steak lol I did have the truffle burger though, and man! I was nervous about the foie gras butter, but it was probably the best addition to the burger! It made it buttery and delicious, and the meat was tender and wonderful. The bun was buttery and soft too, not soggy at all.

But my takeaway from what we tried, that bacon! It melts in your mouth, so tender, sweet and out of this world. I want to go back and have 3 servings of this alone! Drinks were nice to look at and even nicer to drink. Service as expected was wonderful. 

On brand, RPM did not disappoint."
5,"This place is a must go! We came during the pandemic so it wasn&apos;t busy. The restaurant was nice and clean. Our server was knowledgeable and he recommended the black truffle risotto. When I say he recommended it, he really really pushed us to get it. I was debating between the Mac and cheese and risotto and our server told us to get the risotto and we wouldn&apos;t regret it....and he was right! Omg it was amazing! Best risotto we had ever had! Loved the truffle! The cowboy steak delicious! Perfectly cooked and super flavorful. The seasoning was great. It was crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. My boyfriend got the reserve steak which is a wagu A5 strip and it was phenomenal. It literally tastes like you are eating a piece of fat because it was so marbled. Definitely a must try if you get a chance. The millionaire potato was amazing. It was basically a twice baked potato which I love. To drink I got a spritz and giggle which I recommend. It&apos;s like a fruity champagne mix. My boyfriend got an old fashion, which he said was great. The ice cube had &quot;RPM&quot; engraved in it. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place. On our trip we also went to Gibson Italia and tried there wagu steak and famous risotto there...it did not compare. RPM is soooo much better! It is an expensive restaurant but I promise you will not regret."
5,"Me my Gf  abs kids decided to come grab an earlier dinner. Called to inquire if they have a dress code abs explained I Was in a t-shirt and jeans and was told business casual/ nothing offensive etc. We parked in parking garage next door. upon arriving we were nicely greeted and checked inside our stroller and seated. Our server Max was awesome laid back and knowledgeable of all menus item and I&apos;ve got to say ha e some great recommendations. My Gf had Andrew Murray Syrah wine  while o dove into a sweet Moscato both were equally tasty. For starters we ordered the Steak Tartare w toasted bread was very good, we did have to order more toasted bread. 
I ordered the 24oz Cowboy Ribeye cooked medium and omg was it perfect  
My Gf ordered a 12 oz bone  in Filet which I thought was good but for me I would&apos;ve ordered a warm butter on the side to drizzle. For side items we ordered spicy  broccolini which was eh nothing special and definitely not spicy
On other hand the japanese sweet potatoes are a must order sweet tasty side item that&apos;s so yummy melting in mouth.
We ordered a mushroom Mac and cheese for kids , fries abs a Truffle burger that was awesome aswell 
Omg I almost forgot the whipped mashed potatoes hmm so yummy  and to fish off our meal 
Why not some desert 
Yes we ordered the blueberry  cheesecake and although I&apos;m not that into blueberries this was amazing you have to order it.

Overall we had a great experience at RPM STEAK and will definitely come back. 

Again still don&apos;t have all the pictures down to a science and almost forgot to take them. Will update pictures on next visit

Thank you for taking the time to read my review"
4,"RPM Steak is actually one of my fave steakhouses in Chicago. I&apos;ve tried their ribeye, steak frites, cowboy, and the Imperial reserve and they&apos;re all very good. Their 14k chocolate cake is so good, just a really perfect chocolate cake. It used to be rectangular but it is now circular with pandemic related standardization but I think I actually prefer it circular (easier to share).

The &quot;outdoor&quot; setup is a high quality tent on the sidewalk. The tables still have tablecloths and they&apos;ve managed to install lighting so it actually feels nicer than just eating outside. It&apos;s warmer than the typical white tents, but not sure there&apos;s any air circulation since it seems to be completely enclosed. There&apos;s no heat lamps since it&apos;s probably a fire hazard in this type of set up. The tables are a bit closer together than I prefer. It kinda feels like you&apos;re inside, which is both good and bad, but it&apos;s still cold. The thick tent blocks the wind, but my feet were frozen by the end of the meal. Its definitely a whole thing trying to eat out and support restaurants during these times.

Prior to the pandemic, I really enjoyed eating inside the restaurant. It&apos;s dark and moody, a perfect steakhouse vibe. Can&apos;t wait for everything to be &quot;normal&quot; again."
4,"A nice lunch at RPM Steak for thanksgiving! They offer Thanksgiving menu@ $95 per person. Very good deal to taste everything and also being thankful for what we are still able to do. 

The patio is not as cold as we thought, but make sure to prepare enough cloth.

What surprised us is their Aged Parmesan Risotto.  With the lightly touched Hazelnut, this dish makes you feel fresh and warm and elegant. It&apos;s perfect fit into their Thanksgiving menu.

The Butternut Squash Bisque is very delicious, taste very flavorful with good sweetness in it. 

The King Crab looks beautiful. The sweet and salt is well balanced. The cheese is a bit strong and I think it&apos;s good for a small portion dish just like this. 

14k chocolate cake is luxurious, the taste is good but just like average cake. 

We had a great experience. Maybe it is their Thanksgiving menu, I would expect more surprise next time."
5,I ate at the bar for a quick steak paired with a glass of champagne. Little did I know that Dion would absolutely spoil me with a luxurious champagne and a complimentary taste of an A5 Japanese wagyu tartar. What a treat!!
5,"I always recommend this place to people because it has never disappointed. The stake is always cooked to perfection, so much flavor in every single bite. As for the lobster, amazing. Ironically RPM Steak is where I had lobster for the first time. The spicy miso gives it so much flavor. I recommend going for the whole if that is going to be your main dish because before you know it, it will be all gone! The servers are always so attentive and the most professional as well."
2,"Considering how much fancy steakhouses like RPM want to charge you for their gourmet food, they should be graded harsher than most other restaurants. I decided 2 stars as opposed to 1 star because the service was excellent and the food was cooked properly. The staff was on top of checking our tables and the food came quickly.

Cowboy steak was medium rare as requested and the miso lobster wasn&apos;t rubbery. I really liked the mushroom&apos;s flavor. However, the flavors of the main courses, lobster and steak, were simply underwhelming. Nothing stood out from the steak by itself. This was my first dry aged prime steak and I just wasn&apos;t wowed by neither flavor nor tenderness. The side seasoning was crazy salty (I promise I wasn&apos;t coating my steak pieces in it). Presentation of the lobster was meh and so was the miso sauce. I would describe it as ham butter?"
2,"Their truffle burger used to be one of my favorite burgers in the city. It&apos;s not shown on their current menu but is available during dinner. They used to only serve it during lunch.

Likes
- Service for pickup was good
- COVID protocols

Dislikes
- Patty was overcooked and densely packed such that it was tough. Tasted like bad quality frozen patties. I asked for medium rare and it was more like medium well
- Burger bun is different than in the past and had a harder top crust.
- Fries size/type changed. They used to be super thin and crispy, now they are normal fries and are mushy. I didn&apos;t taste any Parmesan but noticed green herbs still
- Not worth $21 pre-tax

I&apos;m really sad that things changed after COVID.  I&apos;ll never order the burger here again. I&apos;d rather spend $21+ on some sushi."
4,"This review is for the pick-up service only. Unfortunately, my milestone birthday was during the pandemic, which definitely limited/canceled any plans I had in place originally. I figured at the very least, I should treat myself to a decadent dinner. By decadent, I meant wagyu beef!

Go figure,  but wagyu beef was actually very difficult to find for pick-up in Chicago! Thank God RPM Steak was there to save the day.  My dream was to have the A5 wagyu and truffle risotto that I had been hearing so much about. Unfortunately, neither of these options were available for pick-up. Instead, we ordered the wagyu bone-in NY strip and half spicy miso lobster. To accompany the steak, we also ordered truffle butter. For appetizers, we got the bacon and gruyere popovers and for sides, we got the broccolini and the millionaire&apos;s potatoes.

The breakdown:
- For not being busy, I am not sure why it took 15+ minutes for the food to be ready considering we ordered it a couple days in advance for a 6 pm pick-up. 
- Surprisingly the food traveled well from River North to Lincoln Square! We did turn on the seat warmer.
- Both the steak and lobster were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The steak was epically tender and the truffle butter added an extra oomph. The lobster was also cooked perfectly and I could drink that spicy miso sauce.
- The bacon has a good flavor but was a bit more tough than I expected.
- The popover was fluffy, light and delicious. However, I didn&apos;t really get the gruyere.
- The millionaire&apos;s potato was creamy, cheesy, and truffle-y. Basically the definition of decadent. 

Thank you RPM for the overall amazing birthday dinner!"
1,"This by is one of my favorite steak restaurants in the city of Chicago. The reason I&apos;m giving it such a low rating is they have changed their reservations. You have to go online and pay $50 to make your reservations which will be a credit towards your dinner when you arrive. Which did not happen. Total nonsense then you also have a 5% surcharge which tonight was $30 a bullshit Covid fee on a $700+ dinner which they should be completely embarrassed about and I never got credit on my dinner of the $50 until I asked where is it and they claimed they never charged me. 
I will not be returning anytime soon. The city of Chicago has many many great steakhouses to choose from that don&apos;t play these games like lettuce entertain you does."
2,"RPM Steak and RPM Italia simply can&apos;t justify their prices for the dishes they turn out. When paying premium prices I expect near perfection. This is a place where people pay for the vibe and experience rather than outstanding plates. Not a Top 5 steakhouse in Chicago. .. quite possibly not Top 10. Don&apos;t believe the hype. Price gouging pays for the decor and premium location, not a delicious meal."
4,"Steak was a bit burnt but tasted really good.
14K chocolate cake was delicious,not too sweet.coffee was fresh brewed"
5,"I can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t reviewed RPM steak yet. I will say out of every steakhouse I&apos;ve been to in Chicago it is the very best. I&apos;m trying to get in there tonight to celebrate a birthday and so hopefully this helps. My dear friend Will and his wife Stef first introduced me to RPM many years ago. Double dates and dinners later, it&apos;s always been 100. The 60 day dry age bone-in ribeye, snow beef, crab appetizer and lobster everything, oh and martinis, will literally blow your freakin&apos; mind. The 5 star food and service is represented every single time. Zero complaints. Thanks to the staff for excellence. Thanks to Will &amp; Stef for the 100 pt wines you always bring, and for the insane memories we always make. Love you guys. PS. To the staff at RPM; I need 8 pm on the patio tonight! Please! 

Kindly,
Brian 

PS. Didn&apos;t disappoint! Thank you"
4,"the food was fantastic, but apparently no toy comes with any of the meals? I would have liked a skylander or beyblade. just something to consider if you want a returning customer."
1,Why were all the negative reviews related to the problems experienced on Valentine&apos;s Day removed? Not right. Restaurant does not honor reservations even with a $200 deposit. Charged higher prices than reflected on the menu too.
2,"Not worth the hype at all.

We had amazing service by Eric!

For starters... no  free bread with a steak meal...? You have to pay for your bread here. The Parker house rolls are amazing and may have been my favorite part of the meal! I guess you could say they are worth the 
$6.

We got the &quot;sweet potatoes&quot; , fries, Brussel sprouts and split the 10 oz filet.

Brussels are my favorite sides... these were the actual worst. Extremely greasy, no bacon and they didn&apos;t seem to have any actual insides. It was just the outside leaves of the Brussels. Like the Brussels had been shaved. 

The sweet potatoes are amazing, but not actually sweet potatoes. This should probably be specified on the menu. Their actual white potatoes with a honey, maple Siracha like glaze. Very good!

The fries were good, but kinda cold and lacking flavor for a steakhouse. 

Filet was crunchy on the outside, my favvvvv... but our &quot;medium&quot; was very rare in the middle and I couldn&apos;t eat it. Also didn&apos;t have much flavor, I had to add salt. 

We got the famous 14k chocolate cake and asked for two scoops of ice cream. Be prepared two scoops of ice cream is $6. The chocolate cake was extremely rich but not very sweet. After being so excited to try it I was very disappointed and wish we would  have got the baked Alaska.

The restaurant is dimly lit but not much decor, kinda boring.

I don&apos;t think we would ever return here. I&apos;ve had  wayyyy better meals at Gibson&apos;s, steak 954, ocean prime, trulucks, Eddie Vs, etc. All cheaper, better tasting and include bread also."
4,"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time for his birthday over the weekend. I called in a week in advance to make a reservation and the only available time was after 9:30PM which was pretty shocking. It was a late dinner on a Saturday night. When we got there for our reservation time, they said they didn&apos;t have us down. Another person joined to help. They ended up finding our reservation through my first name because someone put down &quot;Jen&quot; instead of &quot;Kim&quot; for my last name...like c&apos;mon. 

We ended up being seated. Service was impeccable. We were recommended some dishes. Initially, I went in with a mindset of ordering two steaks but we were told to share. We ended up ordering spritz &amp; giggles and Tokyo tea time for our drinks. Spritz &amp; giggles was SO TASTY. My bf got the Tokyo tea time which was pretty much a shot of really strong alcohol. He loved how smooth it was but it was REALLY strong. He really enjoyed my drink too. For food, we ordered the thick-cut bacon, chilled oysters, cowboy steak, and black truffle risotto. Everything was spot on. For our steak doneness, we asked for a medium but got a medium-rare. My bf loved it but I can&apos;t do too bloody. The flavor was great though! 

For dessert, we got a free cotton candy because it was his bday. And we also ordered this banana ice cream covered in Nutella chocolate and hazelnut?? Idk what it was called but the flavor was so unique and rich. We didn&apos;t think we ordered that much but we were both surprisingly stuffed after our meal. 

One downside was how chilly it was inside. Nobody is a big fan of sitting in a drafty restaurant during cold winter-the gusts of wind that you feel whenever people open the door is the worst when you&apos;re trying to enjoy a nice meal  that is all. 

But overall, great experience!"
5,"We had quite a fabulous dinner here.  It was a celebration of sorts and despite the price, it was really worth it.  What wonderful atmosphere and ambiance.  Superior service attitude, delicious food, extraordinary drinks.  Everything was prepared to perfection for us.  The steaks were outstanding, as were the crab legs, waghu beef, lobster and chicken.  Even the salad was scrumptious.  This restaurant is a class act."
