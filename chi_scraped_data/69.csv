5,"Happy to visit them on Saturdays or Sundays for takeout. They do remember me and are also real sweet to my 4-legged Pomsky son, giving him a treat.

Everything delicious. 

Staff a delight.

I&apos;m sad they will eventually be closing their bucktown location...no idea why. They always seemed to be full."
5,"Only have had the pleasure of eating inside once, but it was an incredible experience. I got the mexican hot chocolate and some homemade marshmallows, which were all out of this world. Hot chocolate is one of my favorite desserts and Mindy has somehow taken it and elevated it to an insanely rich, chocolatey and flavorful level. So many different variations to chose from too! After working in the Loop, I found myself taking my lunch break to sneak into the bakery location at Revival just to sneak some of her cookies and hot chocolate. Mindy and her various bakery locations are Chicago staples and I can&apos;t wait until quarantine is over, so I can resume my mission of tasting every one of creations."
5,"Nice pastries and cakes! After having a hard week it&apos;s would be wonderful to treat yourself with such delicacies from Mindy&apos;s. It&apos;s a little sad that the place works only on weekends but on the other hand this circumstance still keeps me in good shape! 

My favorites are lemon and peach muffins! Lemon curd, light sponge with delicate condensed milk based filling and fruit slices is  a miracle! All the pastries look very appetizing! Warning: it&apos;s hard to resist such goodies)"
5,"The Best 
There are no better baking goods in chi town ! There&apos;s no need to say one more word - just go there !"
5,"One of my favorite spots in Chicago! Food, drink, atmosphere and homemade marshmallows! Yum!"
5,"Oddly enough I first tried this place when my younger sister was visiting she worked in fine dining at Walt Disney World and got to work with Mindy Segal at the food and wine festival - we were not disappointed!

Even if you are not a sweets fan, you should give it a try since she has a wide variety on the menu and it&apos;s not just chocolate - it&apos;s sublime as only an award winning chef can create."
4,"We were in the wicker park area, so we decided to stop in for a bit and maybe some coffee.

As soon as we walked in, the restaurant seemed a lot more sophisticated and trendy than we had expected. The walls were visually stimulating, with interesting paintings, sculptures, etc. The longer you look, the more you see. 

I tried the breakfast sandwich ($14) and my guest had a latte. The breakfast sandwich was definitely something special; the bacon jam was alluring and tasty without being overpowering and the breakfast potatoes were perfectly cooked. In a perfect world I wouldn&apos;t pay $14 + tax for a breakfast sandwich, but given the area it was to be expected. My guest really enjoyed their latter, and they even made a cute little heart shape. 

I wish the restaurant had more breathing room, as we didn&apos;t mind eating at the bar, but it was quite crowded overall. Also, I wanted to try the hot chocolate but I couldn&apos;t justify paying $8 for a cup of hot chocolate.

Overall, a cute and trendy restaurant with a great menu selection and drink options, although a bit pricey. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a cozy and relaxing couch-type coffee place. It&apos;s more of a fast-paced and bustling restaurant."
5,"Remember when you would go to Walmart and grab some prepackaged hot chocolate and microwave it with some water and call it a day? Yeah, those memories can be filed deep down in the recesses of your mind because hot chocolate from this place is hands down the most delicious and exquisite thing I have ever had. 

Mind you if you don&apos;t like chocolate or are allergic to it, you have tons of coffee and tea options available! However, to go to a place literally including Hot Chocolate in the name demands you try it. There are several varieties but you all know you gotta go with the Dark Oat. It was earthy with just a hint of sweetness. It&apos;s made with dark chocolate but it wasn&apos;t bitter at all. Also, this place makes their own marshmallows and dear goodness me, I wish I could have bought a pound of those tasty sweet delights! 

The food here all smelled and looked amazing! I had the pancake which you need to wait about half an hour for and every minute was worth the wait. I was served a caramelized souffle pancake. I wish I could eat that as my breakfast every day! 

I recommend that anyone looking to do brunch get a reservation! This place gets packed super quick and the wait lines can be rough!"
3,"This has been on my &quot;must visit&quot; for awhile now.  As we were up in Chicago for the wkd I finally was able to visit for Sunday Brunch.

I must say I was quiet disappointed in the Hot Chocolate.  Was it good? Yes.  The marshmallows were amazing.  Was it worth $8.50????  Definitely not!!!!!!! When u specialize in Hot Chocolate I was expecting something amazing, including a great presentation.  The hot chocolate was served in a small coffee mug.  This was so wrong!  I wanted a big ole mug!!!!  Got much better Hot Chocolate at Eataly the day before."
5,"This is hands down a must for brunch. My husband and I came in on our anniversary and we will forever come back again and again. This is also a fun place to bring a group of girlfriends. The restaurant is adorable. The blueberry cheese danish/pastry was to die for. Their sipping chocolate with homemade marshmallows is also something to be desired or dreamt about, take your pick."
4,"If you had asked me before my latest Sunday Brunch stop if I liked hot chocolate, I would have said &quot;no&quot; and involuntarily gagged as I thought about drinking watery Swiss miss with pathetic freeze dried marshmallows. After a visit to Mindy&apos;s, I have been converted. 

I came here with a large group for brunch on a beautiful, sunny, morning-after-drinking Sunday. We had reservations and were seated in the back of the eclectic, industrial restaurant promptly. 

I ordered the old fashioned hot chocolate. You have to order hot chocolate here. It&apos;s in the name and is therefore the law that you must drink it in this building. My expectations were not high...this shattered everything I knew about hot chocolate. Have you ever had an entire bar of high-quality chocolate melted into a cup full of heavy cream? Because I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s what this was, and it was better than I ever thought possible. 

For brunch, I ordered the mushroom scramble because I love mushrooms and eggs and breakfast potatoes and this plate had all 3. It was great, but nothing revolutionary. I&apos;d get something else next time I go, but I wasn&apos;t disappointed by this by any means. 

My one regret was eating too much to order dessert. Is dessert for brunch a normal thing? I&apos;m not sure, but if there&apos;s a place to do it, it would be at the restaurant of a renowned pastry chef. I feel dumb for not having done this. 

My ONLY complaint is that the service was slow. It took 45 minutes to get our food ordered. Luckily, we had our hot chocolates to keep our blood sugars spiked."
5,"Looking for a quick brunch on a Saturday, a group of friends and I sat at the bar and ordered mimosas. I had the burger, which was delicious, and my husband had the salmon bagel, which was an everything bagel with cream cheese, lox, thinly sliced cucumber, and red onion. Great brunch! It was the middle of summertime so we didn&apos;t order hot chocolate, but we will certainly be back to try some before the end of the winter. *Note: the bagel pictured was my husband&apos;s (I am allergic to fish)."
5,"This is the place you go for a cheat day from your diet. Mindy&apos;s Hot Chocolate is the the epitome of comfort food restaurant dining. PLUS the best hot chocolate and desserts you can find in Chicago. Yes, the hot chocolate is expensive. But it&apos;s worth it. Keep in mind, you are treating yourself. This is not your daily dose of hot chocolate - if that&apos;s your thing.

It looks like the dinner menu has changed a little since the last time I dined here. I see healthy food options and lighter menu items. It&apos;s nice to see a more diverse menu. However, I would stick to the greasy and savory.

Some highlights in terms of food:
- Mac and cheese: there&apos;s a reason it&apos;s (or was) on the top of the menu. If you like your Mac N Cheese creamy like Kraft, this is definitely your new favorite.
- Fried chicken: Delicious. Skin isn&apos;t breaded like KFC but crispy. Meat was juicy with a kick of saltiness."
5,"This place deserves its michelin star rating. The hot chocolate is out of this world. I&apos;ve never tasted anything this good in my entire life. It&apos;s $8 for a single hot chocolate but I think it&apos;s well worth it if you are visiting the city and want to experience a michelin star place. 

The ambience is incredible as can be expected of a michelin star place. The service is phenomenal, and of course, the hot chocolate is unbelievably good. Very rich and creamy. 

Definitely give this place a try for a nice after dinner dessert area or late night treat ."
5,"Easily my favorite place to have dinner in the city! My partner and I come here for our anniversary dinner on a yearly basis, and when people are in town I always try and take them here.

There are other places in the city where you could spend a ton of money, and don&apos;t get me wrong will probably still be great, but there&apos;s nothing that has beaten the flavors and ambiance of Mindy&apos;s for me. 

Menu is seasonal, and I haven&apos;t had anything I didn&apos;t like. Of course the hot chocolate is AMAZING, but also really rich so I&apos;d recommend splitting it if you&apos;re having dinner and hot chocolate for dessert."
1,"I&apos;m gonna be honest, I&apos;m pretty disappointed with this place. There are so many great reviews I was expecting this place to be awesome and I left unsatisfied. I came here on a Friday night and it was busy, but my friend and I sat at the bar. The place is cozy and cute and the bartender we had was great. The hot chocolate I ordered was called the Medium and it was so sweet I couldn&apos;t even finish it.. this is coming from a girl who LOVES sweets. As for dessert, I ordered the cheesecake and my friend ordered the pie. The pie had a nice filling but the outside was bland. I ordered the cheesecake which I thought I would love because I love everything cheesecake and well shocker the cheesecake wasn&apos;t good either. For two drinks and two desserts I spent almost $70 and didn&apos;t finish either. Super disappointed with this place."
4,"Mindy&apos;s is a Chicago favorite when it comes to sweets but also does a good brunch as well. It&apos;s typically crowded at peak hours so reservations are definitely recommended. We got seated promptly and was given a choice for window or wall seating. We ordered an oat milk hot chocolate which was delicious, came with a cute cube marshmallow. It&apos;s a bit big for one person, so it is shareable however they will charge you 3$ to split it into two cups. We also ordered the endless coffee which comes from Dark Matter Coffee and was delightful. We ordered the pancakes and the chorizo. The pancakes require a wait but it&apos;s definitely worth it, while the chorizo was extremely thick and rich in a bowl full with cheese. would recommend giving this place a shot as the brunch was pretty good"
5,"Well done Mindy&apos;s Hot Chocolate! 
I stopped in while I was shopping for a frozen hot chocolate. It was, phenomenal as always. The host who took care of my order heard me rave about the handmade marshmallows (the best part) and gave me an extra one for the road. So, I&apos;m a lifer. I just love this place. 
I love this restaurant and have been a patron since it opened its doors. 
I have had brunch on many occasions and you are a fool if you don&apos;t have dessert. Mindy is a James Beard award winner many times over. I&apos;m not sure if I can talk about her donuts without crying. 
Although honestly, every item I&apos;ve had at Hot Chocolate, Brussel Sprouts included, has been amazing. 
Huge fan!"
4,"Loved the Vibe here, super chill bar/resto to grab a few drinks and some apps. Although, we didn&apos;t eat, we only got some boozy hot chocolate and other cocktails, but the food smelled great. Our server was really helpful &amp; friendly as we were both first timers, but we ended up shutting the place down and didn&apos;t even notice until they shut off the great playlist that we were jamming to :)
I Will definitely be back to try the food and enjoy a few more cocktails."
5,"Mindy&apos;s is one of our favorite places in the city.  A perfect place for date nights, family dinners, and girls night out.

Favorites-
* The burger is one of the best in the city.  Delicious and juicy but not fatty.
* My husband loves the crab cakes appetizer and gets it as a meal.  He says they&apos;re some of the best he&apos;s ever had.
* I love their pasta- always forward-thinking but also so comfy that it fills your need for comfort food.
* Always get the brussels sprouts- crispy, tangy, nutty, delicious!

They have a delicious cocktail menu and a good wine list that pairs with their seasonal dishes.  

The hot chocolates are my favorite in the city, and I love to get their seasonal selection.  The hot chocolates are always enjoyable but don&apos;t leave you stuffed.  They feel like a treat.  

Ambiance-
The space is an open concept with an open kitchen in the back.  I am always impressed that with an open kitchen, the place is still calm and with clean air (e.g., not smoky).

We love going to dinner because it is very intimate and feels cozy and romantic.   Just know, the 2 top tables are up against the wall to the left and are a bit cozy (e.g., close to your neighbors). 

Service-
We&apos;ve always had great service and feel like their servers are trained well to suggest food/drinks to costumers."
