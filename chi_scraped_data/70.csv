5,"3 Arts Club Cafe is one of the places I enjoy going to in the City. The ambiance, service, food, and attention to detail is just beyond.  We came here for a birthday lunch and our experience was nothing short of amazing.  A must visit.  Coming back here for my birthday dinner in a few weeks!

For those wondering, the follow all COVID-19 precautions."
5,"We spent $145 bucks for two for brunch and we didn&apos;t even care. Ha! Pre-COVID we could never find a good time slot to check this place out for lunch. I decided to look to see if anything was available for brunch with one of my girlfriends this week. Yes! Finally I get a table! 
Located in the inconspicuous RH (Restoration Hardware) store is this beautiful, open, airy cafe, 3 Arts... I will admit I thought the service and ambiance was going to be a bit stuffy but it wasn&apos;t at all. The staff was attentive and pleasant. We decided to try a few things on the menu and created our own tapas style. That&apos;s where the $145 bucks came into play. It was worth it.
5 stars highest rating:

Coffee - 5 stars. I mean, coffee is coffee but this coffee was the right amount of mild, strong and smooth like they changed the filter when they were supposed to change it.

Avocado Toast - 3 stars, fresh, typical Avocado Toast, wasn&apos;t spectacular IMO

Truffled Fries -  5 stars Excellent

Shaved Vegetable Salad - 3 stars - a bit of cheese would have set this off better for me

Shaved Ribeye on Charred Garlic Bread - 4 stars, delicious. 

Salmon - 4 stars, perfectly cooked"
5,"I came here in October when more restaurants were open in Chicago (with proper social distancing of course). This place abided strictly to covid protocol which I appreciate. I honestly didn&apos;t expect much from the actual food because I knew that most come for the ambience and the experience.. but I was pleasantly surprised. 

If you&apos;re coming here please expect to spend some $$ but you won&apos;t be displeased with the taste and quality of the food. I got the RH burger with a side salad and my sister got the Truffle grilled cheese.. both were yummy!! These were very filling choices and I would love to come back the next time I visit Chicago."
2,"Did not even eat here!
Called for a reservation, was laughed at by the spotty Herbert who answered the phone.
&quot;Oh ha, sorry we are typically 2 weeks out for any type of reservation!
Hey then put that on your website you pretentious Muppet!"
4,"Always a treat to come with my girlfriends! We&apos;ve done many brunches and birthday lunches. We came again recently to celebrate Galentine&apos;s with the girls. 

Although a bit pricey, Food was good but we keep going back more so for the atmosphere. We went with a bottle of Rose, Arugula salad, artichokes, lobster roll, wild mushrooms, broccolini, and Shaved ribeye on garlic bread. 

Normally we enjoy brunch menu but we tried something new. Our favorites was the salad, artichokes, and lobster roll. Least favorite was the ribeye and broccolini."
5,"3 Arts Club Cafe is a nice little green getaway in the city for a meal. The RH burger is nice and delicious, the meat was cooked medium rare and was nice to chew. The RH scrambler was very good as the scrambled eggs were cooked to a nice fluffy runny texture."
4,"3 Arts Club Cafe has long been on my list of bookmarked places, but I&apos;ve always been turned off by its notorious wait for a table. I know, I know the whole point of being attached to Restoration Hardware is so you can kill time walking around while waiting, but I don&apos;t have the patience for that. Once I found out they started taking online reservations, I immediately jumped on it.

Food: The menu was way different than the hearty meat and potato dishes at almost every other Hogsalt restaurant, so I was a bit worried the menu was designed more for the gram than for flavor. And I&apos;m personally more of a burger and fries kinda guy rather than avocado toast.

Burrata w/ roasted tomatoes - The char on the sourdough really made a huge difference in the flavor. The burrata was super creamy as expected, but the char on the toast gave it a great smoky grilled flavor. While it was tasty, it was definitely overpriced at $23.

RH Scramble - These were probably some of the best scrambled eggs I&apos;ve ever had. Velvety and creamy without being too runny. The chives sprinkled on top of the bright and vibrant eggs were just picture perfect. 

RH Burger - This is the signature Sodikoff burger that appears on almost every one of his menus. The bacon was just as thick and peppery as Au Cheval, and the patties/cheese were identical to all the other spots. All it was missing was a perfectly fried egg. Again, the price point was just a little off. $23 for the burger alone and then another $6 for the bacon was just way too much for something that&apos;s almost $10 cheaper for the same thing at all his other affiliated restaurants.   

Overall, 3 Arts Club Cafe has a great combination of an amazing ambiance and solid food. Its menu didn&apos;t just look pretty, but it also came through in the flavor department. You&apos;re for sure paying an extra premium for the gram-worthiness of the place, but it&apos;s worth it to check out at least once."
5,"Did it really happen? Finally, the cafe has been re-opened and now I&apos;m calling all the people who know this spot, so that they could share this joy with me! One of my favorite places in Chicago! Be sure to drop by here and order at least an avocado toast (it&apos;s simply delicious!)"
5,"The burrata is omg! Seriously love that so much with the olive oil and tomato&apos;s, it&apos;s incredible. My other go to&apos;s are the burger, lobster roll and coffee! Oh don&apos;t forget the chocolate chip cookies, wow!

PS. If you want to dine in the most sophisticated and luxurious hospitality experience in Chicago, this is it. The staff are wonderful, the food is exceptional, and it&apos;s impossible to have one complaint.

They are back open at 50% and after the Covid experience in this pandemic, treat yourself to all the feels. The RH Chicago gallery and 3 arts club Caf√© is a state of the art experience like no other! 

Trust me, I know.

Enjoy!"
4,"Luxurious experience with good food to boot. Located in the Restoration Hardware store, prepare to get here early and stand in line (at least for brunch). There&apos;s plenty of fun stuff to look at while you wait though. 

The space itself is so unique and gorgeous. I felt like I was eating in a greenhouse or something. My friend ordered the smoked salmon platter and I ordered the broiled fish and we split a chocolate croissant. Everything was delish. Highly recommend if you have a guest in town, for a girls brunch, or anything really. It&apos;s a special and memorable dining experience and easy on the eyes! Note that I visited here about 1.5 years ago so the menu may have changed."
5,"This was the most luxurious brunch experience, I think I have ever had. The restaurant is so beautiful, with different dining room (and lighting) options. The food was absolutely delicious and worth every penny. The burrata appetizer (add prosciutto!) is simple but the ingredients are so high quality, it is all you need. We also shared the truffle fries, Caesar salad, cheeseburger, and ribeye sandwich. We also had various lattes and mimosas, and honestly I can&apos;t say disliked anything. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and unpretentious. Can&apos;t wait to come back."
4,"This place is just as aesthetically beautiful as I&apos;ve heard, but the menu was really pricey. I wanted to check it out and it was probably poor planning on my part because I thought I would just go get some drinks and an app to see the place... there wasn&apos;t a single appetizer under $20 and the drink menu was primarily wine. They had 4 beers and a mimosa on the menu, but no cocktails of any sort.  I also wanted to check out the rest of RH but it closed at 7.. right when we were done eating and drinking.

Again, I should have looked into it more first. We ended up getting some beers and split a burrata which was really good!"
4,"They&apos;re open during covid! Reservation only.

Came here with a girlfriend and I was pretty impressed. We arrived about 30 minutes early and had the opportunity to explore the furniture portion &amp; gaze in awe at all the furniture we couldn&apos;t afford. 

Once we were seated, I got to take in the scenery. Ambiance is gorgeous. Great for date night or an anniversary. They made sure we were all very well socially distanced and the staff was so friendly. Masks are required unless you are eating or drinking. 

The food was tasty but a bit over priced. But I think you come here for the vibes vs the menu. The dinner menu was also very underwhelming. I ordered the rib-eye on charred garlic bread, mushrooms, truffle fries &amp; Tempranillo wine. All yummy &amp; flavorful and pretty filling. They also have a  great wine list. 

Overall it was a good experience but I hope they expand their menu soon!"
5,"*Disclaimer: this update was done purely on my own decision and was not requested by RH.

This update is long overdue (way way pre-covid). After my review, the manager reached out to make up for our meal with another reservation. He genuinely cared about my experience at RH and offered to set up a dinner in California&apos;s branch since I had already flown back home. The meal there was extremely well done, service was impeccable, and I was greeted by the Yountville manager during my meal as well.

This restaurant truly cares about your meal experience, and I appreciate everything that was done to provide excellent dining service. I will definitely return when I come back to Chicago (post-covid)!"
5,"Best avocado toast I&apos;ve had. Roasted tomatoes could have made a meal in itself. There were two slices so this definitely constitutes a whole meal. The truffle fries were also exquisite. Great vibe with nice greenery. Helpful and professional servers who observed COVID precautions nicely. I like the approach that if the table puts on masks, this is a signal that they need help. Our friend had a birthday and we got a delicious chocolate chip cookie which was a nice touch. Nice to go sit on the comfortable couches afterwards."
5,"I love this restaurant! Not only gorgeous, but the food is delicious. Their chicken dish is the yummiest chicken dinner I&apos;ve ever had. The mash potatoes are silky smooth and the chicken is roasted to perfection. The broccolini is out of this world. 

The service was excellent as well. No complaints here. RH never disappoints."
5,"There may not be a more beautiful room to have lunch in Chicago than 3 Arts Club Cafe. 

We&apos;ve been here three times in the past few weeks - twice on days that were expected to rain - and each time the experience has been impeccable. 

The food is fresh and delicious. Service is understated and excellent. Come here for both. 

But the room - I want to live there. Unfortunately it&apos;s no longer a home for wayward women or I might figure out a way."
4,"I loved dining at 3 arts! I felt very boujee dining here... an absolute beautiful restaurant and furniture store. I was happy I was able to experience such a romantic setting. The prosciutto board was an A+. The entrees were a tad expensive for the quality but still enjoyed it nonetheless! Our waiter didn&apos;t check in on us during our experience, only to order and for the check which was disappointing."
5,Delicious food and coffee. Except the lobster roll is soo tiny. The burger is a better choice for your money.
5,"This place was very great for brunch and pictures! The cafe is full of natural light. Due to covid, there were limited seating so reservations were made prior to coming. Hand sanitizers were on every table. Everyone was wearing masks and if someone wasn&apos;t wearing one, the manager was telling people to start. Food quality was 10/10. I would come here again! Veggies were fresh and cheese taste was very strong and delicious!!"
