5,"Firecakes vanilla donuts are to die for!!!! I love the fluffiness and chewiness of the donut and the crunchiness of the topping. They are also SO PRETTY. Vanilla donut sounds pretty boring, but these are not those boring vanilla donuts. I really really recommend. Their pistachio old fashioned is also good, but nothing can beat the vanilla donut.
The line might seem really long. It is annoying to see people get in line (especially those younger crowds) wearing masks not properly- if they are even wearing masks. But if you don&apos;t see a bit crowd (which is quite rare), I definitely recommend that you give this place a try. Also the line might seem long, but will shorten quickly because only one person is allowed at a time inside."
5,"I was in DIRE need of some mind altering substances to help me forget the last 24 hours or my life.     Walking down Hubbard towards Rush street on my way to meet my dealer, i nearly blew past Firecakes Donuts due to my excessively quick and long stride.   

As I turned my head ever so slightly to the right I caught the reflection of my right profile in the stores front window.    &quot;Quiet Desparation&quot; was what I saw, not Hangry.

The scent of peanut butter and fresh Italian Dark Roast coffee hit me like a warm jet and I stopped in mid-air.      Suspended like a kite in a summer breeze I floated through the front door and assumed the position in front of the donut case.

Little sugary jewels sparkled like rubys and Sapphires in their trays.   My body ached for sugar like a man aches for s__ after a long absence from his wife or girlfriend.

Firecakes is the place to go for a donut orgasm in Chicago this Fall"
5,"These are my favorite donuts in the whole world.  I&apos;m from Minnesota, and haven&apos;t been able to have any of these donuts for a year since covid hit.  I miss these donuts!  I wish they would branch out to different cities--please come to the Twin Cities!"
5,"Delicious. I highly recommend the Red Velvet. The icing is bomb.

If you like Cinnamon Rolls, this is a great one."
4,"I got seasonal donut here.
Santa Claus face donut was so cute,also so nice.
There was no filling though.
Must try"
5,"Super yummy! The best we had in Chicago! 
We grabbed a sack full of donuts and ate them for dessert and breakfast! Was too cold
To do ice cream but will definitely try next time!"
3,Very nice walk in atmosphere and donuts presentation are top notch. Donuts have variety of different flavors and toppings appealing to the eye. Donuts were ok.
5,"Come here early in the morning so you can get more options for donuts!! My boyfriend and I came around 5pm and they were only offering about 5 different types of donuts. Yet, with just 5 options we tried 4 and they were all delicious. The coconut cream was a very good cake donut and the vanilla cream was an amazing yeast donut. You can&apos;t go wrong with there old fashioned. Prices weren&apos;t too bad, I just wish we would have gotten there early to try more!! Definitely worth the go regardless of the time of day. It&apos;s a cute and easy little donut shop to stop in while strolling around Chicago!"
5,"Amazing donuts. Looks great and so glad that the taste lives up to the looks. So many donuts got the looks but inside is just a sugary mash up. 

The Sprinkle Donut and Classic Jelly were excellent.  The doughs light and fluffy. The sprinkle and vanilla was spectacular, with a light hint of citrus flavor in it that was yum! The jelly, which was pretty generous, I expected to be sweet but was tarty, in a good way. It balanced well with the excellent classic sugar coat donut. 

The Birthday Cake looks amazing! Gotta go back to try it out!"
4,"I am a donut fiend, so when visiting Chicago I had to hit-up a local donut place. Firecakes Donuts had SO many options, that I am pretty sure I stood their for a good 10 minutes trying to decide. Thank goodness the lady at the counter was so patient with me! 

The location is pretty small and definitely a grab and go type of place. They had more options for food than just donuts, and I it&apos;s worth checking out for the unique seasonal variety of donuts they have to offer. Pricing wise though, I&apos;d say it&apos;s pretty on-par with what you&apos;d find with any other hip donut place in the city. (Pricier than your average donut, but totally worth it!)"
4,"Great donuts and okay ice cream sandwiches.fire cake donuts always come thru.8 months agoThis morning I ordered 2 cinnamon rolls and 2 donuts through Grubhub.I had the peach fritter and it was delicious.  It was rather expensive, but worth it. I would return ."
5,"I only had a 4 day trip to Chicago, but that didnt stop me from having Firecakes 4 days in a row! The first night I was just wandering down the street and found this tiny donut shop only big enough for one party at a time and had to go in.

There is not a ton of variety considering they are such a small shop, but I noticed they had different items on certain days.
My hands down favorite was the orange blossom cake donut. Old fashioned donuts are THE BEST and you cannot convince me otherwise. I also tried the espresso filled which was perfectly sweetened. I wouldn&apos;t reccomend the gluten free chocolate donut, though as it was way too dense (made with chia seeds).

The service was great and DONUT forget to try the icecream of the day. The sweet corn ice cream was surprisingly amazing."
4,"See attached photo. I didn&apos;t sample every donut but  we liked what we ate. Nothing was terribly sweet or dry. Interesting variety like pistachio and blueberry lemon. Our common favorite was the cinnamon roll. 

Major downside is it&apos;s a very tiny space so you can only order to-go and actually consider if there aren&apos;t too many people to wait behind."
4,"One of the best donut places in Chicago! Famous for their donut ice cream sandwiches which I alas did not try. Smooth ordering experience but had a bit of a wait in the line outside on a friday night since one guy was doing all the orders. I tried the vanilla donut with the crunchy beads and pistachio donut. both were well made, on the sweeter side but not too sweet. Of the two I would recommend the vanilla donut since it was so light and fluffy, good icing flavor, and crunchy beads were very nice. Pistachio donut was crunchy but the flavor of pistachio did not come through as well."
4,"Great place for donuts! Never really liked donuts as much, because sometimes it&apos;s too sweet, too dense, but these were delicious!! I got the lemon donut and the original glazed with the butter pecan ice cream. 

Lemon donut is a must get!! The filling is extremely lemony and the dough itself is soft and light. The icing has a tart taste, and the candies lemon rinds were unique for texture. I could&apos;ve omitted that and enjoyed that mre, but still, the donut was great!

The original was soft and chewy, very subtle flavor on the glaze. The butter pecan was creamy. I liked it! I just wished I had the donut warmed up, that would&apos;ve put the cherry on top!

Service was stupendous and I liked how they only allowed one party at a time inside to take precaution on the covid social distancing."
5,"Superior to any donuts I have ever had. The location is literally a hole in the wall, but they have a great selection! We walked really far, in the freezing weather to get there, and we were happy that we did!"
4,"COVID-19 Review: 

Came around 5:45 on a Saturday evening to pick up some &quot;desserts&quot; to share for a barbecue my boyfriend and I were going to. There was about 3-4 other parties in line ahead of us! Because Firecakes is so small, they let one guest / one party in at a time. They also have two tables for outdoor seating right outside the storefront.

We got the Lemon Donut, Old Fashion Buttermilk, two Chocolate Espresso, a normal Chocolate Glazed, and a Raspberry Jelly! There are definitely size differences between the donuts (e.g. the chocolate glazed is like 3 or 4 times the size of the Chocolate Espresso ones)! Loved all the donuts as usual, though I didn&apos;t try the lemon one since I don&apos;t always love lemon-y desserts. Everyone seemed to like it a lot though and the chocolate espresso ones were a hit like usual.

They&apos;ve really added a lot of new ice cream flavors and ice cream donut combos! Definitely stop by if you like good donuts. Price is obviously more than Krispy Kreme, we spent about $18? $20? on 6 donuts but worth it when they&apos;re fresh and unique in flavor! Only taking off one star because one of our friends has a severe soy allergy and it didn&apos;t really seem like the people working there knew much about this specific allergy though they easily told us which ones were dairy or gluten free haha!"
3,"I got in at 6:30 a.m. on one day, note to self: keep your head on a swivel - as it can be a little creepy around here. 

Anyway, once safely in, it&apos;s a cute little donut shop with a nice assortment of donuts. I&apos;m glad I got in so early because I can see them running out of certain donuts. 

Friendly service and they don&apos;t cram your donuts into one box. They&apos;ll put your dozen into two boxes and will tie those together with string - like an old fashioned bakery. Perfect because I had a half mile walk to the office. 

Because of this being a smaller place, in comparison to my Stan&apos;s, it had a more limited selection and was a tad more expensive. I enjoyed the green pistachio donuts the most and look forward to coming back."
3,"Firecakes does delivery, which is awesome! However, their menu through delivery is limited, and there were a lot of specialty flavors that weren&apos;t available. I placed a large order for my group, but only tried a couple of flavors:

-Pistachio Old Fashioned ($2.95): Just ok. I&apos;ve had versions from other Chicago donut shops that I liked better. The icing was too hard, and I didn&apos;t like the pistachio flavor.
-Malted Milk Ball ($1.00, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=EmViYC4YIVPAqG-blxBaSw&amp;userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- this was a tasty bite. I didn&apos;t get a lot of malt ball flavor, but I liked the custard filling.

I wouldn&apos;t order delivery from Firecakes again due to the limited selection, but I would give their brick and mortar a try if in the area."
5,"Coming to this donut shop is a treat itself! I love the many options they have here which makes it so hard to choose one favorite and end up leaving with a box full of donuts. Among the people I know who frequent that place, the Pistachio donut is their favorite. While I like that as well, I also like anything with the giant sprinkles, the jelly, the chocolate covered, the plain, .. ok fine, I like everything. You know why? It&apos;s because they make it so perfectly crisp on the outside while it is soft on the inside, freshly made daily, it&apos;s tasty, and goes fantastic with their coffee. Customer service is also great! For me, it&apos;s one of the top 3 donut shops in the city."
