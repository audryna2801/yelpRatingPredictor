5,"A group of friends made reservations at Summer House a few weeks in advance for Sunday brunch here. During the second wave of restrictions, they&apos;re only allowing groups of 4 people per table with outdoor dining. 

The space is absolutely adorable! I feel like I&apos;m in Santa Monica at a beach front restaurant. When you walk in, you&apos;re greeted by a pastry display case and an ice chest filled with bottled ros√©. They&apos;re patio/outdoor dining area is quasi indoors because you&apos;re covered by a retractable roof. They also have an &quot;outdoor&quot; section that is transformed when they lift up the garage door. 
The decor is very upscale beachy. 

Everything on the menu looks delicious. Again, I&apos;ve been craving cinnamon rolls, so my table started off with their mini cinnamon roll bucket, and they were delish! It&apos;s the cream cheese frosting for me. We also started off with mimosas. They don&apos;t do bottomless, so you can order one glass or a bottle of Prosecco and a carafe of OJ for like $40 I think. 

For brunch, I ordered the short rib hash with poached eggs. It was pretty good. Everyone at my table ordered different things and everyone enjoyed their meal. 

Service was amazing, and our waitress was so fun and made the experience! 
Besides dining in, they&apos;ve also crafted a to go menu for family size portioned meals as well as cocktails. 
As a heads up, there&apos;s a 4% charge on all bills due to COVID relief, but you can ask them to remove it if you don&apos;t want to pay it."
5,"This is a Covid review so it&apos;s technically both Summer House and Stella Barra combined right now. Still, this time around I tried more of Summer House and was greatly impressed. 

Because this place is all about summer, more than half of their roof is made of windows. Because of this, they can serve in their dining room with the roof and front windows open. Yes, it was a little cold in there, but it&apos;s December so we were prepared! 

Right now they are combining half of the menu with Summer House and the other half with Stella Barra. I actually like this a little better as they kept the &quot;hits&quot; from both restaurants. 

For our appetizer, we got the Chips and Guacamole. While the price looks a little high, it was a huge bowl of guacamole and chips. It also came with three really good salsas. This was well worth the price. We also got the meatballs which were very good, but just meatballs. It was simple, easy, and good so if you like meatballs, this is the dish for you! We also had some of the famous burrata (still excellent) and the roasted peppers (spicy!). 

For dinner we got two pizzas: Egg and Prosciutto and Sin Thin Sausage and Peppers (no onion). I&apos;ve had the Egg and Prosciutto before and it&apos;s always a hit! It&apos;s nice and salty with a real umami you get from cheese! The big surprise was the thin sausage and peppers. It was really crispy and tasty. My dad thought the sausage was a little spicy, but he loved this pizza as it had a great balance of flavors. Though not shocking, Stella Barra makes some great pizza. 

I also got &quot;Baby you&apos;re a firework&quot; for my drink which was like a fancy smoky margarita. It was outstanding and makes sense since Summer House is known for their drinks in non Covid times. 

I know that Covid had kind of killed the dining scene for the past year, but if you feel comfortable and dressed warmly, I would highly recommend this place! Right now, the menu is nearly perfect and has something for everybody!"
5,"This is the best of the Chicago patio dining places. We had a reservation, were seated early with decent distancing and the outdoor heaters really did well, we were very comfortable. The food and service were top notch. We will definitely be returning here, as in the age of COVID they are on top of it."
5,"Such a great experience here! Came for pizza from Stella Bara - and their menus are currently combined, so it&apos;s the best of both worlds. 

The pizza is phenomenal, tons of flavor for a pretty simple ingredient pie. And the crust is perfectly crunchy. The brussels sprout salad was fresh and unique - I&apos;d definitely recommend it with a pizza as a side, it was light yet filling. And wow, I dream about these thin and crispy fries... a huge side as well! 
We enjoyed a bottle of Pinot as well, which was a terrific pairing and reasonably priced. 

I can&apos;t wait to return to try the chopped salad and cocktails!

Our waitress was amazing, personable and helpful. We felt safe the whole time. Tables are well spaced and the space is ventilated. 

Oh! And DO NOT SKIP A SEA SALT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE. a must!!!"
2,"Ok this place has been one of our staple for a year now, personal and business gatherings.
Had a reservation for 1:30, we got sat at 2:00 in the pizza area? Having sat waiting for a table I saw the bar was empty! We did not get the option to dine in the main restaurant.
Slow slow slow! Poor guy who is working the bar, is rushed off his feet.
The useless second helper has taken 15 to take a table of fours order!
At these prices plus 5% for Covid plus an expectation of 20% tip, where do we draw the line???
If you are in no rush no agenda and could not care less about waiting 30 mins to get even a drink......
Then you won&apos;t be as mad as I am right now!
52 people in this back pizza joint! Two people working.... oh wait I lied another bar person just joined!"
5,Came here on multiple occasions. The service and the drinks are amazing. This is a great spot for maybe a little bite and a good drink (maybe a good place to take pictures for the gram too). Love their creative brunch menu as well. This goes on my classic and go-to lists!
5,"Amazing place to come for brunch in the Lincoln Park area of Chicago! I love a good brunch, and Summer House Santa Monica definitely fits that description.

Upon entering, you will find a spacious waiting area with comfy seating. The delicious cookies in the front lure you in too!

Once the full party arrived, we were seated right away. The interior is stunning, and you feel like you are not even in Chicago anymore! I felt like I was on vacay in the West coast! 

Summer house is bright, airy and beautiful! Perfect spot to gather with friends and catch up for a weekend brunch. Ambiance is everything!

We had an awesome waiter, and an overall great time. 

The mimosas are delicious and I already can&apos;t wait to go back for more!

Check this restaurant out if you haven&apos;t already!"
5,"Really cute spot. Easy to make reservations, not super busy, fast service. I would say it&apos;s a little on the pricier side for casual (my LaCroix was $4), but the food is amazing. Get the Brussels sprouts appetizer and the double cheese pizza, skip the vodka pasta. The pizza is super super thin and crispy, and the Brussels sprouts have amazing flavor. The desserts are also fantastic, their brown butter rice krispy treat is delicious. Overall would highly recommend, great food, great ambience, great location!!"
4,"Turkey Club Sandwich - nine-grain bread, bacon, tomato, lettuce, havarti, mustard. Switched out mayo for avocado.

Every ingredient was fresh. I liked that the bread was toasted. Turkey was moist. I would have liked more meat. The sweet potato waffle fries were a good balance of soft and crispy. 

In general, the menu prices were reasonable. Waiter was very nice and helpful. I liked the clean, spacious interior."
5,"Had a brunch date with friends after so long since quarantine and stay at home. They have nice indoor/outdoor seating, practicing social distancing  with the tables. Masks were required but can be taken off at your table, however you will need it if you get uo from your table. 

Service was good the food was delicious. I ordered the short rib hash, it was tender and flavorful. We enjoyed our brunch."
5,"Came here twice so this review is way long overdue. Was here for a friends birthday and had the best time. Our server Levi was so funny, sassy and attentive he made sure that our group had a great service for my friends birthday. We had Calamari and Tuna Tare Tare for appetizers and both were so delicious. 

I had the crispy chicken sandwich for my meal and the chicken was crispy and the bun was perfect and the sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly. I asked for a side of ranch because why not? It&apos;s a perfect combo.

The decor and the ambience for this restaurant is really cool it reminds me of California and Hamptons combined, it can get busy so I suggest reservations. During this time they check your temperature before you get seated, staff are all wearing masks and hand sanitizers provided. Overall had a great experience and Levi was really nice and friendly.

Check out Stella Barra next door for some good pizza too"
5,"We came here with reservations on a Tuesday afternoon and it was busy. They have a small area outside for about 3 or 4 tables that will allow dogs. The inside area is open and airy.

We tried the meatballs which were amazing and slightly spicy.  They have fun cocktails like banana hammock which my husband really liked.  The prosciutto and egg pizza was very thin and crunchy like a cracker. 

Very summer vibe and would come here again!"
5,"Best cookie I have ever had in my whole life! Wow!    I highly recommend the tuna with watermelon too. Super tasty and flavorful. The service is good, the interior makes you feel you are on beach house during vocation. Solid five stars! I can stay in there all day!"
5,"This is the cutest place in Chicago :)) Great for a date night or brunch with friends. The inside makes you feel like you&apos;re in California in the summer! While I didn&apos;t eat much, the guac was on point! Also, the drinks were popping!! Definitely try it out!"
5,Always love this place. Manager came over was very nice &amp; kept checking in. Friendly staff! Food came out quick and was delish
5,"I received a gift card to this restaurant due to a not so good experience at a different location and let me tell you......!!!! I AM HOOKED. From the moment I walked in I was treated with such friendliness from all the staff. I actually came twice in one week because I loved my whole experience the first time around. I decided to come for my birthday during brunch and was seated at their outdoor seating area. If you do not mind being bothered by bees then its ok but I hate bugs! The staff saw my child and I acting like babies and they did try to help which I really appreciated. During brunch I ordered the egg white omelette with turkey and chose an english muffin as my toast. This was very good and light. My child ordered the kids hot dog meal which comes with 2 small hot dogs, fries and fruit. We also ordered the egg tostadas and that was so delicious!. This  was very tasty and great for sharing. I ordered a latte and the lemonade special with tequila. Yes I love coffee and a nice drink! Both those were good. For lunch on my second visit I ordered the avocado toast with fries(they were able to split it for two people) and the Hummus starter. I loved both of them. The waiter also gave me a birthday cookie with a scoop of ice cream. That was literally the cherry on top. Thank you"
5,Great way to celebrate our 5th year wedding anniversary. The food &amp; drinks were amazing and the service was second to none even at the bar. The restaurant also does a great job at adhering to COVID guidelines.
4,"Great spot for dinner! My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner. The oatmeal cookies are a must when you come here. It was a pleasant surprise for us. We got the carbonara, burger, and spicy Hobbs pizza which was more than enough for the two of us. Great service and ambiance! I&apos;ve been here before for brunch and most definitely prefer having dinner here instead. Don&apos;t get me wrong brunch twas delicious but I enjoyed dinner more. 

Tl;dr come for dinner and order a ton of oatmeal cookies for a great time"
5,"I love Summerhouse!!! Their food is SOOO good, their drinks are amazing, love the atmosphere and the staff is always super friendly."
2,I really had the worst dine in experience in Chicago here. The service was so bad I actually debated cancelling my entire order and taking my friend somewhere else and the food was very cold. The ambience was nice and the pizza was really good but somehow also freezing cold so I&apos;m somewhat sad to have been served such a sour taste of this spot. Dining was indoors btw so I don&apos;t get how all the &quot;fresh&quot; food was so cold. But the service was colder.
