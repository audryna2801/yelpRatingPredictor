5,Came out to Bar Siena to the Short Rib Lasagna cause it literally warms you up all day and I so was not disappointed!  Heated COVID-19 tents surprisingly keep you crazy warm!  Everyone had on masks and the place was very clean.  Temp checks at the door and I excited to come back for parmesan truffle fries with truffle a√Øoli that&apos;s was the real GameChanger!   Thx staff for making a freezing pandemic make me feel normal for once.  Good start to 2021!
5,"Totally dig the vibe of this restaurant! The place is massive, offering lots of space for seating outside, indoors, and upstairs. After having our temps checked at the door, the six of us were seated in a large, spacious booth on the second floor. To our left, branches from a two-story tree sprawled up and over, wrapped in twinkle lights - so cool. I&apos;m a sucker for good aesthetic.

Our server Eric was super sweet and attentive. He had lots of recommendations and was certainly knowledgeable about every part of the menu. We started with cocktail orders all around. I went for the &quot;Number 8&quot; which a tasty drink made up of reyka vodka, stirrings peach, prosecco, lime, ginger zest, and mint. It reminded me of a Moscow mule, which I enjoy. The rest of the group enjoyed an array of other cocktails. All delicious, but a bit on the expensive side for what you get, in my opinion. 

The apps were a win! I could eat infinite amounts of those Parmesan Potato Skins. Super crispy, wonderfully seasoned and paired with the perfect truffle aioli. The Burrata was also great. The spicy apricot flavors really game through, and the candied pistachios gave it a nice little crunch.

I had the Bar Siena Chop salad for dinner and boy was it good. Packed with flavor it had salami and pepperoncini, blue cheese, egg, artichokes, red onion, cucumber, avocado, and parmesan breadcrumbs. I was particularly a fan of the smoked mustard vinaigrette it was dressed with. The Wild Mushroom and Garlic pizza was also fantastic, because who doesn&apos;t love white truffle oil. 

Note: they have a two-hour limit for guests, and masks are required when you enter, and each time your server comes to the table. Solid overall safety precautions here.

I would most certainly return when I&apos;m next in Chicago!"
5,This restaurant has accommodated us and many others inside of the business. Very grateful that they have indoor dining during COVID-19. Great food and beer. The only other thing was We felt a little rushed by the server unfortunately I will not be coming back here in the evenings make sure you come here with enough time to have dinner and not be rushed out. Although we did arrive within an hour of closing.
5,"My boyfriend and I dined here on Thursday and everything was I*N*C*R*E*D*I*B*L*E! Maggie made our dining experience TOP NOTCH by making us feel so at home in the restaurant and treating us like family in a place we have never been before. We loved her and the restaurant so so much and cannot wait to come back on a regular basis. The meatballs and short rib lasagna were such good recommendations! The number 15 and the number 4 cocktails were so on point for us!! Maggie you are a goddess and we cannot wait to see you there again boo! 

PS We&apos;ve been RAVING about Bar Siena to all of our fiends! Y&apos;all are doing it right! Thank you!"
4,"Ambience is really cute. That&apos;s a spacious two story Italian restaurant with a huge vibrant bar on the first floor and a massive dining room on the 2nd. That would be a perfect place for a small or bigger party. For a date night it was too loud and bustling.

The restaurant focuses on serving small plates, pasta and pizza, nothing can be better for a group. The food though didn&apos;t impress at all, despite the chef&apos;s fame. Pizza and pasta were ok, I got tagliatelle with wild mushroom, truffle butter and parm and pepp pizza to share. All the rest was just nothing to dream about. Gnocchi were undercooked. Octopus something close to rubbery.

Our server was nice, but they were either understaffed or too busy, too long wait.

I would definitely go back with a group of friends."
3,"Came here for brunch and was pleased by the service but overall underwhelmed by the food. I got the Classico and also tried the French toast. The French toast was by far the highlight, and I loved how the sour cherries balanced out the sweetness of the French toast. I also loved the thick cut bacon that came with the Classico. 

However, the rest of the Classico reminded me of a hotel breakfast. The potatoes were fairly flavorless and too crunchy. I couldn&apos;t taste the Parmesan at all. The eggs were ok but tasted like they were from a buffet. And the polenta toast was unexciting, not served with jam/butter, and was toasted too much for my taste. 

Overall, it was a decent brunch but not worth it for the price, especially when there are so many other brunch options in West Loop."
2,"My friend and I went here last night.
We get there at 7:15pm i ask if there was a table inside (there was only outdoor dining when the reservations
was made online) and luckily there was! Jump to 8:05pm we finally get our drinks, gave her our food order. Another man came to set up the pizza stands and i ask to speak with the manger. It was almost 9:00pm at this point. I told him i think she had too many tables because we were the only table INSIDE she was serving. Long story short the manger became our waiter and he gave us a free drink on the house. 
***FOOD AND DRINKS GOOD AND STRONG***
Probably wouldn&apos;t go back"
2,"PSA: I would not recommend dining at Bar Siena if you have to sit &quot;outside&quot; in the tent. It&apos;s not heated whatsoever and the tent has a ton of holes where the wind rips through. There was actually a huge pile of snow inside of the tent right behind me. It was not enjoyable. Some of the tables were separated by partisans, however, there was no clear walkway for the hostess with guests so they end up walking by right next to your table. If you are able to sit inside, I bet your experience will be much better than ours. 

We were seated in the tent right at the opening and I asked the hostess to please put us at one of the other 8-10 open tables away from the opening and she gave me a snarky attitude and said they were full. We were at Bar Siena for an hour and 20 minutes and half of those tables stayed open. Our server was MIA throughout our dinner. He only came to our table every 10 minutes or so which felt longer because we were so cold. When our food came out, we had to eat it immediately and quickly because within seconds it was cold from the wind and air temperature in the tent. We got the meatballs, which were not worth the $19 price tag. We also got the Parmesan fries ($12) and a pizza ($20). Somehow, our dinner ended up being $117 which was shocking. This restaurant is very expensive for what you get. There are plenty of great restaurants on Randolph Street that I would recommend over Bar Siena."
4,"Came in on a Saturday for late lunch- we were seated immediately upstairs with a reservation.  Ambiance is great, very modern.  Staff were all masked up and following Covid protocol.  They also have a heated tent outdoors for those uncomfortable with indoor dining.

Decided to try a couple different things and share- went with the Wild Mushroom &amp; Garlic pizza, Burrata Wedge salad and a side of Parmesan fries.  Everything was extremely tasty- the pizza is thin and just the right amount of toppings.  The burrata wedge was excellent, such a great combo of flavors with sweet grape tomatoes, salty bacon, tangy bleu cheese and creamy burrata.  The Parmesan fries were addicting.  

Highly recommend this spot for a cute date spot or a fun time out with friends.  There is a current 1 hr 30 min time limit on tables, but didn&apos;t feel rushed as food came out fairly quickly."
4,"Some COVID reviews aren&apos;t fair because restaurants are doing, presumably, the best they can under the circumstances. With that, there were definitely some awesome memories and some less than stellar from this experience. A friend and I had a reservation on a rainy night. No problem because everyone was talking about the warmth of the tent. What people didn&apos;t mention is all seats aren&apos;t heated equally. We were near the tent&apos;s opening and although near a small heater, it didn&apos;t do much to ward off the cold damp air. The upside: they had a few warm cocktails on the menu. After having a couple glasses of Mulled Wine and hot toddies, we definitely warmed up but not enough to comfortably remove outerwear. 

Thankfully our waitress was pleasant and the food was good. So good, we ordered and shared the Duck Mac n&apos; Cheese that came with swiss chard, wild mushroom, roasted garlic cream, roasted fennel and garlic breadcrumbs twice! I&apos;d definitely go back for that and try to other items just not sure it will be while there are still indoor dining restrictions. Even though, interestingly, there were definitely patrons eating inside the restaurant. Not sure how that was possible but maybe it would&apos;ve changed my experience."
4,"I like the vibe of bar Siena more than Siena tavern. A little more laid back, plus easier to get into. Similar cocktail menu. Recommend to split a pizza and a pasta."
4,"Been looking forward to trying this place out in the the West Loop! I came here last Saturday for brunch at 1:30pm. The outdoor tent was packed with people and there were a few tables being served inside. My cousin and I were seated outdoors inside a vestibule enclosure, not too far from the tent. There were three tables spaced out within 6ft apart, along with festive decorations hanging from the top as well as heaters (although they&apos;re not situated directly above the tables, you still feel the warmth until someone opens the goddamn door and sends chills down your spine if you ain&apos;t dressed properly). Also, Bombobar is situated inside on the other end! 

I ordered the short rib hash cause I love my meat and poached egg. My cousin got the lobster roll that came with the best fries I&apos;ve ever had (go try it for yourself), and we shared the breakfast pizza (highly recommend it!). The food came out quite fast and was hot, except for the lobster roll for obvious reasons. 

The Short Rib Hash was very flavorful and warm with the roasted garlic hollandaise sauce. Half way thru the dish it was a bit too salty for my taste bc of the meat, which was also very tender and juicy (just the way I like it). The poached egg was perfect, and the hash was crispy and in bite sized pieces, yummm! 

The Breakfast Pizza was the most aesthetically pleasing looking pizza I&apos;ve ever laid eyes on. Even the people walking by outside was checking it out lol. Just one gaze at this perfectly well down piece of dough with layers and layers of toppings and garlicky crust, I am sold! Plus, there&apos;s a freaking egg in the middle w/ a runny yolk! Can&apos;t get any better than that!! Ooooh wweeee, I would def come back just for the pizza and fries (separate order). 

I didn&apos;t catch the server&apos;s name, but she was very sweet and patient. I would definitely come back to try their dinner menu....hopefully with an actual date or not."
3,"Ambiance: 5
Food: 2
Drinks: NA
Service: 2

I wanted to like this place. I really did. They have a DJ playing in the middle of the day. Plenty of TVs beat the bar playing all the right games. Tents with space heaters outside. Cool interior decorating inside. 

But I just can&apos;t. And here&apos;s why. Had a lobster roll and it came with spinach. That&apos;s a violation. And if you don&apos;t know why ask anyone from/in Boston. It also was super mayonaisey. Fries were the best part of that dish. Then the service. I asked the manager when he walked by if he had a menu. His response - Yea we have a menu. Lol. Funny I guess but he had some attitude for some reason.  Dude it&apos;s covid...lots of restaurants just putting stuff online so felt like it was an ok question. But who knows. 

More important I didn&apos;t really feel like they prioritize safety amidst covid. At least not at the bar. Patrons aren&apos;t even close to 6 feet apart. And yes they have these plastic partitions sitting on top of the bar but I mean c&apos;mon? You have to lean over the bar to really be separated by a partition. And the bar wasn&apos;t clean. At least not the part where they sat me. 

I may give it another shot and try sitting outside next time maybe. But definitely won&apos;t get lobster roll. And I&apos;ll lower my expectations for service appropriately."
5,"It&apos;s cold &amp; wet outside today but warm(ish) and super welcoming inside at Bar Siena, and if your lucky enough to have Annemarie as your fun, spirited and knowledgeable waitress, you will love your experience here!   She highly recommend the Shortrib Hash for my Sunday Brunch choice snd she was so right!  Savory &amp; warm, full of flavor - just the perfect thing to warm your insides and make you feel cozy on a cold winters day in Chicago.   The Bloody Mary was like a yummy gourmet salad in a cup.   

The cozy setting inside or warmed up tent outside - the choice is yours right now but no matter where you sit or what you choose, you&apos;re in the right spot!    Hi"
5,The Bloody Mary is perfectly spiced and so good. Our waitress Annemarie (sweetest person) recommended the fireball pizza with truffle oil and it was AMAZING. Definitely best pepperoni pizza I&apos;ve ever had. She was so fun and nice and the atmosphere was also laid back but has really cool vibe. Couldn&apos;t have been better!!
4,"It&apos;s your average frat boy hang out, food is average to low quality, it&apos;s bar food. I like going here whenever I need a quick break from my area or usual places I go to. It is interesting to see the different sides of Chicago."
5,Their food is just so good! It never disappoints! Their service is good too! We had the meatballs which just melted in the mouth and my favorite was the bruschetta! It has goat cheese and mushrooms which is very different than a traditional bruschetta! We also ordered their gnocchi which was strictly ok! They have a huge tent with multiple heaters so great for socially distant meals too!
4,"This is a pretty good place to go during the pandemic, you can walk-in and find a table.

They do temperature checks as soon as you walk in! 

The food and drinks are pretty decent! I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the food, but this is a great spot for a last minute plan and it is safe. The atmosphere is dim lit and fun.

Tables are spread apart and they do not keep you close to anyone. 

Pre-pandemic: this place was so fun!! I have gone to various company parties here and they have been wonderful."
5,Annemarie is.. I&apos;m not gonna lie... the best waitress I&apos;ve ever  had. Her recommendations are amazing (meatball salad).  She doesn&apos;t give a crap if you your table is wobbly (ok she does) or if you just order lime and soda. The patio is warm and she is attentive - actually stay away
4,"I&apos;ve heard only great things about Bar Siena and needed to bring some folks here to check out. Initially half of us wanted steak and the other half wanted pasta so we decided that since this place has steak we&apos;d check it out. 

Unfortunately that was not a great idea. Half the party ordered their steak and it wasn&apos;t good at all.. no one liked it. It was cooked fine, there was just no flavor and it was tough. It wasn&apos;t tender at all or juicy. It was very odd. In fact my friend asked for ketchup in order to eat it... 

However, the pasta here was DELICIOUS. Oh lordy so good. I&apos;ve had better at other spots but that mac and cheese was really tasty. 

The service here was great. Our server was very nice and knew that we didn&apos;t enjoy our steaks and substituted one for a pasta. Their covid restrictions are the usual. And They have tents outside but have tons of heaters to keep you warm. 

Overall I&apos;d come back for pasta and that&apos;s about it. The steak wasn&apos;t good at all but I&apos;m leaving 4 stars because the pasta and service was just that good and after-all it is an Italian food place."
