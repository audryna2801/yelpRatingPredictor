5,"If I could only have one true love, it would be Velvet Taco.  Everything I have tried here is truly amazing.  It is difficult finding tacos in the city that aren&apos;t tiny 2-biters on a soggy corn tortilla.  Velvet Taco does not have authentic tacos by any means, but they don&apos;t try to!  Each one is unique and packed with flavor.  My personal favorites are the spicy tikka chicken, Nashville hot, grilled flank steak, and the chicken and waffles taco!  My fianc√©&apos;s favorite is the cuban pork and buffalo chicken.  

The portions are great! If you order two tacos and a side you will be satisfied.  But surprisingly these tacos reheat pretty well if you order more. 

Do not finish placing your order without a side of the elote and red curry coconut queso, I actually dream about these sides.  

During this pandemic we have probably ordered VT one or twice a month, and I don&apos;t plan on stopping anytime soon!"
5,"We&apos;re temporarily living downtown and are now within walking distance of Velvet Taco! I love this place despite the name. Everything is delicious and the taco combinations are very unique. I&apos;ve given up meat for Lent and highly recommend the  Shrimp &amp; Grits taco! Even when I am eating meat it&apos;s my favorite taco in the menu. The falafel taco in lettuce wrap was also tasty and perfectly spicey. I try to stay away from processed foods, but I make an exception for their coconut queso, the flavor combination is delightful. I was a little skeptical, but once I tried it I couldn&apos;t get enough of it and there isn&apos;t a good substitute anywhere else. Seriously, try the queso! 

Due to the COVID pandemic we ordered ahead and the pickup was easy and seamless."
5,"Velvet is such a solid spot for some unique tacos! Whether I&apos;ve gotten them for lunch, dinner, takeout/deliver with Covid, or as drunk food pre-Covid, it has ALWAYS hit the spot. My absolute favorite is the Nashville Hot Tofu! It&apos;s perfectly spicy and the pickles and sauce cool it down! The Fried Paneer is also really good! They recently added a new veggie friendly option: the beer battered cauliflower and it is SO SO SO good. The app also allows you to swap out protein in most of the tacos, so I&apos;ve had the buffalo chicken and chicken tikka with tofu as well! The sides are great too! The elote is so good and I used to always get the red curry coconut queso - which is good, but the Queso blanco is amazing and even better!! The tacos will run anywhere from 3.75 for some of the veggie tacos to 5.50 for some of the meat ones. I can&apos;t speak for the meat ones, but the veggie ones are a really good value for what you get!! They also pack everything well for takeout and delivery [which is so important nowadays]! Overall, one of my faves!"
5,"Pretty good tacos. I loved it. I ordered the Buffalo chicken, rotisserie chicken, and spicy tikka chicken and the fish and chips.

My favorite would probably be the fish and chips. I am biased for fish tacos. Second favorite was probably the Buffalo bc I always love a good chicken tender. 

The one I liked the least was the chicken tikka, only bc I don&apos;t like rice and didn&apos;t realize it had in there. Other than that flavor was good. 

I liked the rotisserie because it had a lot of freshness to it like lettuce and tomatoes, and corn."
5,"Intro: This restaurant serving delicious specialty tacos is a place that attracts locals and tourists alike. Every trip I make to Chicago, I either make it a point to go here or we just find ourselves here because a friend in the group suggests it. As with any place this popular, expect a line if you visit during dinner hours.

Getting There: It is located a bit of a walk off west of Michigan Ave (Mag Mile) but definitely worth it. As you might have guessed, parking is pretty near impossible near the restaurant.

Food: They serve various specialty tacos: breakfast-themed, pork, chicken, beef, vegetarian, you name it. Each of the ingredients in each taco is carefully planned out and ensured to give a great balanced taste. Regardless of whatever your flavor profile is and whatever you&apos;re craving, I guarantee there will be something that  fits your palate. Lately, they have also been serving weekly specials (&quot;WTF: weekly taco special&quot;) . The week I went, they were serving alligator meat (pictured on far right).

Here are a few of my favorites that I personally like:
Buffalo Chicken (pictured 2nd from left): Imagine a classic buffalo chicken recipe with ranch and ream. But you get all of that delicious flavor in a single hand-held bite. This is that. 
Along the similar vein is the spicy tikka chicken taco. Similar idea, but slightly different flavor profile (buffalo chicken spices versus spicy tikka chicken spices)

Brisket and Eggs (pictured far left): I personally am not a huge fan of breakfast foods (especially not at breakfast time). BUT if you are someone like that, the breakfast themed tacos are going to be right up your alley. The one I tried are the brisket and eggs, which mimics the classic steak and eggs taste so many people enjoy. Topped with pico and cilantro Plus its gluten free!

Nashville Hot Tofu : The vegetarian themed tacos are no joke. They may not have meat but they compensate that with delicious, bold flavors. The Nashville hot tofu is a great blend of spice from the tofu and acid from the pickles. A match made in heaven. Not pictured, but along the same alley (if you&apos;re a fan of spices) is the Fried Paneer Taco.

Kobe Bacon Burger (pictured 3rd from left): What if you can have a delicious burger but as a taco? I never asked myself that but if you ever did (or if you&apos;re curious now), this taco is the answer. Of course it will never perfectly imitate a burger but it comes pretty dang close.

Shrimp and Grits: If the seafood themed tacos weren&apos;t pricier, I would get them every visit. The one I did try, the shrimp and grits taco, is quite tasty. The combination of shrimp along with grits served with a salsa to add some acid works very well as a taco filling.

Final Say (tl;dr): If you find yourself in Chicago and you want a nice taco meal (or a snack), definitely check this place out. There&apos;s something for everyone (unless you really dislike tacos)."
5,"Velvet Taco!!! Had to order it for the name, had to Yelp it for the tacos!!
Yes, I am from San Diego, why pray tell, would I choose tacos in Chicago? Why ask why, just know they were delicious. Tacos taken to the next level. We ordered 6, and it was definitely a tough choice. Buffalo chicken taco? Yes please! Crispy spicy, and a generous about of blue cheese. Korean beef? Uh huh, get in my belly!! Sweet and spicy deliciousness. You know what else?Barbacoa nachos, that&apos;s what else! Noteworthy honorable mentions also include the salmon taco and the green Chile pork taco. 
The tacos were fantastic and super creative, we definitely enjoyed the shake up to the traditional taco. Now back to San Diego where  I may be making some suggestions.... :)"
5,"My new favorite taco place in Chicago, hands down! The menu is so creative, using tacos as a vehicle to pull together the best parts of many cuisines. All the tacos were balanced and did not skimp on the protein, which usually is a gripe of mine with affordable taco joints. Our favorites were the chicken and waffle, fish and chips, brisket and eggs, and the rotisserie chicken. 

Great service - Brandon had on-point recommendations and made our day! The place felt clean and safe. Their sauce is tasty and not as spicy as it looks. Cool decor. We&apos;ll be back for more tacos and to try their red velvet cake for sure."
4,They had a ton of creative taco creations and it was easy to accommodate dairy free. Tons of room in upstairs seating. 4 stars because the food took awhile to make. Would recommend.
5,"I can&apos;t tell you how much I love Mexican food but tacos in particular are my favorite thing ever and this place does not disappoint. A friend of mine told me about this place so I thought I would check it out while I was visiting the Windy City, and I&apos;m so happy I did. 

My favorite thing about this place is that they have specialty tacos and not just your regular chicken or steak tacos which is nice but sometimes experimenting with tacos can go bad however they have mastered it. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits ,Spicy Tikka , and the Fish and Chips taco. And to my surprise every single one of these tacos tasted amazing, I was completely shocked because I didn&apos;t think you could do a shrimp and grits taco and have it taste good but i was wrong. 

If you live or are visiting Chicago this is the place to go if you want really good tacos that are unique. I can&apos;t wait to come back here and try all the other ones!"
5,"I&apos;m here for everything that Velvet Taco has to offer. I love a good specialty taco, and Velvet is your place for just that!! I ordered my tacos to go and the experience fast, and the staff was friendly the entire time which made the experience that much more enjoyable. I am a sucker for quality customer service, and they nailed it! 

I ordered the &apos;Shrimp and Grits&apos; taco, the &apos;Chicken Tikka&apos; taco, and Elote. 

Shrimp and Grits Taco: I know, I know, I know grits in a taco does not sound good, but IT&apos;S A MUST TRY! The grits were fried with cheese, the shrimp were blackened and well seasoned, with a salsa and a corn tortilla! Honestly may favorite taco here!

Spicy Tikka Taco: The taco came with a SPICY chicken tender with spicy tikka sauce, basmati rice, and raita crema. It was so so so so bomb, but also very spicy just be aware!

Elote: Was great it was very &apos;traditional&apos; but had all the fixings, a lime, and was very creamy which is a personal favorite for me!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Go get you some!!"
4,"Tried them for the first time tonight after walking by dozens of times and they were really good! I got the tofu taco and fried cauliflower. Both had great flavor. I also got a to-go bottle of frozen margarita and it was delish. Taking one star off because some of their tacos are pretty pricey for one taco - I think $5-6 is a lot for a single taco. Will def be back tho, and looking forward to trying more of the tacos as well as the sides. Also - ordering ahead of time and pick up was super easy. I suggest ordering directly from their website instead of a third party."
4,"Cool taco options! 

Placed an order (9 tacos) for pick-up and it was ready to go in 10 minutes!! I was shocked how fast the tacos were prepared. 

Quite a good selection for vegetarians. Options include: Nashville hot tofu, fried paneer, falafel, and beer battered cauliflower. I got three tacos (1) Nashville hot taco (1) fried paneer and (1) beer battered cauliflower. All three were good! 

The Nashville hot tofu was sooo unique. Definitely recommend trying this out because I have never seen this option anywhere else. The tofu was not bland whatsoever. The hot sauce was not too spicy. The pickles added a nice touch. They were thinly sliced so it wasn&apos;t difficult to bite through/chew. 

Second favorite had to be the beer battered cauliflower The pico was absolutely delish. Loved that the veggies were cut into small pieces. The queso blanco was extra creamy and yummy. 

Fried paneer was pretty good too!! The other two people I was with got spicy tikka chicken and steak tacos. They really enjoyed it as well!! 

Only downside is that the tacos are pricey."
5,"If you can&apos;t tell by the line outside the door at nearly all hours of the day, Velvet taco is extremely popular. However, they also happen to have excellent food. The menu is unique and interesting. There is a South Asian twist to their offerings and the tacos are pretty substantial so two was plenty for me. I wish they had more locations because this one is perpetually inundated with people waiting for their food. The service is a little slow but considering how high the volume is, it&apos;s forgivable. 

Definitely try the chicken Tikka tacos if you&apos;re here. Rice inside a taco seems like a strange combination but the reality is: more carbs is always a good idea. Make sure to also get the red velvet cake as well, it&apos;s delicious."
4,"I went here a few times earlier this year, and for over 6 months after, everyday+any time I left my house to go anywhere, Google maps would automatically spam me with a notification &quot;xxx minutes to Velvet Taco&quot; regardless of whether or not I had the app open, and regardless of where I was going. 
If that&apos;s not subliminal messaging, I don&apos;t know what is! So I guess I need to write a review :P 

I love the tacos here. They&apos;re more of your &quot;fusion&quot; tacos rather than traditional. They serve them on flour tortillas which may be a sin depending on who you&apos;re asking (I think there&apos;s an option to do corn though). 
My favorites are always the chicken tikka and the Buffalo chicken. I&apos;ve had others, and they were all delicious as well, but these two are my absolute favorites. 

I&apos;m hoping now that I&apos;ve publicly announced my love for Velvet Taco, my maps will stop guilting me and let me leave my house in peace hahaha."
3,"Made an order for 11 tacos at roughly 12pm on a Sunday and the tacos took about 30-45 minutes to get. After we left, we realized we were missing one of the vegetarian tacos that we had ordered... 

As for taste, most of the tacos were pretty tasty but some were very salty. Also, I can&apos;t tell you which ones were what cause the tacos weren&apos;t labeled! Especially tough cause we had to figure out which ones were vegetarian."
1,"Please improve well done cooking, if can, it will be the best Taco place however, last couple of months they lost cocking abilities. Despite I insist couple of times while I am ordering, I can&apos;t get well done burger Taco which is insane"
5,"I&apos;ve been on a major taco kick lately and my taste buds are ecstatic about it. We were in the mood for a late night bite Saturday night and chose Velvet Taco because they were open late (5am late to be exact)! 

We got here right at about 2am and missed a huge rush of people. We ordered and snagged a seat within 5 minutes of walking in. My friend and I got a few Rotisserie chicken tacos (which are also gluten free and a huge bonus because my friend has that allergy.)  This tacos came with a queso blanco and roasted corn pico that flavor blasted together. The texture of the corn was extra crunchy and made the taco. The charred tomato poblano salsa had a good taste without being too spicy and they double wrapped the corn shells so they held up well. 

I also got the Slow-roasted angus brisket and let me just say I didn&apos;t talk the entire time I was eating this one. It was barbacoa style and the red chile mayo was so creamy and complimented the meat so well. The show stopper however was the encrusted flour tortilla. It tasted like it was deep fried and then sprinkled with cheese!? Wow. I really haven&apos;t tasted anything like this taco before and it far exceeded my expectations. I needed to take a shower after eating these because they got a bit messy. #WORTHIT

The associates were all kind and patient especially with the large noisy groups flying in and out of the place. They also had a security guard there which is nice to see just in case things got out of hand with the crowds. All the tacos were reasonably priced and I highly recommend you check this place out if you&apos;re in that area!"
5,"Coming from LA, I have high expectations when it comes to tacos and definitely a slightly elitist attitude when judging authenticity (hey at least I admit it!)

I don&apos;t think the food at Velvet Taco is exactly going to tug at the heartstrings of our friends south of the border. Nevertheless, the product that this small taco shop puts out is top notch and the fusion aspect of the food really becomes a unique strength. I&apos;ve come here each of the three times I&apos;ve visited Chicago and it&apos;s because the variety of food here is simply that good. Standouts for me include the chicken tikki masala taco and the fish taco - super fresh, flavorful, and healthy. 

Adding on the convenient location in River North, prompt service, and prices that won&apos;t break the bank means an excellent experience overall. Easy 5 stars!"
5,"Ok - so, I&apos;m no Taco connoisseur by any means, but I do know good food when I see it. Obviously this is Yelp - so in my opinion This is how these fusion-hipster ironic taco places should be! They&apos;re doing everything right - straight from thier bold flavors, taco varieties, and the fact that you can buy 1 taco at a time vs others where you&apos;re forced to buy 2 or 3 per order. 

I got 3 tacos - which was a perfect amount. They definitely have a good amount of protein and were packed with flavor. My fave was the chicken tikka which had a good heat level. The chicken &amp; waffles was good as well - it was surprisingly unique and was a big fan of the taco waffle and that it was not too sweet.

The dining area is small and limited - but i saw a lot of people take to-go orders and seemed to be door dash friendly. 

I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"First time here. Got the &quot;Cuban Pig,&quot; the &quot;Chicken Tikka,&quot; and the &quot;Korean Pork&quot; tacos. The first two were great. Full of flavor and definitely original. Very satisfying. The Korean pork taco was not great. It was pretty much just a barbacoa taco with some &quot;Korean&quot; toppings. And it was a relatively forgettable barba taco at that. Plus it&apos;s got a lot of watery juice on it. And they serve the tacos in open ended metal sleeves. With no plates or trays beneath them. Which means all that watery taco juice ended up all over my pants the minute the taco dude handed me my order at the pickup window. 

The chicken tikka taco was delicious. Isn&apos;t &quot;chicken tikka taco&quot; fun to say? 
Try it a few times."
