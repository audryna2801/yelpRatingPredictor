5,"Beyond stoked with the sushi here! 

A foodie friend recommended us to get the best sushi for unbeatable price in Chicago. How can we say no to sushi and good sushi without lightening your wallet too much!?

The menu was clear and the ordering of the sushi was efficient. A clean venue &amp; kitchen with quite a number of staff working efficiently to put the orders together. You can tell that they are popular from the number of ready to pick up sushi platters. 

We ordered a platter of sushi, but rather than order from the set platters available, we opted to order sushi our family love, we love anything with salmon!

The presentation of the platter was beautiful and the highlight was the sushi itself. Really good sushi with fresh salmon and fillings. 

Highly recommend this place even if it means traveling the distance to get here! If they open up in the western burbs, I will be there at least once a week for sure!"
5,"Unless you are doing an omakase or high-end thing somewhere, this is really the ONLY place in Chicago you should go. 

1. Quality. They do so much business so the sushi is always super fresh. I&apos;ve tried going back to takeout from other places and I&apos;m completely shocked by the difference in quality. 

2. Consistency. Never had an issue with them forgetting something or a difference in preparation.

3. Price. There&apos;s simply no comparison. It&apos;s basically half the price of anywhere else."
5,"So good - the cheapest and freshest sushi here in Chicago.

Tip: since the individual sushi/sashimi pieces are not that much more than a full set, choose the ones you love - mix and match!

Takeaway only during Covid. Call ahead, order and bring cash."
5,"Still my to go place if I am craving for some sushi fix.

Sushi does taste better when you put em on your own wooden llate"
4,"TL:DR - Great value for their sushi. You can get good quality fish without having to pay an arm and a leg. I&apos;d stick with the individual pieces of sushi or order specific rolls. Party platters have a lot of filler. Large orders get packed on a sturdy metal platter which is great for entertaining or bringing to a get together.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lawrence Fish Market is no where near the literal &quot;best&quot; sushi I&apos;ve ever had. But I don&apos;t think it&apos;s trying to be either. Lawrence Fish Market is the place to get very good quality, fresh, and cheap sushi. But I do think there&apos;s a bigger emphasis on a low price point than anything else. But cheap here doesn&apos;t mean poor quality, you can have your cake and eat it too here.

But we ordered a few rolls and a few pieces of sashimi. The first thing about their menu that stuck out was just how cheap the sashimi was. It&apos;s about $1 a piece for most items. They also have tons of options that you can&apos;t find at you&apos;re typical sushi join, like super fatty pieces of blue fin tuna. I liked ordering individual pieces of sushi or specific rolls, I feel like most of the party trays contain a lot of fillers like california rolls or spicy tuna/salmon type of rolls.

Aside from that, large orders come on nice sturdy metal platters, which is great if you&apos;re entertaining or bringing it to a get together. All in all, you get a really great value here for the price and quality of fish. Perfect place to really enjoy sushi without worrying about the price tag."
5,"Lawrence Fish Market totally lives up to the hype!  Great tasting fresh sushi with amazing prices-what&apos;s not to love!? Since it was only for the kids and me, I got the smallest maki platter which came with 5 rolls for only $20.  I also added the specialty Texas Crunch roll; can&apos;t believe I came home with a nice platter of sushi for only $28+ tax.

We arrived around 4pm on a Saturday and only had 2 people before us in line, plenty of metered parking in front. Don&apos;t forget to bring cash, no cards accepted.  There is an ATM onsite if you&apos;re like me and forget about bringing enough cash.

I&apos;ll definitely be back, totally worth the trip into the city to get the best bang for your buck sushi especially if you are going to feed a large party."
4,"Excellent prices for fresh sushi! First, know that Lawrence Fish Market is a takeout-only place. Also it&apos;s cash-only. If you&apos;re able to overcome those two barriers, then you should definitely consider them for a sushi night. My party of 4 got a big platter of 8 rolls for only ~$48 including tax and tip, and we were all very full by the end of the meal (this was with us picking out which ones we wanted). I think the rolls were all very good, albeit pretty basic. I also thought each piece was oddly thick which made it slightly harder to eat lol. However the fish tasted fresh. If you&apos;re a no-frills kind of person for sushi, this is the place for you."
5,"Little did I know that I would find such a rare and affordable sushi place in that busy street of Chicago! Everything was amazingly fresh and cheap in price. 
The sushi platter from picture only costs $22. Isn&apos;t that exciting? Apart from that I got Otoro and Chutoro. I was in Chicago for only a week and I went here twice...now I&apos;m missing this place like crazy! 

Parking is not an issue, plenty of street parking. We ordered ahead of time over the phone, so just went in and picked it up. That way, you don&apos;t have to pay for parking. They might not have a dine in area but they surely have good quality sushi! Give it a try.."
5,Always great fresh sushi! Highly recommended this to my dad and he finally got a sushi platter today. We ordered C2 which was $36 total. It was all made quickly and he said all of it was delicious! Just be sure to have cash on hand for payment. Everyone must try this place!
4,"Dropped by for another sushi fix takeaway

I ordered earlier in the day for pickup at 4pm.  Had to wait about ten mins for the order upon arriving, as usual around that time of day the sushi is churning and all the folks in the kitchen were busy rolling and slicing.  All the staff was properly wearing masks and upon arrival they ask you for the phone number you placed the order under.  Hand sanitizer is provided.  

It&apos;s cash only and seems like they have a dedicated loading zone parking. 

Since I had to wait, I noticed they have a small grocery section where you could fetch some soy sauce or spicy mayo among other condiments.  I like how they renovated, there&apos;s table seating for when it&apos;s allowed again.  

I ordered the sushi tray A which gives some good variety along with some additional sashimi and nigiri along with some additional rolls like negihamachi and spicy scallop.  

I really enjoyed the hamachi roll and the scallop rolls as they were very yummy.  Smooth texture and fresh.  The green onions were perfect with the yellow tail.  

My super white tuna was a tad squishy on texture this time, not sure why that was the case, maybe thawing process.  

I liked how they gave me a ton of pickled ginger and wasabi, I always go through it fast.  

It satisfied the sushi fix."
4,Called a day ahead for a pickup order around lunch time.  It was very easy to call the order in and the lady taking the call asks for your number to verify the order.  We ordered an A2 maki tray along with some ala carte nigiri.  The pricing is still great.  The quality though for the maki seemed not as great as I had remembered.   Overall the value for the sushi at Lawrence can&apos;t be beat.
5,Consistently awesome sushi rolls and sashimi! Great rice to fish ratio! And we were able to get a whole tray in 30 minutes (on a busy Sunday evening).
5,"Okay, came back a second time. Everything tasted fresh and I was very happy with the quality! Will be back again - tip is to come earlier in the day or during off-peak hours because it can get pretty busy."
5,"A cool gem that keeps its local family-owned charm. Found the next place to meet my sushi cravings.

Heads up: It&apos;s cash-only. ATM inside.

Lawrence Fish Market isn&apos;t set up like a regular sushi spot. It&apos;s set up more like a fish market that happens to serve sushi. It&apos;s located in Irving Park which is luckily away from tourist crowds and is great for people &quot;in-the-know.&quot; Lines do form but they are manageable. Expect a 20-45m in-and-out typical wait.

Price is $$-$$$ but is worth it for the quality (and quantity) received. Trays are great for sharing with family and friends. The presentation is great for Insta pics as well.

The selection of add-ons is also great as well. With every flavor of Ramune you can imagine and a ton of chips, ramen, and canned coffee, and even a 1-gallon container of mayonnaise on sale, Lawrence Fish Market has everything one could want to go with their sushi.

5/5. Favorited in Chicago. Worth taking a friend or a date for casual sushi night."
4,"We&apos;re a big fan! They are the best bang for your buck in town.  You can get basic rolls for ~$4 and nigiri for under $1.50. Quality is pretty decent considering prices.  Sometimes the tuna is less fresh.

We used to get their tray package but learned that it&apos;s better to build our own trays for less fillers and things we like more. 

We usually order this tray for around $90
- 2 spicy salmon rolls
- 2 spicy tuna rolls
- 2 spicy scallop rolls
- 2 spicy super white
- 5 unagi rolls
- 5 tuna nigiri
- 5 hamachi nigiri
- 5 unagi nigiri
- 5 salmon nigiri

TIP: cash only, order beforehand to pick up"
5,"How have I not reviewed Lawrence Fish Market yet? Is it because I want to jealously guard their delicious, affordable sushi? Is it because I don&apos;t want them to become supes famous and expand to quantity and lose the quality? Sure. But enough is enough."
4,"First time coming to this place and imho it is better than any sushi buffet that exist in Chicago such as sushi taku, sushi para or Royal city sushi. I ordered the party tray B for $35 for 2 people and the nigiri were fresh, the egg sushi was fluffy and have the egg aroma and the wasabi is really spicy. 

Pieces may be tiny but the freshness and quality makes up for it.

Give this place a try!!! They only take cash $$$. Metered street parking outside."
3,"We like to splurge once in a while at Lawrence&apos;s and got sushi platter last Saturday. The quality of fish is still good but feels like portion has been reduced. We used to be absolutely stuffed after we finish but this time is just ok, even though we ordered a larger platter then usual. Some of the fish slices were pretty darn thin compare to what I remember. Still good value, but not as good as before."
5,"I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve never been here before. I&apos;ve definitely been missing out. Lawrence Fish Market is much more than just a fish market, they also offer some of the best sushi in the city that money can buy. The owners are very nice and you can tell appreciate all of their customers. They do have about six tables inside, but this place is no doubt meant for take out. 

This isn&apos;t your ordinary dine in restaurant where you order one roll for $18 and don&apos;t even get full. Lawerence Fish Market offers options ranging from A1 5 Rolls 31 pieces for $20 all the way to A11 19 rolls 151 pieces for $150. We opted for their A3 8 rolls with 50 pieces all for just $40! You get Rain Dragon, kamikazu, Arizona, spider, California, spicy tuna, and crunch salmon. They were all very delicious and tasted fresh. You get them in a party tray and tightly assorted and organized.

This is definitely going to be my go to sushi place whenever I&apos;m not really trying to dine in, and just enjoy some sushi in the comfort of my home. I&apos;ll be back very very soon!"
5,"Inconsistent experience but great value.

This place is a Chicago classic. A stalwart of Chicago sushi experience.

Some background fact

1.  The way they do their sashimi is without marination or seasoning. It is the.korean way
2. Sashimi has bigger cut (I mean you don&apos;t get the rice(
3. Please pre order to not wait


There is no denial that there are times the fishes are fishy. However the good outweighs the bad. Even on a bad day, at that price point, it is acceptable."
