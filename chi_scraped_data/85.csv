5,"came here for takeout for my birthday. I was able to call ahead and my order was ready in 20 minutes. this is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.

broiled octopus - so tender and super flavorful
veggie side - very soft and flavorful
greek salad - i think this may have gotten a little more basic due to the pandemic? still very refreshing with the greasy meat dishes"
5,"I am totally in love with the food here, one of the best greek food i&apos;ve tasted in Chicago, it reminds me of my trip to Santorini. Top notch food and good ingredients. Service is  satisfactory and social distancing guidelines are followed. Nice place for a meal with family"
5,"My husband and I were able to do the outdoor dining as weather was  gorgeous this time in November. Service was good; quick and to the point. Can&apos;t say much for ambience as we ate outside, but inside it is spacious with many rooms, and exudes an old-timey greek feel. Food was delicious. I ordered the pastitio, and was given a huge piece. My husband ordered the kokkinitso (braised lamb) and said it was good as well. 
Unfortunately Greektown has been losing many of its greek restaurants, and this is one of the few places that remains. If you can, definitely order for pickup here, it won&apos;t disappoint!!"
5,"My family and I have been coming here for as long as I can remember and, other than a couple years ago when the new chef at the time changed the recipes, I&apos;ve always loved the food. My favorite appetizers are the saganaki, cold octopus salad and avgolemono. I love the avgolemono from here so much that I always eat a bowl there and take some to go. 

One of my favorite dinners I&apos;ve ever had was the swordfish skewer. It just fell off the stick and melted in my mouth. Will always come back to this place as it is truly authentic!"
4,"Got takeout and really enjoyed it. Great value and delicious flavors.

Sagnaki - 4.5/5. Unique dish. Cheese placed on bread with a bit of lemon. Simple but effective.

Spanakotiropita - 4/5. Basically spanakopita. Solidly executed."
5,Favorite Greek restaurant in the city. Been there over 30 times and it&apos;s always delicious. The leg of lamb/chopped lamb with potatoes and rice is my favorite. The lamb is so tender. Gyro appetizer is amazing too. Wine is super reasonable with most bottles just less than $30. The only thing to bring down it&apos;s rating would be the decor... it&apos;s a bit dated but quaint and not a ton of outdoor space.
5,"What an absolutely WONDERFUL place for lunch.  Delicious food, excellent service, beautiful facilities, good parking.  Tables were appropriately spaced and the servers all had personal protective equipment.  The fried zucchini and eggplant were delicious.  Lightly battered and just right.  Then we had the 
vegetarian mousaka was outstanding - rich and scrumptious.  The lunch ended with baklava was extremely sweet and provided a perfect ending to our meal.  Must return."
3,"Wanted to eat at this place for a long time.  Many reputable restaurant guides talk about it, but it was OKAY and nothing spectacular.  I think their is an overhype here because the quality of the food was not as previously suggested. 

Located in a nice neighborhood, and the vibe is great tho!"
5,"As a true Greek, i approve this place as authentic! Food tastes home made, which most of it is made fresh! Whether dining in, when you can, or take away, it&apos;s always delicious!"
3,"Was craving Greek food and have always wanted to try Greek Islands Restaurants. They have outdoor seating available along the street for the pandemic eaters. Awesome for Greek Islands to provide free valet. Just make sure to carry cash for tip as I saw a few customers not have cash on them and was not able to tip the valet drivers. 

Came on a Saturday afternoon and to sit inside there was no wait, to sit outside there was about a 10-15 minute wait. No problem. The menu is massive. Good luck being overwhelmed and figuring out what to eat. Based on the Yelp reviews, I honestly had no idea what their best go to dish was. So I went with my low culture Greek taste buds and got the Gyros plate. LOL. The gyros plate was good. The pita was tasty, the sauce was fine and the meat was good. Was it the best gyros I ever had? I don&apos;t think so. I might&apos;ve had a really good gyros at 4am after the clubs right around the corner at Mr Greeks but taste buds change being sober and not sober. We also shared the Lamb Chops. Now there&apos;s different lamb chops on the menu, and I&apos;ll be honest, just went with the cheapest option since it was a lunch time outing and didn&apos;t want to over eat for the rest of the day. Maybe not my finest choice. The lamb chops were pretty dry, and just not the best presentation you would like. I wasn&apos;t a fan which is probably the reason why this place is getting 3 stars from me. Also ordered the flaming saganaki cheese. It wasn&apos;t flaming, it was sizzling, but not really flaming. SAD! If you like salty cheese (like I do), you will like this dish. All in all, atmosphere seems great, would love to come back with a larger group and eat indoors once everything settles with the Pandemic."
5,"This restaurant is classic and so delicious. It feels less bustling than usual right now due to COVID, but they have the tables nicely spaced and also it is nice that the restrooms are single occupancy and very clean at the moment. As for the food, it is delicious. We had the vegetable moussaka, Mediterranean chicken breast, Spartan chicken, and saganaki.  Everything was delicious and came out of the kitchen quickly. Service is very fast to the point where you can at times feel rushed but they are very accommodating. Also the wine by the glass is a very generous pour for the money so I would for sure recommend that. Valet parking is also free which makes the experience much nicer as well!"
3,"I purchased some food via Grubhub and it arrived earlier than expected. The food was quite good. They would have gotten 5 stars except for the fact that something was left out of the meal. I understand that things happen but if someone pays $40 for one entree and one salad, you&apos;d think that they would check."
5,"Came here a few days ago on a nice sunny day. The staff took Covid precautions taking temperatures and tables were socially distant. They offer both inside and out. My friend and I had the gyro plate, a few glasses of wine, and a few other dishes which were all delicious. Our waiter Ariel was very friendly and accommodating."
1,Just received the smallest serving size of chicken for $15. I would not order this meal again. Hopefully in the future they&apos;ll be more generous to their customers.
5,"We celebrate all our special occasions at the Greek Islands- birthdays, graduations. With COVID we got Greek Island takeout for our daughter&apos;s birthday and it was delicious!"
5,"Ten thousand stars for this amazing Greek restaurant! Heading towards Greektown in Chicago is probably one of my favorite things to do from the multiple times i have gone to this city. The service was quick and their food was so outrageously good ! If you are craving carbs and cheese this is the place for you ! Your dinner comes with Greek bread and as an appetizer we got the flaming saganaki cheese (mixing these two was genius part of my boyfriend) I loved it so much ! I highly recommend coming here and I would love to come back and try more! This place will leave you feeling yelling OPA ! 
Highly recommend:
Saganaki cheese
Mousaka"
5,"Oh heck yessss!!! If you enjoy classic family-style Mediteranean cuisine, Greek Islands will exceed all of your foodie expectations!! It has been here since the 1970&apos;s and is loaded with unassuming charm and an extensive menu of options priced to allow for multiple dishes to be ordered without breaking the piggy bank. 

Came here with friends visiting Chicago from Europe and it managed to impress! The staff is mostly from coastal regions of Europe so its not any wonder that the recipies are authentic and well portioned.

What I love most is how the seasonings are simple so not to overpower the food. Fresh lemon over flaming cheese is my absolute favorite and what they are well-known for as an appetizer. Seriously, it will prime your tastebuds for the mains!!

Feeling overwhelmed? The waitstaff can certainly help navigate you and isn&apos;t likely to suggest the pricey items because their staple dishes like Gyros or grilled octopus are absolute musts and are crowd pleasing. Do not be afraid to take your palate outside of its comfort zone here... you may just fall in love with something you never knew existed:))

Yelp Tip: They do NOT take reservations and will not seat until all are present so best to go on the early side before hangry sets in. Also it is located in the heart of Greektown so give yourself the chance to get a pastery or an adult-coffee nearby for a true Greek-Experience without a passport in hand."
4,"My boyfriend and I dropped by Greek Islands for lunch on our last day in Chicago. We have both been to Greece and have very good Greek food where we&apos;re from, so naturally we had very high expectations and Greek Islands definitely met them! 

We decided to start off with an order of saganaki, which is grilled cheese that is set on fire tableside and then topped with lemon juice. Once the cheese is grilled, it gets a nice crust on the outside, but stays nice and gooey on the inside. I highly recommend it if you haven&apos;t tried it before. 

I ordered the homemade gyros and my boyfriend ordered the kontosouvli (pork with onions and a side of pita). Both of our meals were absolutely delicious. My gyros were perfectly seasoned, but not to the point that you couldn&apos;t taste the flavor of the meat. The tzatziki was divine and the pita was light and fluffy. Both of our meals ended up being way too much for us to eat, so we ended up leaving with lots of leftovers. 

We decided to get a slice of baklava for dessert, which ended up being the only disappointing part of the meal. They gave us a huge slice of it, but the only problem was that it was nearly impossible to cut, so we practically had to saw it with a knife. That would be forgivable if the flavor were good, but it had a very bitter note that lingered in your mouth and that I just didn&apos;t really care for. Perhaps we had a bad batch? 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Greek Islands. The food was generally very good and the service was impeccable. I would definitely go back in the future."
1,"Please forgive the previous typos. There&apos;s no excuse ...but I will still offer one. I will plead being so upset I didn&apos;t go back to proofread my work. By the way - my meal was pretty good, hard as it was to enjoy."
4,"Greek town! The interior is spacious and multi-tiered/elevated in a way that it&apos;s interesting!

Grilled Octopus --
Absolutely tender and delicious. Grilled well, seasoned well. Muah chef&apos;s kiss. 
Big portion if you get the full portion! Good to share. The rice and tomato sauce that came with was a good addition. 

Grilled cheese (saganaki)--
Oooo this one was a bit of a show to set it on fire in front of you. It was more of a novelty, cool to try but too rich to eat after a few bites. Went well with the complimentary bread."
