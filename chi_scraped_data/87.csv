5,"Dining in is still unavailable due to covid, and staff is taking ample safety measures. Enforcing masks to enter, and sanitizer is available at the door. All staff had gloves and (properly worn) masks. All tables have been removed but one, which is being used as a counter to pay. They even have two cups set up, one with clean pens, and one for used pens after customers sign their receipts.

Onto the good stuff. Oh. My. God! The food is fantastic. Only one of the three of us who went are vegan, and the other two of us in the group thoroughly enjoyed everything. My only suggestion is that by shape, size, and texture, I think the thai chili seitan wings would be better marketed as boneless ribs.

Everything was very reasonably priced and the staff was great -- which is especially appreciated in today&apos;s world. Can&apos;t wait to be back!"
5,"We drove out from the suburbs to support The Chicago Diner and get some amazing food we have been missing during the staying safe at home during covid-19. We loaded up on our favorite BBQ wings, Gyro, and the Cuban all paired with waffle fries. Of course we were super happy to get chocolate chip shakes- which we drank by the time we got home =no pics.

It was great to get to pickup at the diner since we had now way to get a delivery. We pulled up and all the orders were ready to roll. Thanks to the Chicago diner. Driving an hour each way says it all- been coming here for 20 years+ and proud to be vegetarian and get to enjoy this goodness!

Be safe.   Please wear a mask and gloves per request of the diner team."
5,"My kiddo cannot eat so was craving a shake. LS peeps recommended Chicago Diner. This place is vegan heaven. The vanilla shake was totally delicious. Frothy, thick and good. Order ahead and pick up online or order at the door and wait outside. LS is so lucky to have a place dedicated to plant free eats."
5,"No better place in Chicago to grab a veggie / vegan meal.
We ordered the - Black bean burger, Chicken Shawarma plate, Buffalo Wings, and Spinach &amp; Artichoke dip.

Always tasty and filling."
2,"TL:DR - From a meat eaters perspective, the vegan options here were all underwhelming for vegan food. The cookie dough milk shake, carrot cake, cuban, and monte cristo were all just ok. The biscuits and gravy were terrible.

--------------------------------------------------------

Been on a tour of the vegan establishments lately. I will say though that I myself am not vegan, so my review is going to be coming from that perspective. Came here based on a recommendation and was pretty disappointed. Between four of us, we got several different items. I myself got to try a cookie dough milk shake, the carrot cake, biscuits and gravy, the cuban, and the monte cristo. Everything was really underwhelming.

The cookie dough milk shake had great consistency. It was surprisingly thick which was great. But the oatmilk flavor that was mixed in tended to over power any other flavor put in. It wasn&apos;t off putting, it just wasn&apos;t that satisfying. People also talk about how large the sizes are. These are not at all large. The &quot;large&quot; shake is about the same size as a medium fountain soda at most places. The carrot cake was also disappointing. I love really rich and dense carrot cake. This was relatively dry, but the cream cheese frosting was on point. The cuban was fine but forgettable. All the meats inside just had a limp bologna texture and wasn&apos;t particularly savory or flavorful. The bread was nice? The monte cristo was probably the best item I had. The bacon was still floppy like the Cuban meats, but the sandwich worked better as a whole with the contrast between sweet and savory and the texture of the french toast and bacon/egg.

The biscuits and gravy was easily the biggest disappointment. The biscuits themselves were NOT fluffy, and were about the size of round breakfast patties (re: flat). They were so thin, I felt dumb for cutting it in half to do open faced biscuits and gravy (the only way to eat it). The gravy itself was more dense/floury than I liked. Texture of paste with a hint of salt.

Even though I&apos;m not vegan, I have had amazing vegan food. I recently found and loved &quot;I Can&apos;t Believe It&apos;s Not Meat&quot; in hyde park and am blown away on what they can do. I think my other friend said it best, Chicago diner seems to be focusing on meat substitutes (seitan, tofu, etc.) while &quot;I Can&apos;t Believe It&apos;s Not Meat&quot; seems to try and impersonate meat (impossible brand stuff)."
3,"I&apos;ve seen so many great reviews about this classic, oldest vegan establishment in Chicago, so it&apos;s an understatement to say that I&apos;m disappointed. My man and I ordered a bunch of items, none of which really stood out to us. 

Thai Chili Wings - the were seasoned pretty well but the texture was off. I like the flavor but I&apos;ve had better wing substitutes. 

Vegan Mac - I&apos;m sure the Mac and cheese was dairy-free since the entire establishment is vegan, however when I bit into the Mac, I instantly felt sick, which only happens when I have dairy; so there&apos;s that. 

Titanic BLT Burger - the burger was pretty good. In the beginning of eating the burger I really liked it. However at some point midway the taste didn&apos;t settle well with me, and I didn&apos;t have the desire to finish it. 

Country Fried Steak - My man did enjoy the country fried steak. He liked the texture and the flavor so we were happy with that! 

Waffle Fries - these were the best part and the most rewarding! They were fried perfectly and seasoned well."
5,"I had a previous review about a really ridiculous order mixup. Long story short: all I wanted was some cheesecake and it launched an adventure. 

Anyway, this place resolved it...quickly...and gave me another slice of cheesecake. 

5 stars. Thanks, Chicago Diner. 
- the enchiladas de mole were covered in dairy and what looked like bbq sauce 
- the rice and beans were fun. More beans than rice. Not shabby but I wouldn&apos;t order it.
- Portobello truffle melt with gluten free bread: huge sandwich with lots of layers. Impossible to just bite into. I kept it classy with a knife and fork. Decent until you add the sauce. Incredible sauces!! Bread was gf but like standard bread.
- cheese fries: the cheese makes it. Fries were decent and it was a nice helping of cheese sauce. I recommend.

Support local businesses. If they mess up, gently let them know and I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll rectify it and in the classiest way possible like this place did.

Very pleased."
4,"My husband and I have been on a vegan hunt lately because he&apos;s had to modify his diet. Chicago Diner is the godfather of vegan restaurants so we checked out this place on a Friday night. First off, it was super crowded which is always a good sign. We put our name down and headed to a restaurant next door to grab a snack. The wait was about 45 minutes. Seated by 9:20pm. We ordered chicken wings made out of seitan, chicken pot pie, ruben sandwich with sweet potato fries. Portions were big! The wings were nicely flavored, but the texture was weird. It didn&apos;t resemble the texture of actual chicken wings. The chicken pot pie crust was really dry. The filling was great but was overshadowed by the cry crust. The best dish of the evening was the ruben sandwich, which is also one of their specials. My husband said he&apos;d go back just for the ruben, so we&apos;ll likely be returning in the near future. 

I see the appeal, and have never experienced a place with such extensive vegan options. Overall, I&apos;m impressed. I think I just ordered the wrong things this time around, but I&apos;m open to giving it another try!"
4,"This place does GOOD vegan food, no question. 

I love a dirty plate of smothered nachos, and these were a home-run. The quinoa chili was good--the quinoa really balances out a deep smokiness in the chili that I wouldn&apos;t want to eat on it&apos;s own. The Special Recipe Wings (spicy buffalo style) were probably my least favorite of everything, but they weren&apos;t bad. It&apos;s pretty tangy and salty, with an expected spongy texture you&apos;ll find in a lot of vegan meat. However, they&apos;re still palatable and boy, the portion size is HUGE. I only ate one &quot;wing&quot; in one sitting, and could definitely see myself cutting up some chunks to throw into salad or to use as protein next to a side of rice. 

I&apos;m really interested in trying out what other vegan-ized classics they can whip up."
5,"Looking for delicious vegan food, go no further!! This restaurant has it all - sandwiches, salads, burgers, brunch, and best of all, they have delicious vegan milkshakes (which can be so difficult to find). A lot of the items can also be made gluten free which is great if that is something you&apos;re looking for. My friend and I were both extremely happy with our sandwiches (Cuban and Reuben). We also go the Spinach Artichoke Dip which is definitely hard to find vegan, and it was just like the non-vegan version. Definitely will be back here!!"
2,"This was one of my favorite vegan restaurants until this last experience. I ordered 2 titanic tilt burgers with cheesy waffle fries, 2 cinnamon rolls, a kids meal and a shake. The cinnamon rolls were okay, the shake was good, but the food was terrible. The burgers were DRY and the &quot;bacon&quot; was gummy they were probably old and over cooked. This was super disappointing and frustrating. I&apos;m working during a pandemic to treat myself but instead I wasted over $50 on trash. My waffle fries were replaced with regular fries that were old and inedible. The kids meals was bland--rice, green beans and tofu thrown together with no seasoning. We drove an hour to get to this place and it wasn&apos;t worth it. 

I can&apos;t believe I wasted my time and money on this."
1,"Very disappointed with this most recent experience. This is supposedly the vegan eggs benedict, which my partner and I have had multiple times and it looked nothing like this. We called the restaurant and the manager swore that this strange sour and dry patty was the &quot;silken tofu&quot;. It was disappointing because as a manager, there&apos;s no way this person doesn&apos;t know what&apos;s being done in their kitchen. I can only assume at this point that this person was choosing to pretend and gaslight customers rather than admitting to a very clear mistake. We didn&apos;t even ask them to remedy this mistake, but its incredibly poor customer service that they didn&apos;t bother to offer. On top of this, I ordered the breakfast bowl and the biscuits were as my grandma would call them &quot;tight&quot; - its like biting through a baseball. We didn&apos;t even end up eating this and had to order from a different restaurant instead. And trust me, we are NOT the type to waste food. We are usually happy with their food but this is the third time we&apos;ve had poor food and service. This was by far the worst."
4,"One of the OG&apos;s of the vegetarian dining movement, The Chicago Diner is a well-earned institution in the city. 

The Milwaukee Ave location fits in perfectly with the neighborhood, a casual yet fashionable spot showing movies on VHS. I will say, the layers of dust I saw on
lights and fans was slightly worrisome, but...

The food speaks the truth. So many tremendous options for the vegetarian. I would say, while the breakfast is good, it&apos;s not the star here. The sandwiches are really damn good - bring your meat-eating friends, they&apos;ll never know the difference!"
5,This place is incredible. You don&apos;t have to be vegetarian or vegan to eat here! The gyro seitan is better than any real meat gyro I&apos;ve had!
5,"Have been huge fans of The Chicago diner. Not since &apos;83, but for the past 15 or so years. Their menu is phenomenal - a vegetarian paradise!

So our favs are the Reuben, the wings (BBQ and Buffalo), and the vegan chocolate shake. But everything is good. 

We also order from here for Thanksgiving (pickup is in Boys Town). Beef Wellington is great as is the tub of faux corned beef to make your own Reuben. 

They also have a great COVID set up so that you have no contact with anyone :)"
5,"My best friend came to town and recommended eating here. I&apos;m so glad we did! The vibe is great, we were seated quickly, and served quickly. The menu has a ton of options, both vegan and vegetarian. I ordered the quesadilla which was sooo good, and my best friend a sandwich. We both got shakes, which were amazing! I will definitely be back and can&apos;t wait to try more."
5,"I have been here SO MANY TIMES and its always AMAZING. I have tried their brunch, burgers, shakes, and sandwiches and WOW they never disappoint. Their milkshakes are ON POINT and their sandwiches/burgers are always fresh and amazing. The portabello truffle melt is one of my favorites along with the Buddha&apos;s Karma Burger. I got the cinnamon roll pancake special for brunch once and it was fantastic. The only thing I didn&apos;t like that I&apos;ve tried is the smores brownie sundae - a little too dense for my liking. But everything else has been amazing and the second quarantine is over, I will be back!"
5,"In my journey to change up my eating habits for a healthier lifestyle. My wife mentioned to me a hidden vegan/vegetation eatery close to home.  

We&apos;re walked in a bit early, around 6pm. According to a friend of hers, it gets busy on the weekends. Im shays on the fence about going to a new place, waiting a long time to be seated, and then finding or the food was crappy. 

Ok, we&apos;re seated. Noise level was good.  The seating was snug, but still enjoyable. Our server was very cool. He made recommendations based on the look of confusion on our faces. I&apos;ve never heard of a vegan Gyro! How&apos;s that possible? Little did I know that we would actually be enjoying it as much as we did. 

Food service is pretty fast or at least during the time we went and the prices were decent. Check them out if your looking for a change."
5,"WOW. NOW THIS is someplace that every vegan NEEDS TO TRY at least once in their life. My friend and I split the Reuben (with vegan cheese) and the peanut butter chocolate vegan milkshake. Really spectacular. We went around 2pm on a weekday and easily got a seat, but I&apos;ve heard that it gets crowded on weekends. There are tons of options for vegans/vegetarians... I guarantee that everyone will leave satisfied (even omnivores). Plus the milkshakes are incredible. Best vegan shake I&apos;ve ever tried. Great for a meatless diner... AND A REGULAR DINER."
5,"Walking in, you think you are in a typical diner. The Chicago Diner is so much more! Absolutely mouthwatering, delicious food that is .... dare I say it? VEGAN! My best friend took me there after reading about it online. Boy am I glad that she did! This place is a vegan&apos;s dream! I am not Vegan and was suprised on how delicious the food was. I am a meat eating carnivore who is focused on high protein, low carb meals and the deliciousness of this place completely overwhelmed me. I&apos;ll be back Chicago Diner, I&apos;ll be back!"
