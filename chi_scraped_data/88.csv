5,"Great Price and quality! 
My go to is filet mignon (2 pieces) with green mashed potatoes and blood sausage.
Comes with salad and amazing gravy. 
Im very happy that this business is still operating and I would like it to stay that way. i will order soon for pickup because i want to make sure it stays in business. Tough times"
5,"What is there to say that hasn&apos;t already been said?? Tango Sur is absolutely worth the wait. I actually don&apos;t eat any red meat, but I adore this steakhouse. While everyone gapes over their massive servings of filet or perfectly cooked t-bone, I am in chimichurri chicken heaven, all but licking my plate to get every drop of the oily green sauce and juicy Pechuga de Pollo. Oh, and the empanadas are to die for, my absolute favorite in the city. I recommend the chicken, corn, and spinach &amp; cheese. While I personally haven&apos;t tried any of them (yet), there are always many different vegetarian options that look and smell just as heavenly as the meat, so everyone is sure to find something here.

The outdoor dining this summer was awesome and totally covid-safe, and still BYOB, but takeout is just as delicious."
4,"Ordered take out for Valentine&apos;s Day dinner because this place had so many great reviews. We ordered beef and chicken empanadas, Churrasco dinner, and Costeleta dinner. The beef empanada I personally loved more than the chicken empanada. They also provide you with small loaves of bread which was amazingly soft! My churrasco dinner was extremely delicious and loved the vesuvio potatoes on the side. The Costeleta was a bone in rib eye and my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed it with the chimichurri sauce. All of the portion sides were generous and all for a grey price. Everything cost about $72 and overall really loved the authenticity of the food!"
5,"Absolutely enjoyed my first dining experience at Tango Sur! What can I say the place was fantastic encompassing the ambiance, excellent food and at a great value. Was recommended to this restaurant by a culinary expert and didn&apos;t hesitate to try it out. I was quite surprised and very happy!  

We started out with some appetizers which consisted of empenadas and some chorizo/blood sausage. They also included dinner rolls, salad, sauces and butter which was excellent. The place allow you to bring your own wine beverages or even cognac from what I saw at another table! The meat was excellent and large portion. I personally had the filet and rib-eye. For dessert the flan with caramel was to die for! 

Overall FANTASTIC experience and great to come back to eating at restaurants after a much long delay from last year. Kudos to the chef and the excellent restaurant. Will absolutely return."
5,"This was my very first time at Tango Sur and it definitely won&apos;t be my last. I meet a friend here for lunch and we decided to sit outside. I was able to find parking right in front so that&apos;s always a plus. Our Server was very nice and attentive. They also have BYOB which is pretty cool.

OK now for the food...I read all the other reviews and everyone spoke so highly of the El filet so it was only right I gave it a try as well. It was two filet mignon cooked perfectly medium and side of spinach mashed potatoes. This was the best combination dish I&apos;ve ever had.  The filet was cooked on the grill topped with red onion wine sauce. It had so much flavor very juicy and just amazing. It&apos;s definitely on my list of places to go to in Lakeview. Can&apos;t wait to come back soon!"
2,"We came Sunday lunch. Service was great and we made reservations band were seated right away. They lit the candle and the outdoor seating looked beautiful.

However the food was subpar. We got the el filet at medium and ended up with raw middle on both pieces. The lomo was supposed to be well done and still had blood oozing out. Also didn&apos;t care for the flavor is of lomo. 
The only good we actually enjoyed was the spinach mash potatoes. The empanada only the spinach and cheese was good, both the chicken and beef was bland. 

Personally was looking forward to a good restaurant, however very disappointed in the food and serving uncooked meat."
5,Cute dinner date spot. Dark and romantic atmosphere. The food is delicious and the steak is cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend and come back next time I&apos;m in town. It is also BYOB which made it a lot more fun for our group.
5,"I have been to Tango Sur many times, and I can&apos;t believe this, but I have now been dining there for two decades!  (I was so fortunate to get in a dinner yesterday during a 24 hour pass through Chicago, but used to go there all the time when I lived in Chicago.)

I cannot believe how consistent it has been all these years.  As always, I walked in with wine and beer, since they are BYOB, and, even thought I haven&apos;t been there in at least 5 years, ordered without even looking at the menu.  (The hot berenjena dish, entrana, and later, flan!)

That eggplant dish was as good as ever.  Particularly it seemed like the ingredients were super fresh.  The steak was cooked to perfection--when I asked for rare, the waiter said they recommend medium rare, but would do it a little less than that, which ended up being perfect.

There were potentially two changes: they dressed the salad, which my friend said was probably because of the pandemic...they don&apos;t want you sharing olive oil and vinegar.  And I don&apos;t remember potatoes coming with the steak, which were very nice.  Chimichuri is still as good as anyone&apos;s, not that the steak needs it, and I&apos;ve never had better flan.

It&apos;s incredible in this day and age to go to a great restaurant includes a salad and bread and butter with your meal, which is a good example of how nice their hospitality is.  All around the staff is awesome.

Can&apos;t imagine I&apos;ll go so many years beforfe my next visit."
4,"We were looking for a place to have dinner with The Doctor&apos;s cousins that was BYOB, had meat and we could get into for an early dinner since the cousins had to gt up early to drive to Michigan.

The place ticked all of the boxes.  This is another one of those places that I have passed a million times but never noticed.  Well on Jan 31st, 2020, Tango Sur got my attention.  

We didn&apos;t have a reservation because they don&apos;t do them for parties less than six, but there were nice enough to take my name to put it on a wait list.  However when The Doctor and I arrived, Rob was already there and sitting at the table, so that was great to know we didn&apos;t have to wait.  The main dining room is small and intimate; there is another space off from the main room, but couldn&apos;t see how big it was.

Our server was on top of things, bringing out bread and glasses for the wine, bubbles and beer we brought.  He gave us some time to look over the menu and answer questions about some of the cuts/preparation of the meats.

We started off with empanadas: beef, chicken, &amp; spinach &amp; cheese.  The pastry used for the empanadas was excellent, nice and flaky, not dry at all.  The beef and chicken were very good with the chimichurri sauce.  The spinach &amp; cheese was okay, just didn&apos;t seem to have that much flavor.  Could have used a little salt as it was on the bland side as far as taste.

Joan got this amazing salad...don&apos;t remember the name of it as it was on a separate menu, but it was huge and amazing!  It was big enough for 2-3 to eat off of and loaded with seafood (octopus, calamari, etc).  It was just loaded to the gills with seafood.  This could have been a meal all on its own.

I wish I had taken a photo of the menu we ordered from as we were so busy talking and laughing that I did not pay attention like I normally do for reviews.  My entree was a huge piece of steak stuffed with cheese and spinach, served with vesuvio potatoes.  The steak was cooked to perfection...again, perfection!  The cheese and spinach in the middle was delightful, with it just oozing out so wonderfully delicious.  Everyone got meat and I can&apos;t tell you what the got because I was all into my meat.  The Doctor got something with mashed potatoes that was medium rare and lovely, no idea what it was called, but it was good.   All I am going to say is we all got me and that meat was goooooood!  Me, The Doctor and Joan ended up taking half our meat home with us.  Gotta say The Doctor said his was great as he ate his while watching the Super Bowl.

We opted for dessert....asked for the dessert menu, we got a dessert tray instead.  Love it!  Me and Rob got the coconut leche cake and The Doctor got something that looked like red velvet.  The cake was ok, a little on the dry side for me and Rob, but not bad.  I love coconut, so I was okay with it.  It was cold...next time I would ask to have it warmed in the microwave if I get this again.  I am not a fan of cold cake, The Doctor and The Queen loves cold cake.

The only downside to the meal was the bread for all of us.  The presentation looked amazing, but it didn&apos;t live up to the hype.  It was super crispy with not much flavor, so we passed on it.  Which was a good thing as we did not fill up on bread like we normally do.  So it was a blessing in disguise.

The service was great and I didn&apos;t feel like we were being rushed, even though people started showing up left and right for dinner.  Tango Sur might have missed the mark on the bread, but man they know how to rock a piece of meat.  And being BYOB makes it all the more enticing for an enjoyable night out for a big ole slab of deliciously prepared meat."
5,"Love love love Tango Sur. A BYOB Aregentinian steakhouse!?!?!! Whaaaaaatt??!?!! We sat on the patio for brunch/lunch one weekend day (Covid) and everything was awesome. The steak...my god the steak... The chimmichurri was out of this world, the potatoes were amazing, the service was great. AND the patio is dog friendly! I&apos;m not 100% sure what they&apos;re doing for the winter season, but if they are open on the patio in tents or whatever they have going on - PLEASE GO SUPPORT THEM. They need it now more than ever and this is a STAPLE on the north side. We cannot let them die."
5,This place is amazing. It is Argentinian food with a twist. I got the two filets and they came with a delicious spinach mash potatoes. They also give you a huge bread basket and comp salad! Everything was so delicious and it is also BYOB with NO corking fee. This is why I love this place. What you see is what you get. They also have a great outdoor space. I loved this place.
1,"So usually I&apos;m always very pleased when I come here, however as my partner and I are currently living in separate states we decided to celebrate valentines day the week after. I called as soon as the establishment opened to make reservations, i was told that the restaurant did NOT do reservations. Walk-ins only. So my partner and I decided to go early to have our dinner. We were told to make reservations repeatedly at the door and that walk-ins were not something we should do during the weekend. I was beyond furious, and hour and half wait?! NO WAY &amp; may i add this will be the last time i spend my money here or recommend anyone to this establishment."
5,Bring your own wine. Good steak and nice ambience. I can&apos;t wait to visit TS after my Covid vaccine. Really miss your food and place.
4,The food is fantastic! It&apos;s very very dark in the restaurant but it sets a romantic vibe with a candle lit dinner. The service is good. This place is a BYOB.
5,"First time at Tango Sur. Always wanted to try this place but don&apos;t have patience to wait for a table. Ordered pickup on Saturday for a special bday meal and it was fantastic!!!
- Costeleta: ribeye with white wine garlic sauce and mashed potato - I loved the sauce and the steak was cooked well to medium 
- Vacio relleno: Flab steak stuffed with chimicurri sauce and sweet potato - super flavorful with a lot of herbs
- El Filet: 2 filet mignon with red white sauce and spinach mash potatoes - filet was cooked to perfect medium. We were very pleasantly surprised with how well the steak was cooked. Mash potato was very tasty
- Beef and chicken empanadas: it was good, but I&apos;m not a super fan of empanadas in general

Everything was steaming hot when it got home (and the restaurant is not super close to us). They also included dinner rolls, salad, sauces and butter. Some restaurants skip things like free bread when you order pickup,  so this is very much appreciated.

All in all, best pickup/delivery meal ever, and one of the best meals I&apos;ve had in Chicago."
5,"You don&apos;t think take-out steak will be good, but when it comes from Tango Sur, it will be cooked to perfection, juicy and flavorful. We go the El Filet and we bathed the meat in the sauce. The empanadas burst with flavor and the chimichurri, whereas I usually find it too oily, was herbaceous and garlicky. We had the dulce de leche cheesecake for dessert and I wish I could buy a jar of just the sauce."
5,"Went to see a movie at the music box and decided to grab dinner here afterward. 
We weren&apos;t expecting anything special, but WOW. This place is amazing. Service is top notch and the filet mignon is probably the best steak I&apos;ve ever had at a restaurant. 
The best part about it though is the ambience. It&apos;s really dark and the only light at our table was candlelight. Very intimate and delightful. Really all about the conversation and the food here. 

We&apos;ll be back :)"
1,"They were offering INDOOR dining on New Year&apos;s Eve. I saw it when I picked up my carry out dinner. Maybe 8-10 tables at least. I know this is a hard time for businesses but they are violating public health guidelines which means they are putting their customers and employees at risk. 

345,000 PEOPLE ARE DEAD. Actions like this put our healthcare workers and society at large at risk. Gross."
3,"This is a great spot for low lit candle seating and the vibes are immaculate. Great food. Three stars for the following reason. Your 8:15 reservation is useless, even though they&apos;ll tell you you will have a table. I made a reservation for indoor seating for my birthday at 8:15. We rushed and made sure to make it in on time, when we got there, no table for us. Had to wait until 8:50 to be sat inside for a reservation I made the day before. Once we were sat, about three more tables opened. So basically make a reservation (or just get there) before 6 or 7 to get a table inside and ride it out. The dinner rush will clear out around 9pm and then you can just go in and get a table then as well. I hate that they promised me a table at 8:15 when I just could have come in two hours earlier and got sat right away. Really put a damper on my birthday. Lame."
3,"Excellent food for a great price, but the service is a hit or miss.
We recently had a bad experience with a waiter, charging us a $8 sharing fee despite of us ordering 2 entrées (we were a party of 2)
He claimed that he explained it to us beforehand why that is, but neither my wife nor myself recalled that.
Will avoid dining in from now on and order takeout instead."
