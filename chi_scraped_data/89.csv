5,"Went here with a friend during Covid. Their outdoor and minimal indoor seating is open due to their large windows that can be open fully. 

My friend and I sat outside with a heated lamp near us. It was just enough warmth to keep us going through the meal, which by the way, was fantastic!

We ordered a few appetizers and both got the Spicy Ramen. It was soooo good. Spicy but not too spicy. The broth was fantastic as well as the chicken in it. Portions were huge and got to take my leftovers home. Loved everything about this place! Highly recommend!"
5,"I had an appointment downtown and it was cold out!  I&apos;ve been meaning to try this place for quite some time.  Eating out during Covid times are quite different.  Ramen SAN take no chances.  The place was immaculate and they take your temperature at the entrance.  The social distancing tables are far enough apart and quite safe.  The staff wears masks and gloves and there&apos;s sanitizer there for you.  

As for the food, I tried the chicken and vegetable Gyoza and the Imperial Shio.  The food came out quickly and super hot.  Everything tasted so nice and looked so clean.  

My experience was very positive even during these tough times."
5,"I&apos;m a pretty hard critique of Japanese ramen and to be honest, the ramen wasn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve had but I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience here. The outdoor seating has a partially covered hut and heated lamps overhead the raised tables. Your legs will get chilly so I suggest bringing a blanket or scarf to wrap around your legs to stay warm if dining outside in the winter. Our waiter and staff were very efficient and polite - they visited often but not an annoying amount.  

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the katsu tonkatsu (limited edition). Despite the weather being cold outside, our ramen came out very hot and stayed relatively hot until we finished our bowls. I believe the chasu in the tonkatsu was smoked - which was new to me. It surprisingly worked! It didn&apos;t look like a large quantity of meat but it was VERY dense. It filled me up pretty quickly. My ramen had too many bamboo shoots and wakame. I wish there was something light like mung bean sprouts to balance the heaviness and add some texture. The fried garlic was a GREAT addition  though - compliments to the chef on that one. 

The katsu tonkatsu had katsu sauce (like a sweet Japanese worchestire) and mustard wasabi. It significantly impacts the taste of the broth. It wasn&apos;t my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Giving this a 5 star because we were treated very well and had an overall good experience. Plus the many cute river north puppies walking by and saying hello put us in an especially good mood. 

Ramen-San is part of lettuce entertain you so make sure you have the app and collect points for dining in!"
3,"Ramen-san is a cute little ramen shop within downtown of Chicago. My friends and I were craving ramen so we ended up making lunch reservations after our shopping trip. 

When we arrived, we were greeted right away. Due to COVID, they took our temps at the host desk prior to seating us. We were also notified that they do not hand out menus but have a QR Code for an electronic menu - this was amazing!

My friends had the typical Ton katsu ramen. I ended up ordering the miso ramen for it&apos;s spice. The restaurant was not busy and we were the only customers for the first 15 minutes. However, we noticed there were some miscommunication between waitresses. Our waitress took our drink orders and another would come along and ask to take our drinks orders. Same when it came to ordering our food. There were only 2 other parties in the restaurant and some how our table was getting serviced the most. No complaints but it got a little uncomfortable having to tell the second waiter that we&apos;ve been serviced. 

Overall, the food was ok since mine was great and my friends didn&apos;t really like their orders! I loved the miso ramen and I must say, it&apos;s the best I&apos;ve ever had. The Ton Katsu ramen was a bit bland so my friends didn&apos;t enjoy their ramen as much as I did and regret not listening to my recommendation lol"
2,"I try to order from local spots 1-2x/week during the pandemic to support local businesses. It&apos;s a cold evening so ramen sounded good and I haven&apos;t ordered from Ramen-San yet. 

I ordered via Uber Eats for delivery because it was a little too far for pick up. It estimated 65-85 minutes which was okay and I can understand given it&apos;s a weekend evening. 

But it took over 2 hours to get my food. I watched the tracker and it was clear that the delay was due to the restaurant, not Uber. When I got it, it was ice cold. The fried chicken was soft and appeared to have been sitting for a long time - way longer than the 20 minutes from pick up to my door. Also, there were no utensils! What kind of ramen place doesn&apos;t give chop sticks with an order?!

The food was okay tasting - no better than other places I&apos;ve tried in the city. At the beginning of the pandemic I gave restaurants a lot of grace because of the pivots that most needed to make. But we are a year into this and an efficient delivery process should be in place so food isn&apos;t ice cold and basic utensils are given. With all the great food places in Chicago, probably won&apos;t come back."
4,"I wasn&apos;t sure what I was expecting from this place. I&apos;ve had Lettuce Entertain You Ramen before from Tokio Pub so I was expecting roughly the same. I was thankfully incorrect as this food rocks (yes, I still love you Tokio Pub). 

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. My mom got a Yuzu Margarita. My dad got the Aschi beer and I had an Old Fashioned. All of our drinks were awesome, but special shout-out to my dads beer. I tried it and I was the real star. 

For appetizers, we got a little bit of everything. We were not sure on the fried chicken bun, but that was a huge surprise. It was crispy and had a nice spice. We also got the pork dumplings and chicken dumplings. The chicken dumplings were good, but the pork dumplings were really great! We finished the appetizers with the spicy Szechuan wings. It was a spice that was dry and snuck up on you. Still delicious! 

For our main course, we had the special crispy bacon ramen. It&apos;s around until the end of the month, but RUN to eat it. It was outstanding. It was so tasty! It was also huge! I got it with the Chili inside which gave a nice heat to it. The ramen already had a bit of a peppery kick so the chili might not have been needed. 

We finished up with a dessert of doughnuts with a Carmel vanilla dipping sauce. Heavenly! 

The only downside of the dinner was the environment. This is NOT a place for kids or families. I know that there are a lot of places like that, but not in LEYE. The seating was a bit restrictive and the music they play has quite a bit of swearing. I was there with my parents and felt a little weird, but It would be my scene with my friends! Our server was also fantastic so that&apos;s a big plus. 

In closing! I was floored by the quality of food at this place. I&apos;ll for sure be back, but with friends, not family :)"
4,"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. The ramen noodles had so much body, but were so light at the same time, the broth was flavorful, and the pork belly was a true star of the show. The flavor was out of this word and melts in your mouth. The ramen was priced well for both quality and quantity, however the pork buns were very kind of expensive. 1 bun for $5 is steep for something that you can eat in 2-3 bites.

The gentleman that helped with my order was kind, but there was a lady who was running orders who was really rude. My friend and I sat at a table and she got mad. There was no &quot;reserved&quot; sign, and nobody said anything about how carry out worked. She was not pleasant at all. 

If you&apos;ve got a ramen craving (or even if you&apos;re not) this place will hit the spot. It&apos;s the perfect meal for lunch or dinner and carry out orders have great instructions on how to heat and handle them to get the best experience."
4,"Walked in on the whim for lunch on a early Sunday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. My bf and I both ordered the express lunch for $15.95, which included a ramen, a fried rice, a small salad and pickled cucumbers. Each item was a nicely sized portion and the food hit the spot. I&apos;d definitely recommend the express lunch route if it&apos;s available.

Service overall was attentive and friendly, but one person felt slightly pushy and should maybe reconsider his wording when asking us if we&apos;d like to try some Japanese whiskey instead of the &quot;well whiskey&quot; we originally ordered. The recommendation the first time around was fine, but his second attempt sounded pretty snarky and condescending. I&apos;m going to assume that wasn&apos;t his intention, but it def didn&apos;t encourage us to order more drinks."
3,"@BJH.  Thank you for the follow up.  When I&apos;m in Chicago next I will check in with you to see if the comments I made here have been resolved and will update this review. Thank you for taking the time to address my comments.  

A nice filling meal.  Chicago is not up there yet when it comes to Japanese restos. Los Angeles reigns supreme on Japanese food options on the mainland.  Still I&apos;m glad that Ramen-San exists albeit owned by Lettuce and not a Japan entity. 

First I had the vegan broth ramen.  It was good, the broth tepid, the tofu still cold in the middle.  

On a second visit I had the express lunch option with salmon over rice and small kimchee ramen with a &quot;molten&quot; egg. The broth was good, the &quot;molten&quot; egg was perfect but I only got a half an egg.  The salmon was bathed in sugary sweet sauce that was off putting.  It didn&apos;t go well with the kimchee ramen as next to it, I felt I was eating dessert over steamed rice. 

Loved the service, the outdoor eating options and the coo coo Captain America mugs."
4,"When we visited, there was only outside dining due to CoVid regulations, and you had to make a reservation because there was a limited number of tables. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and even thought to ask us about any allergies. My husband has a shellfish allergy, so she was able to steer him in the correct direction regarding the ramen he should eat. 

I chose the fried chicken kimchi ramen which was delicious. I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it wasn&apos;t it, and it was really good. If you order any of the ramen entrees, make sure you are hungry, because all of them are enough for two meals. As a group, we shared the Berkshire dumplings and the Mantou Bun with Pork Belly. Both dishes were delicious, but the bun was amazing and almost enough food for a meal.

If you are interested in cocktails, I recommend the Pencillian #2."
5,"Just went back there again simply because I Love It !! The food is great , but more importantly I love the service - in these unsettling times this staff makes it feel real normal ! thanks !!!!!"
4,"Chicago literally has the best food! The last time I came to Chicago I went to their sister restaurant sushi San which has amazing food. I love a great Ramen!
Due to Covid and the new mandate we had to sit outside, but luckily they had heating lamps and it was a very sunny day.

The Ramen had thick pork pieces that were so tender and juicy. The broth was so delicious, I wish I could eat about 3 bowls of it... lol. 

Ramen san definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Chicago"
3,"Honestly I was super excited to go here because everyone raves about it. But I was kinda disappointed. It tastes like any other ramen that I&apos;ve had and seems like I could get it anywhere. Wasn&apos;t bad at all I definitely enjoyed it, but I didn&apos;t  think there was anything special about it."
1,"Server was more concerned about us wearing masks than getting the order right. They completely messed up our order. Also, the seats are extremely uncomfortable wooden benches meant for little kids. Never going here again."
2,I&apos;ll be honest definitely not a place I wish to return too. It has booths on side against wall and high picnic tables in middle. Upon entering the screen us and took her temperature for the Covid screening. They put three glasses on our table and returned probably after five minutes. They gave us water with no ice. We ordered our food. XOXO shrimp and pork I did not like but my friends did. But it&apos;s just a matter of preference. The kimchi Ramen was very good. Tonkotsu was also good. Portions were all great size. One thing we did notice was on the refrigerator there was an American flag sticker on there that was upside down. This is uncalled for. Had I seen seen it before I ordered I would not ate here.  Service was slow. No chopsticks or napkins were given to me. When you look at their menu there is a notice on the very bottom that says 5% of your bill will go towards Covid relief and it is automatically charged to your bill unless you catch it. I have no issues about helping people out but I don&apos;t wanna be forced to do it. I feel like we should be askedWe ask that it be removed in the waiter was not happy and when he returned he slammed our bills on the table. I will never return. The music playing is not conducive to eating in an ambience setting.
2,"Hate to do this. Excellent packaging, good enough service, no heating outside, and mediocre ramen. 

Try another spot or make instant."
4,"My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a little couples vacation. After a night of drinking way to much Hennessy we decided to go for ramen for lunch since it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve had good ramen. On the Midwest anyway.... Jinya will always be my home favorite in Burbank CA. 
Anyway! The food!! It was so mouth watering I couldn&apos;t believe it. At first I thought it was weird and wasn&apos;t sure if I even wanted to order the kimchi and fried chicken. After reading the great reviews I had to try it. The place was cozy and welcoming the lighting was dim the employees in the front were so helpful to. The parking is shit so definitely DO NOT park across the street we seen a girl get towed because sometimes they don&apos;t allow it. We parked right in front per the waiter the safest place to park. 
We sat down and our waiter seemed like he just wanted us to rush ... weird. It got weirder. We literally had about 3-4 waiters/waitresses; didn&apos;t seem like they communicated that well with each other it was kind of all over the place. They rarely checked on us we had to flag them down. We ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and Sumo Ramen my boyfriend loved his until he tried mine and was like I&apos;m deff ordering that next time! We also had a house salad ... not that great loved how fresh the greens were the ginger dressing just seemed a bit off. We also had the sticky Thai chicken wings which were super delicious if you order them make sure you use your towelette after your hands get super sticky! Overall I loved the food didn&apos;t care for the customer service still tipped super well because hands down the ramen was SOOO good. The music is also super annoying we went about 1Pm on a Tuesday and the music was blasting as if I was in a house party. I&apos;m 28 not a old lady LOL not  exaggerating just was pretty annoying that me and my boyfriend were struggling the entire time for a conversation because we couldn&apos;t hear each other. 
Deff a must try! Get the kimchi fried chicken ramen you won&apos;t be disappointed!!"
4,My husband insisted on trying this spot after a recommendation from friends.  They did not steer us wrong. We tried a fried chicken bowl &amp; a miso bowl with an egg.  Extra noodles are a must my friends!  The broth....wow. Such depth that elevated the toppings. Will definitely try again in the future.
4,Pretty good place. Service was spot on. Server was kind and friendly. Food was tasty and serving size was appropriate. Nothing really beats a steaming hot bowl of ramen on a freezing night. Also got the miso Brussels sprouts but found them a touch too salty but still good. Will come back to try more.
4,"Took Ramen-San to go on a rainy night for some comfort food. Super easy to pick up and the ramen toppings were packaged separately from the broth so sogginess was not an issue. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, the Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen, and the sticky Thai chicken wings. The Tonkatsu was overall really delicious and the broth was on point. I&apos;d definitely order this a second time! The Kimchi Fried Chicken ramen broth was nice and spicy, the chicken pieces were large, but the noodles were a little crusty. I would describe the ramen dishes as mainstream, but they still keep most of the traditional elements of an authentic ramen bowl."
