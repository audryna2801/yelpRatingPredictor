4,"It was the first day that Chicago officially allowed indoor dining, under COVID-19 restrictions. 

This is a review of two MingHin locations 

During the early afternoon, we had dim sum at MingHin- Streeterville location, followed by MingHin- Chinatown location.  

Both locations were readily prepared and welcoming for customers... from the delicious, piping hot dishes and chilled desserts,  to being appropriately staffed. Service was good. 

4 person max per table.   
Tables are respectful to social distancing at the Streeterville location. 
In the Chinatown location, there are plexiglass between all the booths.  

Streeterville location has a parking lot next to it.  Fees applicable.  
It was easy to find parking in Chinatown.  Meter fees. 

The manager at Streeterville, Mr Tony, is excellent.  
Very conscientious and ensuring your visit is at its best!  
I know overheard him (at another table) explaining and recommending dishes most suitable for their tastes and vegetarian options."
5,"Was good ate outside it was fast , food came out hot n fresh. First time coming here , I frequent the one in rolling meadows . The service here is really good along with there food. Our guest wasn&apos;t a seafood eater and our server brought us shrimp rolls and she thought they were egg rolls and went into anaphylactic shock. Oh hold up I was kidding she liked them because they are delicious.  They have taro root puff which is one of my favorites. They discontinued in RM. . It came out piping hot with a fried coating taro root and ground pork begging to be dipped in vinegar and hot sauce. 
It was really well run eating outdoors in the winter but surprisingly warm. 
Oh man now I want to go there. The one by me is only offering carry out."
5,"I&apos;ve always seen this spot &amp; never got to try it until now. It was snow/raining out and they had outside covered patio. It&apos;s a bit chilly, but there&apos;s heaters around, just know to wear a long sleeve, just in case. Service was good &amp; food came quickly. They came to check on our tea quite often, so we were never out. That helped warmed us up.

The dimsum was really good. Everything we got was good &amp; fresh. My favorites are the shrimp dumplings, meat filled balls, taro, soup. We also got food from the regular menu, tried the Beijing duck, which was good, veggie dish, &amp; pork belly. Overall was impressed &amp; will definitely visit again. The price is higher than the other places but definitely worth it."
4,"The food here is delicious, but it&apos;s not as good as their location in the Loop on Benton, but it is still very good. I would hard pass on anything that has breading because it varies on whether or not they give you too much breading and not enough meat, but overall their food is cooked perfectly and tastes above standard. 

My favorite is anything on the menu with duck! :) 
The BBQ duck and udon noodle w/black pepper sauce is the best thing ever. The crab rangoon received excellent reviews from my guests. General Tao&apos;s and Kun Pao Chicken were nicely prepared and seasoned with excellence! Lastly, I cannot leave out the salt and pepper squid, because it was an excellent appetizer. This is definitely my go-to place for dinner parties, but shhhh it&apos;s a secret don&apos;t tell anyone."
5,"I LOVED MingHin! Sadly I don&apos;t live in Chicago but luckily a family member does and this is a place I&apos;ll be eating at every time I visit. Generous portions, delicious dim sum and amazing service! 

There wasn&apos;t a single dish we didn&apos;t like- we over ordered for 2 people but the food was still great as leftovers. My favorite would be the egg tofu with snow pea tips- the tofu was so flavorful and soft. The jumbo sesame ball came in second- if you like chewy foods you&apos;ll really enjoy the texture. I honestly don&apos;t have any negative things to say about any of the other dishes...the restaurant is located in the newer part of Chinatown and it&apos;s an easy commute. Whether you&apos;re visiting or you live here, please give it a try!"
5,"Very nice and welcoming staff. Great service too.
They have heaters for outdoor seating.  

We were welcomed with green tea.

Then, We ordered grilled chickens and grilled lamb sati. Both were very delicious .  My favorite was the lamb bcz it was very juicy. 

We also ordered beef ribs for appetizers. It was tender and unique. The portion was good for sharing as well.

 For main course, we ordered orange beef , fried rice and vegetables noodles. The orange beef was crunchy, tender and tastes just right! Both of fried rice and noodles were perfect too with great portions.

Finally we ordered Mango pudding for dessert. It wasn&apos;t my favorite but it is good if you don&apos;t like very sweet food.

Prices were reasonable for two.

Definitely,i will come here again"
4,I gave this place a 4 star rating because of their delicious selections of dim sum and above average service. Their non-dim sum foods are okay. I tried several dishes such as hot and sour soup and steamed oyster and they were okay. Their service is above average. The only one  thing I didn&apos;t like about the service was the waiter wore his mask incorrectly-his mask did not cover his nose.
2,"First time visiting, not sure what the experience was like pre-COVID, but we were seated outside which was actually fun and unique. What wasn&apos;t fun was how dismissive and hasty the waiters were, quick to walk away in the middle of us asking questions. We were seated far from the other guests so maybe the distance they had to travel to us made it easy to forget us, but after asking for our check the waiter walked away without comment for ___ minutes. We both got the beef hot pot casserole, but they were bland and definitely not like any hot pot dish we&apos;ve eaten before. Overall, I&apos;m thinking it 
may be better in a less hectic time, but for now not really impressed."
4,"This spot was a little hard to find since the address we found from YELP gave us walking directions from the CTA to the restaurants kitchen in the back. Be aware that you&apos;ll have to walk around to the opposite side. Check in with the host at the podium to get a table or just walk inside if you&apos;re picking up an order. 

We visited on Saturday afternoon for lunch and this was a great spot for some dimsum! Outdoor seating was definitely not 6 feet apart so we opted for indoor seating and surprisingly they did a great job with the arrangement of the restaurant. They blocked off every other table to ensure social distancing. 

The host sat us down with laminated menus and also 2 iPads which we were quite confused about since it was our first time here. We thought the host or our server would let us know, but they didn&apos;t. There was no pen or pencil for us to write down what we wanted on the menu so we thought we had to go on the iPad and add everything we wanted to our cart. I ended up flagging another server down and asked do we order. Luckily he was nice enough to give us a pencil and to tell us instead of telling our server to come over to speak to us. We were a bit shocked and no use to the norm in Chicago because in Boston employees normally push around a cart filled with dishes for you to order from for dimsum. 

Once we ordered the food came out relatively fast, however one at a time. We ordered about 11 dishes which consisted of dimsum and noodles from their ipad which had a full menu along with a sapporo and watermelon freeze.

-sapporo- $4.00
-watermelon freeze- $4.25
-crab ragoons- $5.50--These were okay, not much flavor
-stir fried beef rice noodles- $11.50--really good but be aware there is a lot of oil
-siu mai- $4.35-- good and came with 5 
-spare ribs black bean sauce- $4.35--I really enjoyed these but others at my table did not
-chicken feet- $4.35-- tasty and flavorful 
-pan fried pot stickers- $4.35--NOPE I would not recommend 
-deep fried sesame balls- $3.75-- NOPE this was gross and the filling inside was super firm and the filling of each ball was different
-pan fried green chive cake- $4.35-- eh not the best
-rice crepe fried donut- $4.35-- really good and the donut was still crunchy
-beef crepe- $4.35-- basic
-b sprout soy sc cm- &quot;see you vong chow fan&quot;-pingyin in Cantonese- $7.95-- really good and tasty

Overall this is a great place for a quick bite to eat in Chinatown. The quality of their food was good. We ordered a lot and majority of what we order was pretty good and we would order again minus a couple items. Definitely recommend sitting inside if you want to still social distance since sitting outside didn&apos;t allow much of that. This is in the perfect location. Walk it off by simply walking the strip and getting boba or a tea at a near by shop!"
5,"MingHin offers hands down the best dim sum in Chicago!

Order pretty much anything you want and it will be fantastic!  We were lucky to grab an outdoor seat on a beautiful summer day, so we felt comfortably separated from other tables.  Prompt service and all of our items came out quickly and were hot and fresh and incredibly delish!

There are plenty of gluten-free options, but all of their buns, pastries, and puffs are off-limits if you have the restricted diet that I have.  With so many flavor-packed items to choose from, it should still be easy to find plenty of safe items to thoroughly enjoy!

*****FIVE STARS*****"
4,"On our way home to Michigan, stopped by Chinatown to have lunch.  After searching for a place, we opted to try this place.

We parked, had to wait few minutes to be seated.  There was longer wait to go inside, we asked for first table that becomes available, which meant that we got the outside table.  It was fine, it wasn&apos;t too hot and thankfully there was a breeze.

We ordered the following item:

- Pan Fried green and chive cake (shrimp and chive)
- Sticky Rice*
- Crispy Pork Belly Macau Style*
- Shrimp Crepe
- Short Ribs
- Pork Rice Noodle roll with XO Sauce*
- Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce
- Salt and Pepper Shrimp

Yeah, lot of food for two people.... ate a lot, but ended up taking leftovers.  

Our favorites are the ones with * after each item.  Our top choice was the Pork Rice Noodles with XO sauce - could eat this all day long!  Highly recommended.  Then, we would also recommend that you get Crispy Pork Belly (watch your teeth) and Sticky rice.

Their Chinese broccoli was decent, the shrimp crepe was just ok and the salt and pepper shrimp was decent. 

COVID-19 - tables are separated to meet the six feet requirements, workers all wear masks and gloves."
5,"If you have read my reviews, you should know by now how freaking picky I am and how particular I am regarding different types of cuisines. However.... 
This Chinese restaurant changed all my previous expectations AND standards of Chinese food. O M G. This was the best Chinese food I have ever had in my life so far.
We ordered a bunch of food;
Orange chicken, sesame chicken, udon noddles with chicken, pot stickers, beef with American broccoli, fried rice with shrimp. Guys..... it was so amazing. The tastes, the consistencies, the quality of the meats, the juiciness and crunchiness of all the ingredients were so perfect that gave me such a wholesome feeling. 
It was so good that I will be ordering food from MingHin one more time during my stay in Chicago. 

Please come here, sit down, enjoy a nice cup of heat green tea and stuff your face with the best Chinese food in town. Trust me."
5,"Very good food.. Everyone from our group enjoyed the food .. If we ever do a banquet style celebration. Someday in the future,  we will have  our friends and staff sit down together and enjoy the delicious food, there are about 50 -70 people in our group who would love to go out and sit down and enjoy some great Hong Kong style food as we did several years ago before the virus came into play.. Cant  wait to get back to normal and support our local restaurants  and enjoy great food in the company of our friends and staff.. Gong Hey Fat choy - Happy New Year 新年快樂 / 新年快乐."
5,"Cali was my choice for dim sum but since it&apos;s not currently open, MingHin has been my go to. I&apos;ve been several times since restaurants have been open from Covid-19 lockdown. Service is good since most servers speak English, ordering is rather tricky on the iPad, but the food is pretty good. I like the new outdoor set up in the summer. In Nov 2020 while I went for takeout, there was a tent set up around the tables, which has been a familiar scene."
3,"There are a good number of dim sum options in Chinatown and I think I&apos;ve rated the ones I&apos;ve been to 4 stars. They&apos;re more or less the same good food quality depending on what you favor. 

Some things were good and similar to other dim sum restaurants like the lotus leaf wrapped rice and chicken fingers. The crispy skin pork belly was really good!

But really common dishes like the rice noodles rolls and shrimp dumplings kept falling apart when we pick them up. And I noticed this issue in two separate visits within two weeks. Also, our veggie dish was overcooked (all soggy, no crunch) and tasted bland."
5,"Definitely come here if you need to satisfy your dim sum cravings, even at nighttime!

A very nice dine-in semi-casual restaurant serving all day-all night dim sum items plus a la carte classic Chinese dishes. 

Food:

Dim sum items, a general score - 5/5 - delicious, hot, fresh and high quality ingredients 

Pork rice noodle with XO sauce - 4/5 - spicy sweet rice rolls with bits of dried shrimp
Yang Chou style fried rice - 4.5/5- looks appetizing with its colors and is very delicious 
Fu Kin style fried rice - 5/5 - a wet fried rice! That is it is covered with a sauce containing chicken, duck, shrimp, mushrooms, etc. It is definitely a different unique taste but equally appetizing 
Salted fish chicken fried rice - 4.5/5 - looks appetizing with its colors and is very delicious 
Fried rice noodle beef with soy sauce (Beef chow foon) - 4/5 - nice taste but not exceptional
Shredded Roast duck with pan-fried rice noodle  - 4/5 - nice taste but not exceptional 
Shredded BBQ pork with pan-fried udon noodle  - 4/5 - nice taste but not exceptional

Roast duck - 4/5 - not very meaty cuts 
BBQ pork - 4/5 - good but flavoring is quite sweet
Crispy pork belly - 4/5 - very tasty but only given few small square sized bites

Ambience:
Beautiful blend of traditional &amp; modern Chinese. Superior over all other restaurants in Chinatown square without a doubt.

Service:
Fast, efficient and reliable"
5,So much great that dine in is available there! Yet they do keep Covid precautions! And their Chinese cuisine is really on of the best my gastronomic experiences! Really good place and the service is awesome!
2,"I placed an order for pickup 90 min in advance - right as the restaurant opened. When I arrived to pick up the order at the time the restaurant told me, it was not ready. I had to wait 25 minutes. The waiting area was packed with people, and every indoor table I could see had people sitting at it. They seemed to have given up on social distancing entirely and seemed to be way above 50% capacity. One person who entered without a mask and brushed right past me, holding a glove to his face, and spoke to the front desk, and was not told to put a face covering on.
I tipped 20% on a pickup order because it&apos;s a pandemic, but between the half hour delay and the lack of covid safety measures, I won&apos;t do that again. They seem to be operating as if COVID isn&apos;t a thing. When other restaurants are following the rules and struggling, it&apos;s not great to see a restaurant packed and ignoring pickup orders."
5,"This is the best Chinese ever!! Reasonably priced, quick and DELICIOUS! Highly recommend!"
5,"Great selection and amazing food! My go-to dim sum restaurant in Chicago. Their food is always delicious, comes fast and price is fair. Definitely try the fatty pork with sugar! It&apos;s a combination you can&apos;t resist!"
