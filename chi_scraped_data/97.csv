5,"Last time when I was in Chicago on business, everyone asked if I tried deep dish pizza. Since it was a business trip, I didn&apos;t get to eat what I wanted.  So, finally the right opportunity came and I asked a former Chicagoan for his recommendations for the best deep dish pizza based on my preference and this was first choice.

They do not accept reservations. I called and was told a short wait. Due to COVID, we had to wait outside until I received a text message from them. They originally told me 20 minutes wait but ended up being only 5 minutes wait.

We ordered classic deep dish pizza to share and was told it takes 40 minutes.  They suggested to order appetizers while waiting. So I ordered a glass of wine or two...   wine was okay...

When I saw a pizza, I understand why it takes 40 minutes. Pizza was very hot and very cheesy. If you like cheese like me, this is a good place to try.

I was never a fan of deep dish before and I learned it is the best to eat deep dish pizza on a cold night right at a restaurant."
5,Cheese me please! This is one of those must visit spots whenever traveling to Chicago but be prepared to WAIT! It&apos;s so worth it though. The pie always takes about 45 to an hour to come to the table. So I definitely suggest ordering a couple apps and share or call in advance for take out.
4,"Lovely place! I was super glad to be able to dine in amidst COVID. The restaurant was empty when we went so I felt very safe. We got a deep dish pizza, calamari, salad, and two cocktails. We had to ask for the calamari to be cooked a little longer because I prefer them browned but besides that everything tasted awesome. Can&apos;t wait to come back!"
5,"Great customer service, nice waiters, friendly atmosphere, and good food. First time I had an actual authentic Chicago-style deep dish pizza and it was the best experience I had for my first time in Chicago.

Something I can mark off my bucket list!"
3,"Decent. It&apos;s a chain. This was my first deep dish pizza experience. It could have been better.

You have to eat it right away when it&apos;s hot otherwise the cheese is like a rubbery mess. I&apos;m sure there are better pizza options in Chicago but it&apos;s an experience."
3,"I know this is a sensitive subject for Chicagoan&apos;s but this pizza is mediocre at best. The wait time was not too bad and it was packed. The waitstaff was friendly. It had frozen taste like qualities. 

Quite frankly it taste like &quot;It&apos;s not delivery, its Digiorno!&quot;"
5,"Dear windy city, I truly love you! But as this brings up an age old debate on whether New York style thin crust pizza or Chicago style deep dish pizza is best. Personally I prefer , the thin crust more because it&apos;s  not to filling and the charing  brick oven option and the regular slice  is my preference but when I&apos;m craving /day dreaming of deep dish this my place to go. 

I have been to Pequod&apos;s and Lou Malnati&apos;s and Giordano&apos;s is the a WINNER ; my absolute favorite because it was a combination the other two places with sprinkle of amazing and I am thankful for this being everything that I expected and more. 

I think when it comes to a deep dish pizza layering is very important in addition to the right proporation of cheese to sauce. This pizza Meat and More Meat  Deep Dish contains pepperoni, salami, sausage &amp; bacon. So it&apos;s start with the wonder crust , than a layer of sausage and pepperoni , cheese , amazing sauce and top off  with the salmi and bacon!!!! I&apos;ll drop my mic, please go and  enjoy yourself :)"
5,"Always and forever our favorite pizza spot in Chicago! The staff is always kind and service is top notch.. 
They followed recommended guidelines and were limiting capacity while we were there,  but we were given the option to order our pizza ahead of time while we waited on our table and even then waited less than 20 mins to be seated. 
Hands down B.E.S.T. Pizza in Chicago!"
5,"This was the first meal that I had in Chicago because... I mean I had to right? It was my first time trying deep dish pizza and I loved it!! It was just me and my boyfriend, we ordered the Classic at the smallest size and we only ate 3 slices between us. One slice honestly feels like 2-3 regular pizza slices. 

The inside has the most beautiful cheese and contains mushrooms and bell peppers. I do think the crust is too think and hard to really eat though

Service was also amaazing!! Our bartender was serving us and she was awesome - even taught us how to make a new drink that&apos;s called &quot;Fire.&quot; Contains fireball, apple jack, and apple juice. I don&apos;t even like fireball and I loved it. 

This place is one of the essentials of Chicago - highly recommend!"
4,"Came here on holiday a few years back with my family, I believe we ordered salad, calamari and 2 deep dish  pizzas. We took some to go, we ordered so much! My brother loves this place. The best place to get deep dish. I saw a Giordano&apos;s on my recent trip to Las Vegas as well."
5,"I write this review as a New Jersey native so keep that in mind! This is definitely a stop you must make if you are eating your way through Chicago. As I&apos;m sure you might know, it&apos;s one of the &quot;famous&quot; Chicago deep dish chains. 

Couple of things for new comers: come hungry but be ready to wait. The pies take about 45 minutes to an hour to prepare. Also, unless you come with a large group, you will have leftovers but fret not, this is a good thing. 

You can take your pick of toppings you want but remember that the crust is stuffed with cheese, so choose accordingly. The staff is very friendly and helpful, especially to newbies and once your pizza arrives, they will be very happy to do a &quot;slow pull&quot; of a slice so that you can capture that money shot. 

So as a New Jersey native how do I feel about deep dish? It&apos;s delicious and definitely it&apos;s own thing! Can&apos;t compare apples and oranges! Either way, I will tell you, deep dish tastes better the next day so make sure to get some leftovers!"
5,"Ordered:
Chicago classic 
Chicken sausage deluxe 

My group came here shortly after the restaurant opened. We were seated immediately. Our server was friendly and welcoming. She gave us suggestions and advised that we should order quickly since it could take up to 45mins for a deep dish pizza. Our group of 6 ordered two medium pizzas. 

My initial thoughts was that the pizza was indeed very deep. Each bite was eating a piece of melted cheese. It was so cheesy and so good. However it was very filling and I couldn&apos;t eat more than two slices for the medium sized pizzas.

I personally prefer the chicken deluxe one although both are tasty. I like pizza with more vegetables.

Tip: view the menu before visiting the restaurant so you can order immediately when you&apos;re seated!"
5,Excellent customer service. Great sit down pizza restaurant with bar. The 45 minutes wait for the cook to order famous deep dish pizza is definitely worth the wait!! Cortez was very helpful with drinks and the pizza.
5,"First time in Chicago, so I decided to search for the best deep dish pizza, I fell on this place and I could not be any happier! Went to the bean and had it there. Perfect view, with a perfect pizza. Tried their pepperoni deep dish and their special fries, both were delicious."
3,"Went there and caught the lunch special. Ordered a sausage deep dish pizza with garlic fries. 

I experienced Giordanos before so it wasn&apos;t a big need for me to get all the works. 

Our food came out quick so no complaints. It wasn&apos;t has hot as I would expected. I guess since its pre-made all they have to do is it put it in the oven for a couple minutes. The fries were pretty good."
5,"The pizza was good. Super cheesy. The small deep dish is good for 3 people, which is awesome. Really friendly staff. Would recommend for a casual dining experience."
5,"*This review is for Giordano&apos;s nationwide mail order shipping service.
I ordered Giordano&apos;s pizza to be delivered to my home in Utah.  I had never mail ordered food before, so I had no idea what to expect.  I was so pleasantly surprised!!  The pizza arrived still frozen, even several days after being shipped. Of all the mail ordered food I&apos;ve splurged on since the beginning of the pandemic, this was by far the best packaged and arrived in the best condition (like, perfect).

Nothing beats a fresh, in-restaurant Giordano&apos;s pizza. However, their frozen pizzas are nearly just as delicious! I&apos;d say the biggest difference is the crust texture; I&apos;ve had a hard time getting it perfect in the oven and often have to microwave the pizza to soften the crust after taking it out of the oven. But it turns out really well after microwaving, and it heats up well for next-day leftovers. 

There are many ordering options available, but I&apos;d really recommend the plain cheese pizza. Extra sauce comes with the pizza, to be added just before putting it in the oven. I also like to make ranch dressing to go with the pizza, but I realize that may be considered sacrilege; maybe just pretend I didn&apos;t bring this up if this is offensive.

I am so grateful for Giordano&apos;s for providing this service, it has really made the life of this pandemic-induced shut-in much better. :)"
5,With so many pizza places the choices are very hard but this was a great choice. food was great and soooooooo good pizza. staff was well informed and helpful. check them out when in downtown chicago
5,"Do y&apos;all remember being a child and jumping for joy when you took the first bite of your pizza at Chuck E. Cheese? Now I&apos;m not comparing this deep dish at all to Chuck E. Cheese pizza, but I&apos;m talking about that delicious moment when that flat breaded cheese pizza touched your not even mature palette and it was all heaven and goodness and pure &apos;90s joy? Well the moment was like that, but better! This location wasn&apos;t far at all from where we were staying (off the river @ the LondonHouse), just a brisk walk. We walked inside and were greeted by the hostess who then lead us to our table. We quickly scanned the menu with the QR code. We started off with the &quot;Calamari and more&quot;, which was calamari and banana peppers, light breaded and fried. It was good, but when we finally got our pizza (Classic Chicago?), it blew EVERYTHING out of the water. It was amazing, it was so tasty, just the right amount of softness and flavor and not too much tomato sauce. I am seriously salivating right now just remembering the 3 slices I inhaled. I will literally make a trip back to Chicago just for this place again!!!

I visited during covid (well it&apos;s still covid now), and tables were spaced out nicely, bathrooms were very clean and there was a huge bottle of hand sanitizer at the hostess stand."
3,"Giordano&apos;s was my first time having deep-dish pizza ever... and it might be the last time. We walked here from the nearby Cloud Gate (aka The Bean) so we knew Giordano&apos;s might be crowded with tourists. Lo and behold, there was a wait when we got there, but they allowed us to place our order while we were waiting since deep-dish pizzas take a while to bake. You could choose what size you want for their World Famous Deep Dish Pizza, and we chose the small, which comes with six slices. We wanted to try other dishes too, but we saw some other tables eating just the deep-dish. When the pizza came, the server immediately began serving without allowing us to take photos first. I have to say I like my regular New York pizza more. 

We also got one of their lunch specials - $9.95 for a main course and a side. We got a sandwich with fries. It was decent... nothing to write home about. We also got a pasta dish and it was absolutely terrible. It did not look appetizing and the taste reflected that. The spaghetti was so bland that even I can make something better than that."
