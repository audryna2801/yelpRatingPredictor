4,"I will start by saying holy cow! When they adopted the whole go big or go home theme for this place they weren&apos;t kidding! 

Well this is a 21 and over place so keep your kids at home when you&apos;re coming here. I stayed here a couple times already and I&apos;ll detail my experience below and without further adieu.

CHECK IN: check-in was quite efficient, everybody behind the desk has a truly professional approach and displays copybook guest service.

ROOM: I booked the Circa Suite both times. It is majestic looking. Everything has a blue and gold theme. The room has a bar area right when you come in everything is controlled electronically and there is an iPad tablet type thing in the room where you can make your local calls from listen to a radio station and request service from. The bathroom is amazing, the gold theme in the bathroom makes everything look luxurious .....the shower has awesome pressure and is very relaxing. The living area I can&apos;t say enough good things about and the bed also was top of the line. I had to stay twice.

STADIUM SWIM: This 6 pool colossal swimming venue was absolutely stunning. Anticipation is sometimes better than the real thing as they make this big production of you going up a three floor escalator in anticipation of what you&apos;ll find at the top... but when you get there you realize that what you find is just as great as what you dreamed of. The water is 90 degrees there&apos;s a 143 ft TV where they have hockey watch parties and everything else. Holy cow. And the pool is open very late... if the lifeguards don&apos;t get bored and decide to close early like what happened one day.

CASINO: the casino is large and if you remember Vegas Vicky the large neon statue ....well its in the middle of the casino. They have air vents coming up from the floor instead of from overhead which is very unique. There are several restaurants which look very good but also look very expensive ..The mega bar is also the largest Bar West of the Mississippi. Did I mention the three-floor Sportsbook?

The service I received here was superb, but the reason why it&apos;s not a five-star experience is because of the following:

1- While all other casinos have stopped charging for parking, Circa charges $25 for parking which is more than Aria or Bellagio even charged.

2- On my first day at midnight I got a random knock on the door from a housekeeping employee stating they thought the room was vacant. What do you need a vacant room for at midnight? ...ESPECIALLY when I had occupied the room all day."
3,"I really like circa as a place to visit and I loooove the restaurant downstairs Barry&apos;s.
I also like the ID check and adults only. 
What I don&apos;t like is the underage looking like dancers - maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m a female but I&apos;m all for the dancing dealer girls just gosh they couldn&apos;t go any younger really.
Fun place to visit and I valet for free close by but can&apos;t tell you where it&apos;s the best kept secret for locals. Circa should make parking for locals free as well honestly.

If you are concerned about Covid restrictions, stay away from the sports book in the weekend because their overall space allows them to have it packed."
4,"We chose to stay at Circa Resort and Casino because our dinner reservation was at Barry&apos;s Prime Steakhouse which is in the hotel. Barry&apos;s will be  reviewed separately.
The hotel is new and it was a great opportunity to experience the property. They are following Covid 19 guidelines and everyone we saw were wearing face masks.
Valet Parking is convenient and is $7.50 for hotel guests. Non guests pay $15.00. The check in desk is conveniently located near the valet drop off. The hotel casino, shops and restaurants are all close by due to the size of the property which is small in comparison to major hotels on the strip.
We arrived at the published check in time of 3 PM Our room was not ready as the cleaning crew was running behind due to the large number of departures the day after the Super Bowl. The desk said they would text us as soon as the room was ready. While waiting we enjoyed cocktails at Vegas Vickie&apos;s lounge which a tribute to Vegas Vickie who&apos;s movable neon sign is adjacent to the lounge.
After a one hour wait I checked with the desk on the availability of the room. They were able to find an available room on the 17th floor. The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. Our king room had a sofa plus 2 side chairs. The bathroom has a large shower and 2 sinks with plenty of counter space. The window view was to north and the Sheep Range mountains.
Rooms are equipped with tablets which serve as the communication device.
Since we do not participate in gaming, I do not have any comments on the casino. The sports book is enormous and would be a great place to enjoy sporting events. The Stadium Swim also has great viewing from the pool, day beds or cabanas. There is no charge for hotel guests to enter the Stadium Swim. However non hotel guests pay $10.00
The Legacy Club is a beautiful lounge on the 60th floor and is a must visit for sunsets. Legacy Club will be reviewed separately.
There are a number of dining choices at Circa and several on my list are project BBQ, Victory Burger and Saginaw Deli. We had breakfast at Saginaw&apos;s and enjoyed the pancakes. I look forward to trying the other places on a future visit plus another visit to Saginaw Deli for a signature sandwich and soup.
It is a short walk from the hotel elevators to the valet parking pick up. Just walk across the indoor connecting bridge to the Garage Mahal."
4,"Definitely glad I experienced seeing a new downtown casino. Parking was easy and plenty of open spots. There is a parking charge, so keep that in mind.
21 and over, they will check your ID upon entering, make sure you bring with. 
I was impressed with the expansive sports book! 

Everything was super clean and well laid out. I also liked the cocktail waitress uniforms, very classy and a bit trendy.

I didn&apos;t stay long, but it was worth a peek in and out. 
Recommend if you&apos;re in the downtown area."
3,"We went here for my birthday. Everything was great I think the hotel looks beautiful and cannot wait to enjoy a summer day by the pool if I decide to go back. This is really a review on a hotel stay that was cut short. It was my birthday and we had booked just a regular room for the night. It 
Was nice but nothing too crazy. The gentleman gave us a room that looked over the Stadium swim area.We went to dinner and about 10 o&apos;clock  we were in the room we got a phone call and had to leave immediately and checkout. What a bummer. I had explained to them we had an emergency and would not be using the room. 
I was extremely disappointed that they didn&apos;t offer me even a discount on the room as they could use it if needed.  I paid for the resort fee plus hotel stay about 200 and I just thought it would of been  standard to at least take of the resort fee.  Other than that it is a cool little place!"
5,"What an amazing sports book inside Circa!  The seats are comfortable and it&apos;s so large, there&apos;s an escalator taking you to the different levels.  When there&apos;s more time, I&apos;ll sign up for their betting app and compare it to Westgate&apos;s and William Hill&apos;s. 

Stadium Swim will also be a future to-do but as of today, the February weather is as cold as a witch&apos;s...a witch&apos;s...whatever the saying is.  The pool does look like a great place to watch a surfing competition from Oahu&apos;s North Shore on the monstrous tv screen outside.  

Vegas Vicky hasn&apos;t aged a bit over the years and appears to still be in a good place, even after a contentious split-up with Vegas Vic.  I always thought he felt threatened by this strong, independent woman....a bad-ass who openly carries a loaded .45 caliber in her holster. Thankfully she&apos;s inside now and didn&apos;t end up in the Neon Boneyard, ducking pigeon poop all day.

On a weekday afternoon, the lowest blackjack minimum that day at Circa was $15, which isn&apos;t bad for a brand new casino. There are some in town for $10 and a couple where $5 is the minimum, but that often comes with a musty smelling carpet and a disinterested card dealer whose only words the entire time are to the pit boss - &quot;One large!&quot; and &quot;Color up, one black out!&quot;   It may be too small of a sample size, but at least my dealer at Circa that day had a personality.

Despite all the entertainment options in town, I&apos;ll definitely keep Circa in the rotation and bring relatives there when they come to visit."
5,Had a great time gambling at Circa.  The stadium style area of the casino was very cool and the rooftop bar offered an amazing view of the city at sunset.
1,"Being a Las Vegas local I have watched this hotel be built from the ground up, watched the demolition of the old Las Vegas Club and was super excited to see a new hotel be built on Fremont street, we haven&apos;t had anything new downtown in the last 4 decades, so this was going to be a treat for all of us. 

They announced in the late summer that progress on the hotel was moving fast and the doors would open to the casino right before Halloween. I was out of town when they opened but so excited to head there as soon as I got back, well with the hustle of everyday life I didn&apos;t make it until yesterday 12/17/2020. A friend called and asked if I wanted to go watch some Thursday night football at their sports book, of course I said Yes! I was super excited because I was finally able to go to a hotel I watched be built. 

Upon getting downtown we decided to park in the parking garage since this was the only hotel we were going to, upon entering we realized that parking is $4 an hour and $15 for valet, we thought strange, my friend stated when they had originally opened parking was free for locals. We didn&apos;t didn&apos;t think anything going forward. Upon exiting the elevator to the bridge into the casino you are stopped by an obnoxious security guard scanning your ID&apos;s and yelling at you to have them out because this is a 21 and over establishment. 

Upon walking across the bridge and entering the casino I am carded again! Very thoroughly making sure that I am obviously 21 and over... The casino is beautiful, the sports book is the most amazing thing I have ever seen, but I am highly disappointed that nothing is geared towards locals, I understand that Vegas is mostly tourist based but because of covid most of us in these casinos are Las Vegas locals, we are your clientele right now, we are what is keeping this place going besides the California&apos;s driving out every weekend and completely turning this place upside down. 

I really hope that in the near future they offer something to us locals like free parking. Another turn off about this place is all the bellman they have in suits acting like security watching us like hawks, I don&apos;t know if it was because of the Raider game or if it&apos;s always like this but wow I felt like I was being watched the whole time, needless to say I was so uncomfortable I left at halftime and finished at home. 

I&apos;ll give this place another chance at a later time, I was not impressed yesterday I&apos;ll wait for them to work all the kinks out and return."
5,Checking in and Angel Chavez the front desk attendant is sooooo amazing kind and helpful enjoying my stay already
4,"Quite the nice Downtown Las Vegas casino! 

If you&apos;re driving there, find the &quot;Garage Mahal&quot; (a pay-for parking structure; $4/hour, $25/day, I think) on Main Street, just north of The Plaza. I liked that it was really well lit, compared to some other casino properties. We parked and walked to the Circa and on the connector bridge, we were asked for our ID... Oh yeah! This place is adults only! No children running around, no family focused entertainment. Sweet.

This place is clean, fabulous, and swanky. Nice and modern for the Fremont Street in Downtown. The table games were nice to look and play at. Seemed like all the dealers were models and if that wasn&apos;t enough, there&apos;s another one behind the dealers, go-go dancing to the upbeat pop music. 

There&apos;s lots of space and on this Friday night there was a ton of people (mostly properly social distancing) and yet still I felt comfortable in the walkways. While I&apos;m standing there, I noticed these circular gutter things on the ground. It&apos;s actually the air conditioning lightly pumping cool air into the casino!

I came here on this day to eat somewhere nice but the only really nice place is Barry&apos;s Prime which was completely booked until next month. The asian themed spot, 8 East, was the next option with service. Every other spot was too casual, but I still want to try it out. Victory Burger, Saginaw&apos;s Deli (24/7), and Project BBQ (the food truck outside) would be great bites for when I&apos;m here all boozed up while I watch the football games at the sportsbook.

Speaking of which, The Sportsbook. It&apos;s like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before. I would say it&apos;s the draw of the casino. Three floors of video screens, several booths for your group, and video/slots lining the railings of each floor. If you wanted to watch a game here, it should be no problem.

There&apos;s nothing I didn&apos;t like and there&apos;s more I haven&apos;t seen. Didn&apos;t get a chance to check it out on this visit, but Stadium Swim is a must next time. This rooftop has a $10 cover charge but it has first come first serve seating, reserved cabanas, a live dj, and restaurants/bars."
5,"The trip to this casino was not planned. Was just driving around with absolutely no idea of what to do ( I know how can you be so bored in Vegas ) lol. So I stumbled upon this place and figured I&apos;d check it out since it&apos;s fairly new. 

Our only parking option was the garage which charges you $4 per hour. There are also other pay rate options for those planning to stay longer. When you are ready to leave, there are kiosks located at the elevators going to the garage levels. Just scan your parking ticket. You can pay with cash or card there. If you forget. No worries. You can pay at the exit. I believe that only takes card payments. 

Before you can enter the actual casino. There is an employee at the entrance scanning IDs ( only 21 and over allowed to enter ) so don&apos;t bring the kiddos. 

Upon entry I was greeted with the delicious aroma of coffee. It was calling my name. Sadly I did not stop and get me some. Lol

Just around the corner I was taken away by the super sized mountain of a sports screen. It was the biggest I have ever seen. Haha. That&apos;s what she said. Anyway. This was the best part of my visit. 

Overall. The casino was really clean. There is sanitizer throughout on both floors. And there are some really good restaurants to try. Easy access to the Fremont experience from here. So check this place out. You won&apos;t be disappointed"
3,"Came here last weekend on November 7 and pretty busy for being the newest casino in downtown, Las Vegas. As we entered the casino through the garage  there  was only one security person  checking ID&apos;s  but no temperature checks however, masks is required. Almost felt like it was pre-covid and it was difficult to social distance with everyone just walking every where in different directions but I got through it  by dodging people. 

 Just walking around and seeing the hype of this place and 3 major highlights  of this casino would be their Sports book. Sports book is  huge with 2 levels. Almost felt like you were in a concert theater. Second, would be their Mega Bar which is the longest bar in Nevada with gaming and third would be Stadium Swim which  I did not go and check it out but just looking at the registration check in is huge like a hotel check in.  

Plethora of slot machines and spaced out.  A few restaurant  options that I saw  and one coffee shop:  A burger joint called Victory Burger, a deli called Saginaws,  Asian fast casual restaurant, 8 east and  a steakhouse , Barry&apos;s  that has its own 3rd floor inside of the casino but no view. A few gift/souvenir shops and  Chris Ihle Gallery, a Lego artist that specializes in life size figures.  I ask a female assistant if he worked for Lego&apos;s which  he does not work for Legos but is a third party. Overall, the architecture of the building and the art deco streamlined lighting were my favorite things about the casino."
5,"October 2020

I had a great time losing my money here!

 Welcome to Circa, the latest brand new concept hotel in downtown Las Vegas. One of the biggest takeaways is the fact that it&apos;s 21 and up only.

 Various security guards are placed at each entrance that checks your identification. That alleviates the need to continuously show identification throughout your stay.

 I will be the 1st to admit that I avoid certain hotels because I know that there is an influx of children running through the casino and throughout the property. What&apos;s fun about Circa is that it features adults doing the exact same thing! Throughout the casino you can hear and see adults having the best (or worst) times of their lives.

 In other ways, Circa is definitely the standard of hotels in downtown Las Vegas. It fits right into the Fremont experience, and misses nothing that other casinos bring to the downtown strip.

 I, of course, had to wave down several waitresses while at Penny slots, but had expected that anyway. And once I built a relationship a certain waitress, she took care of us the right way throughout the night.


Ambience:
5/5
Service:
4/5

Bottom line:

Come have some fun!"
5,"This is one amazing place

I was initially saddened when they closed up Mermaids and other places around here to build a new casino. 

Fast forward to today and the architecture is simply amazing.  Once you walk in security greets you and you show your ID and get a temp scan.  

The Sports Book is huuuge!! You need to watch a game there but the game changer is Stadium Swim. This is the place to be. We were there for the Thursday Night Football party and it was spectacular!!! The various pools, the Big screen TVs.  These are not your mothers 13 inch black and white TVs - lol

They have a DJ and a very decent sound system. Plenty of lifeguards and security as well. Only thing missing here is a water slider -lol

Again the entire casino is beautiful and the bars, shops are really nice.  We checked out Vegas Vickies for a drink as well. 

We didn&apos;t win anything on the slots but that&apos;s gambling. Hopefully next time 

Since they screen the guests coming in you will not encounter any bums or seedy people begging for money like other places on Fremont.  

We&apos;ll be back!!"
4,"Whoa. Beautiful. The sports book here is phenomenal.  I haven&apos;t had a chance yet to sit in the venue and watch games but just the aerial view alone, I can tell you this spot is amazing.  I think I would prefer to sit higher up than on the ground floor at the root of the action, but that is primarily because of the fact that there is a bar just behind those seats that is easily accessible and in the midst of the action on the casino floor. I watched a few short portions of the games that were on the TVs.  The view from up there was beautiful. On top of that, each and every tv was clear.  

Parking is NOT free but it was ample and fairly easy to navigate, unlike many other hotel lots.  I love that the parking lot is so well lit and clearly marked.  Look for the garage mahal signs. 

The guards at the entrance to the hotel and casino are there to merely check that those entering are at least 21 years of age.  They have been very strict about this casino and hotel remaining a business of adults only. I can appreciate that, for sure.  It was nice not to have to worry about little ones running around the casino floor. 

I walked much of the property. I noticed that their BBQ spot is really located outside their casino and faces the Fremont strip area, closer to the golden gate hotel.  Their mega bar is indeed impressive.  I can picture crowds congregating at this bar when things like that are allowed again.  Their bartenders are friendly and they are full of energy.  They use their flair when they mix drinks and it is always fun to watch.  Even if the mega bar bartenders aren&apos;t doing flair, the ones outside usually are.  I love that little bit of extra-ness.  Who doesn&apos;t want a show along with their drinks? 

Their deli was impressive.  I saw nothing but happy customers and huge portions as I passed by and looked over their menu. They have a lot of the classics, matzo ball soup, huge deli sandwiches, tuna melts, etc.  

I wanted to head outside to check out their pool but I didn&apos;t have a reservation and I also wasn&apos;t going to pay the bottle minimum to get a table.  Maybe one of these days I&apos;ll stay there and be able to access the pool.  Otherwise, I think it was $10+ per person to hit up the pool area.  Something that I should have asked the person working the entrance was what amenities in the pool area were available or not. 

I am looking forward to hitting up the legacy club also. The views look amazing. I have also seen folks enjoying s&apos;mores up there. Looks fantastic. 

Barry&apos;s prime rib is phenomenal.  I think it&apos;s one of the downtown old vegas strip area&apos;s best kept secrets.  Yes their menu is a tad pricey but it is darn good.  Their sides are decadent and all ordered a la carte. The service is friendly and proactive more than it is reactive. It&apos;s all in the small details."
5,"Went and checked it out the other afternoon. An informative and pleasant security man, Ben Drose delighted us with some vintage scavenger hunt hints! A+++"
4,"In A Nutshell:

-Circa is the latest new hotel/casino/resort in Vegas.
-If you are a sports fan, this is designed for you.
-They have the BEST SPORTSBOOK I&apos;ve ever been in around the world from Macau, to the Caribbean, New Zealand/Australia to here.
-Everything is sparkling new.
-The sportsbook area is HUGE, w/ stadium seating, plenty of big screens &amp; video poker around the upper levels.
-Parking is right across the street w/ nice brightly illuminated numbers that  help you keep track of which floor you parked on.
-Be prepared to show your ID prior to entering the casino.

Overall, this new casino is anchored on the eastern end of Fremont Street."
2,"On my most recent trip to Vegas I had to come check out Circa.  Leading up to the trip, I saw Circa all over social media with its stadium pool and it&apos;s huge sports book.  I was really looking forward to seeing it first hand.  We got dropped off in the middle of Fremont and we made our way down to the end where Circa is located.  There was a line to get in with security doing thorough searches.  Not a big deal to me.  Once inside, we just kind of wandered around aimlessly looking for the sights.  We found the pool, but we could not even see it due to it being closed fairly early in the evening.  first bummer of the night.  The sports book was cool and large.  Screens everywhere, high and low.  I can see this as a cool place to hang if I was there specifically to bet sports.  I decided to try my luck with some blackjack.  My friends and I sat down, but our girls were told to step away.  This was their Covid rules, but it was literally just our group, not large at all.  I wanted to show them how to play but that idea went out the window.  The two dealers we dealt with were not friendly at all.  No personality whatsoever.  When I gamble, I like a lively table where everyone has fun.  This was not the case here.  I looked around and saw the same dull tables everywhere.  I doubled my money and got up just because I was not feeling it.  

Overall, I think this place has potential as a cool destination, but they need to work the kinks out before I drop any more money into this place.  I looked into booking here for a weekend get away soon and the prices are comparable to some of the super nice hotels on the strip.  I just can&apos;t justify those prices if I&apos;m not staying in a room with a view on the strip."
4,"Casino was great. Love the &quot;Vintage Vegas&quot; esthetic throughout. There are several stories to the Casino along with huge game screens.

I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see the Circa become the prime casino in downtown.

21+ is required thus, your ID is scanned before entering (not ideal for most) a simple date check would have been sufficient, however, it is nice to not have to take your ID out again while drinking. 

Be sure to check out Vegas Vickie&apos;s Bar. 5/5

All in all, experience was good."
4,"I haven&apos;t stayed here yet, but I have visited twice now. In 2 weeks I will dine here and, possibly, take in a VGK game.
What I will not do is let the condescending comment &quot;Good evening, young lady&quot;, from the door monitor, pass without response.
I am 60 fucking years old and don&apos;t need some twat balding man making any comment about me, to me.
He can say &apos;Good Evening&quot;. That is all."
