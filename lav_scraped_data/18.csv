4,"Stayed here during my Birthday month, last trip of the year!!

The hotel is BEAUTIFUL I ABSOLUTELY LOVE all the Christmas decorations, for me it really puts you in the holiday spirit.

The hotel itself has a lot of Asian inspired decor with a modern twist and I love that mixture as well. Classy and elegant 

I stayed on the 58th floor, my room had a &quot;panoramic view&quot;  First off the beds are &quot;awesome&quot;  sooo comfortable!!!  Its like laying on a bed of clouds.

There was a sunk in tub with jets!! I LOVE taking baths, the water got extra hot and that was a plus for me.

When we ordered breakfast our food was delivered to us on a rolling table, that was pretty cool and COVID friendly, Breakfast prices can be kinda pricey for a &quot;MEXICAN BREAKFAST&quot; ( I didn&apos;t make up that title) it is $40 
So I  just ordered country potatoes with a side of links and salsa.... the Salsa needs to be revamped. Sorry.. I am a Salsa/Hot Sauce queen and it was a NO for me.

The check in process was EASY, the customer service is great. I had $100 of hotel credit and I totally used it all.....  The employee who checked me in was very nice and super helpful. She told me the clubs and strip clubs are closed due to COVID  wompers..... (next time LOL)

We had a little bit of hiccup, Alexa was not working but that was fixed in no time.

Over all this is a Great place to stay at, awesome shopping, aesthetics are breathtaking, customer service was exceptional, I will for sure come back!!

MY ONLY COMPLAINT..... 

The Wynn is a classy, high end hotel no argument!!

As a guest I do appreciate security and measures taken to ensure guest are safe...

I really felt like I was at MOTEL 6  (or worse) when I was getting patted down, having to empty out my pockets, and open my purse every single time I entered the hotel.    I felt like I was about to see a jail house inmate or something.. 

Guest should only have to show hotel room key... all others should go through the prison pat down!!!  (in my opinion) 

THE END"
5,"Thanksgiving is a time to gather with those that matter most to us. Can you remember? Walk down memory lane with me. Mama is cooking in the kitchen, while she runs a full service dinner from the kitchen directing us to stir here and cut this dad is watching the game screaming at the television because his team is not winning. Now that I am the one running the kitchen watching my twins make and stir this time ever revolves around. This year we were told to forget Thanksgiving. 

It&apos;s in our nature to come together. Yes with the holidays these days we need one another, but due to COVID measures must be taken to protect one another. The city is not on another shut down but, the capacities must be cut in half in order to keep individuals safe and healthy. A lot of times we cannot see the hard decisions that need to be made, the Wynn is making this transition as easy as possible. Tryin to keep our thanksgiving little this year, it&apos;s just the immediate family. After the medical procedure that I had done we went Thanksgiving 2020; in the Wynn. All that we asked the hotel to provide was done with no problem. Our stay this time here was just over a week and wow what a spectacular one. 

The Wynn Cares! From the moment that you walk through the door, your home. Your safety is paramount here. The mask is enforced in all public spaces, due to the governs issues. The mask rule will be enforced here. When you visit the bar area, especially the one right after the guest elevators the level of service is just so different than the last time I was here. The service now is more personalized. When we had drinks at the bar; it was done off to the side stools since a six feet barrier must be observed between patrons. For those wanting to drink and gamble at the bar, here inside the Wynn you still can. If you want to walk up and grab that drink from the bar their is a special area roped off for those drinks too. The Wynn is doing all in its power to ensure your stay is happy, safe, and healthy. 

Whats not happy about the Wynn? As you walk the rows of shops from top to bottom it&apos;s always an excellent experience. The safety measures are being felt with limited times that we can spend in one place where all the public shares. The hotel now is operating with twenty percent occupancy, but in all the rooms the safety measures are made loud enough that they care. The staff here is making sure extra security measures are enforced for those having access to the hotel rooms, with security levels on high. It&apos;s surreal to see Vegas have so many heightened expectations about this virus. They really are taking care of you, so that you can relax and enjoy a wonderful time. 

When to room service? Let&apos;s take a little walk and see where we end up. This trip was about coming closer to the twins. We have not had much quality time. Life takes new meaning when it is distributed and thrown off its access. We need time to heal both mental, physically, and spiritually; it&apos;s all about the fam here. Life is a beautiful journey but our joy can be taken away at any time. We are living life, and feeling the bliss and blessings of that love. The Wynn met all of the requests that we made. After the out patient surgery the recovery process was epic with all the perks available right from the room. The remote comes with in house movies and at the push of a button we&apos;re watching The Godfather Series. The in room dining can be ordered right from the television with movie candy and drinks all bundled together. Take a soak in the tub and the movie that you were watching in the bedroom now plays tub side. 

Bubbles in the glass and around my toes as the movie comes to an end. Wanting to add a little special magic to your trip here&apos;s how the Wynn makes you feel as though you are a rockstar. You can have chocolate placed under your pillow. Slip out and take the pup for a walk. Hit the gym, which is still open during the partial shut down, then come back to turn down service and chocolat covered strawberries left while your being tucked in. These services cost extra but worry about the big stuff and those small details always fall right into place and make life that much sweeter. It&apos;s the holidays make the most of the time we have each and every day by spending time together here at the Wynn. Let&apos;s celebrate the end of 2020 with the sparkling lights as we ring in 2021."
5,"As an anniversary getaway, my hubby and I decided to take a little road trip to Vegas after he scored an awesome deal for a 3-night stay at the Wynn. This was our first time traveling outside of SoCal during the pandemic so we before heading there, we did a LOT of research to ensure that they were COVID-compliant and everything looked good. 

Our trip was from Sunday to Wednesday so we were glad to see that there were less people upon our arrival and duration of our stay. All staff were wearing masks and consistently cleaning/disinfecting, and there were partitions at the check in counter, so we felt safe during our check in. They also enforced a 25% capacity throughout all establishments in Vegas and most were compliant with that. Self-parking was free which was a bonus!! 4 persons max in the elevator as well.

Now to our room; we booked a Standard King but because we were celebrating our anniversary, the gentleman that checked us in upgraded us to a beautiful suite with a panoramic view. It was a near perfect room! Automatic curtains, beautiful view, great shower pressure, comfortable bed, and all the amenities you need for a pleasant stay. The only con I can think of is that there wasn&apos;t an outlet to charge my phone beside my bed so I had to use my hubby&apos;s side -- minor issue but worth mentioning. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and got to use resort credit at The Wynn Terrace, Spa, and Urth Caf√©. Of all the hotels we&apos;ve stayed at in Vegas, the Wynn is definitely our favorite. Classy but modern with a hint of whimsical. We will 100% be back!!"
1,"Wynn is starting to show signs of age, at least in its bathrooms, where one of my room&apos;s vanity sinks backed up with raw sewage. Booked 2 rooms through Amex Travel Fine Hotels and Resorts program and this is the first property I&apos;ve ever stayed at through FHR that fell alarmingly short. (I had a superb stay at Encore in the Tower Suites 3 years ago.)

Missed a highly anticipated dinner reservation due to the over one hour of emergency plumbing in the room required, paid a penalty that I did not ask Wynn to reimburse. Technician diagnosed the issue on his first visit as raw sewage. Returned with tools and a second technician, but did not give notice a second worker was entering, nor did they knock upon reentry. One was not wearing sufficient COVID PPE, in my opinion. In the ensuing chaos, one personal item may have been lost, which I did not ask Wynn to reimburse, either. Housekeeping was then required to clean afterwards.

The room rates were quite low, and the time I spent dealing with this issue (out of principle) far exceeds the money spent. I was offered an upgrade on future stay and waiving of resort fees, which was, to be honest, hard to swallow given I was brushing my teeth in the shower with bottled water.

The sink problems and gurgling/odor reocurred after initial contact with Wynn manager, but at that point I was close to checkout and knew I would have to contact American Express for further chance of resolution. I have contacted Amex FHR and have been informed we are awaiting approval from the Wynn wholesale team for a refund of at least this 1 very problematic room, when I feel that a refund of my entire stay should have been offered at the very outset. If you&apos;re looking for a safe resort and refuge in pandemic times, I&apos;m not sure Wynn is the property for you."
4,This was a very beautiful place very festive and decorative I thought I thought the security check in at the door was kind of weird but other than that it was very beautiful I took a star back for the cigarette smoking cuz it ruined it for me
4,"Very happy with the Wynn.  The windows were a bit dirty and there was a couple jolly ranchers on the floor of our room when we arrived.  Which was weird.   The loss of the star  though came from the checkin process.   He had my license and new it was my birthday.   He was, I believe trying to be funny and make a joke about my age.  The joke fell flat and was pretty offensive.   Other hotels  on the strip have equal the luxury and half the price.  I was not awed like I thought it was going to be."
4,"Ever since we started playing the Wynn Slots game app, this has been our go to staycation on the Strip. We have earned so many free nights!

The property is beautiful and always sparkling clean. As for the staff, it is mostly five star customer service but we have had a few bad experiences.

We usually get a high floor strip view room. The views of the strip are  unparalleled. We have stayed in the resort towers in a suite. The housekeeping staff knocked it out of the park. The amenities are top notch.

The resort has several pools, tons of restaurants, and lots of shopping. Our favorite dining experiences are the bottomless brunch and Friday night seafood experience at the buffet, Wazuzu, and bottomless brunch at the Terrace Cafe."
5,"The. Wynn. Is. The. Best. Hotel. In. Vegas. 

Every time I come to Vegas, I stay at the Wynn. The hotel is the beacon of luxury, hospitality, and beauty in Vegas. 

My favorite room is the panoramic room. If you can, get a view of the strip. It&apos;s absolutely incredible. The service is always fantastic &amp; the concierge is always a seamless experience.

The luxury shops are astounding, the pool was clean (even during COVID), and all food choices are perfect. 

I love the fact that the Wynn is at the end of the strip too because you don&apos;t experience the mass crowds you would at another centralized hotel. 

I could go on and on about my affinity for this hotel. Just know if you want class, taste, luxury, relaxation, and a taste of Vegas you will find it at the Wynn."
5,"Wynn took the COVID precaution to another level. They have infrared temperature checks. Everyone had to wear a mask and if you didn&apos;t have one they had new ones to be given in many areas. Hand sanitizers were placed in so many areas. 

But the bed....oh my goodness. It was soooooo comfortable and nice and cozy . The cleanliness of the room was top level. They provided 2 face masks, a nice gel hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes in each room. I was on the 26th floor and got a great view of the strip and surrounding area. 

The staff members were really helpful and nice. It was my birthday so I dined at the newly revamped buffet. You get the same all you can eat but instead of getting it yourself the wait staff brings the food in petite plates. Only a few misses with the food but it was worth it."
5,"As a popular tourist attraction, Las Vegas has born a crushing economic burden due to Covid-19 lockdowns. As parts began to reopen, I ventured out to the Wynn to explore the new, alien world.

Once I arrived, I immediately observed that the Wynn had taken reopening quite seriously. Every entrance had Asian airport-style temperature scanners. Hand sanitizer dispensers dotted the casino floor and any location where staff occupied fixed positions, such as card tables and concierges. Staff aggressively sanitized after players left the tables as well.

All staff members wore masks and would chase you down if you did not comply with mask requirements. Casino dealers would refuse to continue dealing cards if someone removed a face mask to take a sip of beer and forgot to put the mask back on.

Ordinarily, I would drone on about the amenities of the hotel room I booked relative to its price point and competitors&apos; offerings. I would mull the benefits of a single king bed Tower Suite room for $200/night on a weekday.

During Covid-19, however, I must prioritize other concerns. The level of effort put into Wynn&apos;s reopening inspires confidence for vacationers looking to ameliorate cabin fever without purchasing a one-way ticket onto a ventilator."
5,"This place is nothing short of amazing. Luxurious. Posh. Elegant. Sexy. Fun. It is worth the stay. We went for our honeymoon and it was wonderful especially during COVID 19. We ate at incredible restaurants. We enjoyed room service which had some of the best tasting coffee ever. Normally I can&apos;t sleep on hotel pillows, but not here. I slept amazingly well. The big bath tub was just incredible, especially since hot tubs were closed due to COVID. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. One night we stayed in and just watched movies on the comfy bed. If you want snacks they have a great snack bar and mini bar available in your room. They maintain safety very well. They enforce state guidelines
For Covid. The staff is friendly and helpful. The light show was amazing to view on the outdoor balcony. Every thing is wonderful about the Wynn. I really enjoyed myself. The shopping is extraordinary. The food is insane. The attention to detail is like no other."
1,"I was play and winning 
A manager get to me because of my shield
He like me to cover my eyebrow with this
Never have problems with this shield 
He just so me make money and stop my game"
5,"Review #200 is dedicated to this fine establishment. I&apos;m currently writing this review laying in bed here, enjoying the rest of my next few hours before hotel checkout. 

There&apos;s not too much I can really add to the really great things that&apos;s been said in majority of the previous reviews, but I will say this... Wynn Resort advertises their commitment to 5 star customer service, they stay committed to that. From the telephone calls with booking, the check in (assisted kiosk) service, the in-room phone assist (ordering room service, calling the front desk), and the room service delivery, email response, AND covid protocols, they have delivered. The organization takes pride in not only looking the part
(Purple blazered hosts throughout the resort and casino) but they present and display professionalism and patience at its finest. Think disney and chick fil a customer service meets calm, cool, and collected mature demeanor. LOL. 

As for covid-19 resort activity, I did find that there are still many people in the casino, shopping, restaurant, and walking areas, NOT OVER CROWDED, but still many. However, EVERYONE is wearing masks, and all the entrances have infrared temperature checks with staff screening 1 by 1, please be patient as they are preventing crowds to bypass screening. 
People were compliant with the 4 person per elevator guideline, and signs to wash hands are posted everywhere with available sanitizer stations. Rooms also come with masks, wipes and hand gel. 

Restaurant menus all available online with mobile ordering. 

Free self parking in structure. 

For best hotel rates join red card rewards /insider club online (not a credit card). 

Also they sell their bedding, bath and home collection online! 

FYI my stay was Saturday to Sunday.

***Support Wynn and Encore as they are trying really hard to pay their employees during this time. They recently announced furloughing; support good businesses that support their employees."
4,"Beautiful hotel to stay. We saw a concert at the Encore Theater. Seating was amazing. There was a slight problem with one of the speakers crackling but other than that a cool venue.

My room was very, very nice. My name was displayed on the TV to welcome me. I felt special. 

The buffet (in late February when it was open) was superb. We ate a lot of sweets and they were excellent. The peppered bacon was to die for. It&apos;s on the expensive side for other locations, but not for Vegas. There was a line to get in but we didn&apos;t have to wait long at all. It moved along quickly.  

There is plenty going on there including hopping bars, shopping, people watching and fun (high end) shopping that was too rich for my blood.

I loved that guests had to show their room keys before heading up to the guest floors. I felt more secure.

Why not five stars then?  SMOKING in the Casino. I know, I know. That&apos;s what you do in Las Vegas. I wish there were non smoking gambling areas. I think I would have enjoyed my time at the slots more. 

Overall, great stay with very comfortable amenities. Loved it."
4,"Wynn is one of the nicest resorts on the strip. After a lovely meal at SW Steakhouse, we decided to explore, admire their decor, and gamble. I liked how clean and well maintained the public areas were. The area before the casino was pretty and Instagram worthy. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s just for the holiday season but I liked the village and train set display and the lit up trees with different sized white, yellow, orange, and red pom-poms. I didn&apos;t have much luck with the slots but I had fun."
4,"Wynn is always that luxurious brand in Las Vegas even during the pandemic. They have been opened for about a month since the closure due to COVID-19. I cannot compare Wynn&apos;s cleanliness to other hotels but it has to be definitely near the top.

COVID-19 Precautions: Thermal monitors at all the entrances. All staff wear masks. They provide you masks, hand sanitizer and cleaning wipes in your room. Hand sanitizer stations everywhere in the hotel. They have signs showing no more than four people in an elevator. Plexiglass installed at check in counters and they wipe the counter between customers. They will give you free masks if you forget yours. 

Rooms: Here is why I deducted a star otherwise it would be a 5/5 review. We checked in to our room and did some inspections (again cuz the pandemic going on) and we saw two strands of hair on the pillow case.  We called the front desk and explained the concern and they immediately gave us another room.  So check around if you are paranoid like me.  No more mini bar fridge as it&apos;s locked. If you need anything they will bring to you. Wrapped plastic cups in the room and no more glass cups. 

Pool: It does get packed. We went on Friday around noon and there were many people already. Masks aren&apos;t required around the pool. Lounge chairs are spaced to ensure social distancing. Staff wear masks even the temperature was over 100. Staff also spray disinfectant on lounge chairs after someone leaves. Food is now in disposable containers. They give you a new pen wrapped in plastic every time you sign the bill and they toss the pen afterward. It&apos;s such a waste but again it&apos;s for the safety. Keep your pen so they don&apos;t have to waste one every time you sign a bill. 

Casino: Plexiglass are installed at most tables. Three customers at a table. Staff and customers have to wear masks. Hand sanitizers at every table as well. I also see staff wiping the tables when no customers are there. They block the middle seats between slot machines as well. 

Restaurants/bars: Again the tables are blocked here and there to keep social distancing. They give you a paper sheet to leave your mask on the table (very thoughtful). We only went to Parasol Down and not restaurants. Make reservations ahead as space is limited. Staff wipe down table and chairs after a party leaves. 

Overall: We felt pretty safe. You can see staff cleaning constantly and they deserve all the tips. It is a lot of work to keep customers and staff safe, and keep Las Vegas open. Don&apos;t be selfish and just follow the rules please."
5,"So beautiful. It was my first time staying at the Wynn &amp; I loved my stay so much, I booked an extra night.

Before entering, everyone is temperature scanned &amp; offered a mask before coming in. All employees wear a mask, plexi glass have been placed around gambling tables, signs that state that 4 people max are allowed in elevators, &amp; there are stickers on the floor to help distance people.

The rooms are sealed to notify you that it has been cleaned &amp; disinfected. To decrease touching remotes, light switches, drapes, etc, they have an Amazon Alexa in each room. If you are unsure on how to use an Alexa, there are instructions provided. The room also provides you with sanitation wipes, masks, &amp; hand sanitizer. The Wynn is taking all the right precautions &amp; helping their customers stay safe + feel comfortable. 

To help with your stay, they send you texts &amp; ask if you need help with reservations. They have made my stay so easy. I was able to make reservations for my husband &amp; I at Lakeside. 

Tip: the pool closes by 6pm, I would try to get there as early as possible to get a good spot!

Lastly, everyone is so accommodating. I was able to have a room that faced the strip, people have directed me to the right place, &amp; so much more. I&apos;ll definitely plan another staycation here."
2,While staying at the Wynn I had someone try to get into my room. Luckily I was literally just coming out of the bathroom so I was right there. The door opened and when I looked around the door frame I saw the door open about 6&quot;. I lunged at the door and slammed it shut and placed the security lever. I looked through the peephole and saw a dark individual right outside my door.  I called security and my husband.  Security never came by to check on me. My husband also called the hotel and they did not seem to terribly concerned about this.  They did note my door was opened and insinuated it was me.  Why would I open the door having just gotten out of the shower????   Whoever this guy was either  had access to the rooms or the door was not securely shutting.  Either way I was disappointed by Wynns lack of concern. If you choose the Wynn make sure you always use your security latch.
5,"Resort just opened yesterday, June 4. 

For those wondering, all employees are required to wears mask, but guests are not. Appears from our experience thus far that less than half of guests are wearing masks. Masks are available at front desk, concierge, or Red Card desk. Masks, sanitary wipes and disinfectant gel is provided in each room. 

All amenities and paper items in rooms are single use only. (Looks like all the progress we made environmentally during the shutdown will be made up for with single use everything). 

Rooms and linens are cleaned and disinfected daily and the room is then sealed to assure you no one has entered since then. 

Turn down service is only done upon request. 

In room controls (lights, drapes, temp) can be controlled via Alexa device. 

No minibar. Minibar offerings and ice are available through In-Room Dining. 

Must make reservations for the pool. No limit for how long you can stay and it sounds like there is no strict limit on number of people. 

Reservations required for the gym. 50% capacity limit and time limit of 45 minutes per person. 

Reservations for restaurants required. Buffet not open. 

No shows open yet."
5,"I feel safe, secure and clean staying there even during pandemic. Everyone must present and tap the key card before going to elevator section. I got the room on 20th floor with city view, so beautiful at night time you can see vegas view with lighting. The check out process is so fast and impress by droping key card in the box and you&apos;re ready to catch the flight. The interior and decoration at the lobby and casino area is so pretty. I&apos;ll be back for sure."
