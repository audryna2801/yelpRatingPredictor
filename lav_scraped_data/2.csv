4,"Two topics: 
1. Hotel stay
2. Stratosphere tower observation deck/rides

Hotel:

 I&apos;m on day four of my stay here as I write this and I&apos;m a little surprised by all the one and two star reviews. There are some downsides but for the price, it&apos;s unobjectionable. Â Here&apos;s a quick list: 

Negatives:
* Can&apos;t think of many. Some stuff feels old. Phones &amp; TV are examples.  no biggie. You can request one but there&apos;s no fridge in rooms generally. There&apos;s no microwave and fire code won&apos;t allow them. Worst is there&apos;s no coffee pot in room!!!  

Positives: 
1. Hotel WiFI does not require multiple &quot;accept&quot; walled garden pass through efforts.  the service works, without password, indefinitely. It&apos;s not likely very secure though.  
Internet is fast: 15Mbit down by 9 Mbit up

2. Very friendly and accommodating staff
You can get $37 rooms on vegas.com

3. Walking distance to restaurants &amp; shops to the strip
 
 
Overall its a pleasant place to stay. Bring some cold brew coffee and some cold drinks and request a fridge. The accommodations here have the potential to give you a contented stay.  

Best of all: use &quot; Ivy &quot; their SMS service bot.  so nice. i left a tip about this so check there. You can request hotel amenities with a text messsage!

Tower:
Hotel Guests can get a discounted pass to head up to the observation tower. There are both inside and outside observation decks.  

Accessing these areas costs around $47 to hang on the deck AND for one ride. Definitely try The Insanity:

Someone else pointed out: &quot;We used the &quot;bestofvegas&quot; web site and were able to get day time tickets for $27.95 unlimited rides and $12.00 for parents to observe.&quot;

also: 

&quot;To the best of my knowledge, the cost up the Stratosphere Tower to the observation deck is $24 per adult. These tickets can be bought at the reception at the bottom. We had about 10 minute wait for a lift. But it&apos;s well worth the wait. Best time to go up is just before dusk, then you see the view in daylight, but by the time you are ready to go down it will be night time when all the lights are on. There is no time limit at the top.&quot;"
5,"Thank you Strat for offering valet parking. You are the best! This is why I keep coming back. Great customer service and a beautiful establishment. 
I said it all! I love Strat! One of my go to places in Las Vegas to chill. 

Had a nice drink at bar and all was chill. No masks, just people enjoying life. 

I was offered a mask leaving, by security, saying I needed one to go to valet. Thanks. I don&apos;t need one to cross a few lanes to get to valet. 

Best valet in Las Vegas, always has been!!!!"
3,"Only three stars: this place is adequate but not awesome. The rooms are old and TV channels limited. Bed comfy and AC cold. Booked an upgraded room online with fridge, when I checked in I was offered a newer room with fridge (for an extra $40 per night!) -- no thanks! Talk about a bait and switch. The clientele is a bit sub par; leave it at that. Staff perfunctory and average. Not awful but not great; not a fan of the amenity charge when wifi is free for everyone (even in casino) so what the heck are we paying extra for? Masks on site and lots of sanitizer and wipes, which was nice to fight COVID. I think they should give guests the best rooms they have; not ask for extra money on site. Not a great time to travel; they should roll out the red carpet for brave guests. It&apos;s a nicer property than Luxor or Circus Circus, but not as nice as the web site makes it seem.

Only one pool open and no hot tubs. Limited shade offered. Lots of staff and lifeguards. They check your bag when entering; no food or drink allowed. (I was going to eat a taco by the pool, but they let me eat it by a trashcan nearby. Made everyone wear a mask if not in the pool. Food service not active at pool. Better than nothing but kind of a let down; not the typical Vegas scene. Good for older adults or people who want to snooze in the hot sun."
1,"Very disappointed. Upon arrival it took almost 40+  minutes just to check in. Got to the room and it was not cleaned since the previous people left. 
When entering the hallways it smells like weed, the neighbors were so noisy and we could hear their arguments all night. 
The rooms are old, outdated and nothing nice - definitely not worth the amount we paid. 
We definitely won&apos;t be back."
1,"The service is Terrible. I understand that Covid is happening but it shouldn&apos;t take 2 and a half hours of standing in line to check in to our room.

Check in would have gone faster but the self check in ma Hines were down. On top of all this you couldn&apos;t even stand in one spot for too long because they had some kind of parade weaving through and I was continuously being told I needed to move."
5,"Super fun, and definetely something that you should try out. This was my second time in Vegas, but I had never gone out as much as I  had this time. Can&apos;t wait to come again."
4,"Our first room today has a very strong smell. Coming from a long drive to LA and thinking we&apos;re going to rest did not really happen. Definitely the former guests did not follow the non-smoking rule. 

I was on hold with the front desk for 15 minutes and decided to just go downstairs again and get another room. 

I&apos;m finally resting now with my family. The room is way better. The one we first got in the 18th floor. Cigarette butts found on the floor. It&apos;s like a casino smoke x 100."
5,Great experience and a best way to see the whole strip. I bought the $25 ticket to go to the observatory deck and was super amazed by the views. I think there&apos;s about 109 floors and two elevators going up and down. They&apos;re super fast and the elevator ride was casual. Hopefully get to come back soon!
1,They are racially profiling black males I have recording and a lawyer working the case
5,"I enjoyed my stay there after being in Bally&apos;s Las Vegas Hotel. The Strat Hotel has Restaurants, Attractions, Entertainment, Casino, &amp; an experience the Sky Pod."
1,Do not stay here.  I was here Super Bowl night and only one restaurant was open with a crappy menu.  The food wasn&apos;t good and they were considering closing immediately after the game was over.  I regret not staying at Palace Station.
5,My dtr got married this last weekend and I have to say the venue at the topside was amazing the orgazizer to the butler to the servers were all so impressive friendly professional and on point. Beautiful job while staff.
1,I&apos;m so sick of this place. I will never stay here again! Idgaf how cheap or how free a room is. They don&apos;t answer your phone calls when you call from the room. I have been calling several times to get towels and a do not disturb sign for my door! I got no one on the phone! They don&apos;t listen when ask for things you need! This place is trash and I will not be giving them a good review when they send me the survey. Also when you are charging people to stay in your hotel itemized your fees up front so people know what they are paying for.
3,So we tried again  and it was the pool for the win we had a good server! The food was good we brought our speaker and had a really good time
4,"Didn&apos;t stay at the hotel, but the observation tower is cool. I also liked the pizza place they have and the pineapple soda."
2,"Do not stay here. $40 HOTEL FEE?.. for what?!? 
Even if it was $1 for the room , if you include the &amp;40 fee it&apos;s Not worth it!! 
Customer Service could use some major work. 
The lobby was PACKED (COVID?!? Hello social distancing should have been better enforced and not allowed for huge lines) The line for check in 40 minutes after check in started was still extremely long. Some reviews say over an hour and I believe it!! We decided to just check in later instead which was a good move. 

Why have an express check in area that is not available for use?... That could have streamlined things. 

I added an extra Star because Micheal from the Bell Hop Desk was extremely helpful and patient. Thanks for your help and helping us move rooms when our first one smelled of Marijuana and Cigar, Even though we asked for a nonsmoking room. 
While the Hotel says It does not allow the use of Marijuana on it&apos;s property that is obviously not enforced. As the Front desk concierge kindly told me &quot;Well it&apos;s not illegal in Vegas&quot; 
-Which i know, but their hotel says it doesn&apos;t allow it?!? 
Word of advice Don&apos;t get a Standard room unless you want to feel like you&apos;re staying at a Motel 1 not even a Motel 6 Because of how trashy it is! 
I wish i would have taken pictures but it was wayy to horrendous to even stay in for a second longer."
1,"The WORST experience ever staying here. The service was bad, internet BAD, the walls are super thin. Towels from the floor tiles broken. Couldn&apos;t check in until hours after the schedule check in. JUST HORRIBLE! Never again!"
4,"Nice casino with a wide variety of shot machines and table games. 

My king room is weird with the window in the corner that doesn&apos;t face the bed. Can&apos;t actually see anything if I&apos;m on the bed. 

WiFi works and is decent. 

Coffee maker in the room is weird but it works. In-room safe. 

Could a little maintenance and upkeep though. Door for the space where the refrigerator is located is coming off it&apos;s hinge.  

And the refrigerator itself works but they need to defrost the freezer portion!"
5,"seriously have never felt so welcomed and comfortable. steve, randy, alan, nick and john thankyou so much!!!!"
3,"Been here dozens of times over the past twenty years.

I&apos;ve seen the renovations from two different owners.

It&apos;s now been rebranded as STRAT and they&apos;ve added more tables and machines.

They&apos;ve also revamped the food court with fancier options.

I didn&apos;t stay here but I&apos;d imagine the rooms look decent and probably have new furniture.

I remember the last time I actually stayed here my suite was spacious, clean and had vaulted ceilings.

I&apos;ll be back again for sure when visiting Vegas. 

With the closure of the failed Lucky Dragon Hotel I&apos;m sure the STRAT has missed out on some extra revenue."
