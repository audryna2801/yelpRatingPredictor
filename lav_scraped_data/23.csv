3,"With the Circus Circus you always see the many commercials that show the adventuredome that show the mighty roller coast that is a corkscrew loop that returns backwards . The glitter the lights and the many things that go on there doesn&apos;t give you the whole picture when you see the many times the commercials it gives the front of the hotel .
     When I had flown back last year the hotel has been going through many areas of remodeling that with the many towers that had remodeled and the rooms had be redone . When you fly into Las Vegas you will have to take an Airport Shuttle that will take you to Circus Circus the many taxis will charge you allot . That many hotels on the strip will charge high prices for there parking some will have free parking with you get what you find because with an Airport Shuttle they can take you right to the front door which they can help you unload so you can go in and get registered .
     The best advice that I can give is that when you book with a hotel is contact the Circus Circu directly with online you never know who you are dealing with and make sure things that are done correctly . When you arrive you go in through the double doors that have there you will see the large front desk area that has medium to large amount of desk clerks that are there to help with check in . The dark hardwoods and the colorful carpets that blend into the many lights that line lobby and the large areas of the casino gaming areas , many of the hotels that are going non smoking due to the Covid 19 pandemic to stem the tide . 
    With the Circus Circus Hotel you may see kids from time to time but kids are to be kept close by they are not allowed on the gambling floor when you travel through the hotel you will see many areas that many gaming machines and the many places that you can shop at . As you go through the main hotel showroom you see the many show acts that go on above you and they have ring area shows that entertain the many guests and the many restaurants that they have there . As you go through the main hotel you will see the main Adventuredome where you find the many big top games that are for kids with the many skee balls and the basket toss games . 
      They have several showrooms that are in the Adventuredome with circus acts that go on and the many games that you or your whole family will like that many games at the adventuredome are geared more towards the adults and those that are over 16 they do have a kids play area that can be more relaxing . And for the ladies they do have a large swimming polls that you can lounge by and when the evening comes that you can tackle the main buffet or the many other restaurants that are . When you have breakfast is get there early because the lines do form early the food they serve is very good that you will have mixture of many dishes .
       But with the pandemic that has tackled Las Vegas the many hotels have Implemented many rules of wearing masks when you check in and hand sanitizer is provided at many areas you can also use you own through the time you stay there . With the time you stay at the Circus Circus you can still have the fun you like is be safe when you have is social distance and wear a mask when you travel inside the hotel .
       Have a great time and be safe you still have many more things to see around Las Vegas have a great trip ."
4,"I am updating my review because well I went here to go and gamble.  Yes the place looks the same as it did back when I wrote the review 10 years ago.  However, why the 4 stars because they you come out a big winner the review goes up even more as I ended up coming out $430 dollars richer. I only played for an 2 hours here and only on a few of the machines, Jin Long 88 as I got 5 spins on both of the machines, the Flinstones, Bamboo Panda, Plinko and coin slots.  You can play the quarter slots if you want to and the dollar coin slots if you want to see what was like gambling in the 90&apos;s.

Here is the bad about this place:
Well the rewards center was closed and it was still early when I went here to gamble like at 7pm.  Only half of the slots are opened.  Slots of Fun is closed for some reason, but the machines are all on, but security guard is there.  Adventure dome is closed for 4 days, so check the calendar. $40 dollars is a lot for unlimited rides compared to what we paid 20 years ago for $26 dollars, now thinking about it, not too bad considering inflation and the time spent in the amusement park is cheaper than gambling. The place looks run down and needs a really good renovation.  There are family shops, but when I went walking around the adventure dome it was dead and for some reason the massage parlor was opened.  I was playing Pokemon Go and this random lady came up to me and asked me if I wanted one.

The good on this place:
When you come out a winner everything changes.  I wished I played here more.  Unfortunately, the rewards was closed so I am superstitious of without gambling without a card, otherwise they might have had a chance to get my money back.  They have a great selection of games believe it or not that other casinos do not have.  I went to a lot of casinos to check out he machines

1. Flintstones Return to Bedrock,  my favorite machine 10 years ago, I won 60 dollars the first night off a 60 cent bet but I gave it back though the next day trying to chase the bonus

2.  Willy Wonka Pure Imagination

3. Monopoly, I never played that version

4.  Coin slots - where you put quarters and dollar coins into the machine. The dollars are 97.3% payback rate which is nice.

They have the newer machines like Wheel of Fortune, Jin Long 88, I ended up winning big on the machine in just 30 minutes of playing and 5 bonuses which was something unheard of.  Plinko,  I ended up getting 2 bonuses there. Buffalo Gold, Buffalo Revolution.  It is a great mixture of games.  You will not find the Spinning Fortunes or Wonder Wheel or even Lightning Link however.

I wished I gambled here more though and played some of the old machines."
3,"Circus Circus isn&apos;t all the bad. It isn&apos;t all that good either.

Pros:
-Midway and Adventuredome are a lot of fun. The kids love these areas but they are just as fun for adults too. You won&apos;t leave without a prize.
-Cheap but you get what you pay for

Cons:
-Too far from the action on the strip. It is a long walk or an Uber/taxi ride to the action on the strip
-It is a little run down, which gives the appearance of being dirty.
-Not a lot of food options - especially sit down dining; COVID hours just make dining options worse
-No frig, microwave, or coffee maker in the room"
5,"I read the horrible Circus Circus reviews but I  took a risk and booked  with them.  Trust and believe.... I am happy that I did! 
Our room was located in the West Towers 21st floor (Room #21814). It was spacious,  CLEAN, and quiet. 

 Housekeeping was phenomenal... extra soft pillows and tons of white  fresh towels.  Our room, hotel hallway, elevators  smelled  just like  strawberries  (car scent).

The staff at the Circus Circus  Buffet  were polite  and sweet.  The Pizzeria restaurant was my  favorite.....the pizza was &quot;smack yo momma&quot; good! I especially enjoyed  the cashier named TAMMIE ....she was hilarious and kind.

One  night... we ordered Room Service &quot;bucket of chicken with mashed  potatoes&quot; ooooooo weeeeeee... that was delicious fried chicken.... I was  surprised beyond belief. 

The Adventure Park , and Arcade were fun. I enjoyed the clay face sculptures made by artists for  $19.99.... BRILLANT IDEA!

The  Water park was refreshing and relaxing.... and so was the bucket  of  ice cold STELLAS! The kids and I also devoured the freshly made potatoe  French fries, and Nachos.... yumyum status. 

The casinos were  clean, spacious and hardly smelled of cigarettes.... despite the golden  girls huffin and puffin as  they played the slot machines.

Long story short.... I would book another weekend at the Circus Circus Hotel.... in a heartbeat. 

Circus  Circus is not outdated.... plain and simple... some have this insane  taste of steak &amp;  lobster ... ON A MCDONALD&apos;S HAPPY MEAL BUDGET! 
 
My experience at Circus Circus Hotel  was 10+"
1,"&quot;Magic Art Tattoo&quot; is a vender inside circus circus (I&apos;m commenting on the actual hotel due to the face they continue to have this shady business despite all the negative reviews and even other vendors and staff and security were shocked to the problem I had today.. I blame circus circus for not having proper professional businesses inside If I could give this place a 0. I would maybe just plain &quot;negative&quot; . The African American girl with long braids (didn&apos;t get her name nor did she mention it) was quoting &quot;$20&quot; tattoos.. so yea sure me and my brother and family 4 people got a tattoo thinning it will be $80 ended up being $500 dollars. COMPLETE JOKE. Then this uneducated rude female tried to say we were &quot;running&quot; when we actually found a security and reported it ourself for being ridiculously overpriced and want nothing to do with it. Girl don&apos;t be mad cause your stuck drawing on peoples hand making probably $10 an hour.. like very rude.. NOWHERE in the store are the &quot;prices&quot; listed not even on the pictures.. nor does she mention prices or even confirm them for you. She&apos;s shady as can be. DONT GO HERE SAVE YOUR MONEY YOU CAN GET A REAL TATTOO FOR THE PRICES THEY WANT HERE..


Go to Caesars palace. Way better &amp; better treatment for PAYING CUSTOMERS"
4,"We used to come here when my kids were young, they like the amusement park.  We cold turn them loose in there and hit the slots.  The upstairs with the carnival games is a fun place too.  Be prepared to drop a bunch of $$ up there, but that is what you do in vegas, right?

The rooms were renovated maybe 10 years ago I think.  They did a decent job.  The casino feels tired.  Little kiosks of trinkets.  Older machines.  Very little in the way of tables.  Lots of people dragging their children through the casino in the middle of the night.  The pool is ok.  This is nothing like the big casinos.

This is good for what it is but not for an adults only group.  If you want to bring kids to Las Vegas this is the place for you."
5,"Best deal on the strip! $1 hot dogs and beers.

Come into slots a fun right next to the east exit."
2,"Used to live in Vegas, tried the $4.99 buffet.  A word of advice, never eat at a $4.99 buffet.  The food was decent, but the after-effects of the $4.99 buffet are not pleasant.  It is however, an excellent weight loss because you will have voided anything that has been lingering in your bowels, you will weigh much less when you are finished!"
1,The rooms looks nothing like the picture. My tv didn&apos;t work and I asked for someone to fix it and it took them forever to come. If it wasn&apos;t for the fact my money was non refundable I would of left right then. The front desk staff is cold and unwelcoming. This was a big let down because circus circus in reno is awesome. I was expecting it to be better and it actually looked like a run down motel 6 off the freeway. I&apos;m so disappointed in this
1,"HELL NOO!!!! If your planning to go to vegas and gamble, Circus Circus is not the place to go unless you dont mind giving them all your money without getting anything back. Not even a little.
Circus Circus is a Vampire!!!! This place will suck the blood out your veins if it could. 
Its under new ownership, and Im guessing the man 
Is broke after paying billions for the place.
The place still looks the same, Dirty and run down, 
Waitresses look like they&apos;re on drugs.
They have new slots, but none pay out.
I will no longer be coming and or staying here anymore, and I do not recommend anyone else to either. I think they should shut it down!!!!!
Worse Casino in Vegas. This review has 1 star, but it doesn&apos;t even deserve that. But I had to give it a star in order to post. AVOID this casino as much as possible"
3,Came to Vegas on jan 1st bought our 2 night stay threw Priceline as it had the best price for a last second trip. Walking in there was security and he had mask in case you didn&apos;t have 1 and also was doing Temperature checks for people staying in the hotel ( not like that matters because regular guest didn&apos;t have to do temps only guest of hotel) got up to our room on the 28th floor and noticed immediately the room was very clean but super outdated. There&apos;s a huge lack of electricity sockets which is a big bummer and no mini fridge which would he nice to have. Over all employees we ran into were very joe and accommodating. Thanks for the fun stay but next time I&apos;ll pick somewhere else to stay.
1,"A recent stay at this establishment resulted in theft, loss of vacation time, money and major inconvenience due to lack of good customer service.
Our stay was from 22-24 November 2020 (conf#010r8p58Oa, 010HFyPgjH).
After checking in and having the hotel bell staff take our luggage up, my cell phone came to be missing. It showed up on our google tracking to be on the property, even though it was not in my possession after hours of searching for it and calling it. A claim and statement was made with security once we determined the phone had been taken, and because of my line of business, I had to purchase a brand new phone the following day which took up a majority of the day. The hotel&apos;s risk department has not been in contact with us at all despite multiple phone calls and voice mails left by myself and my husband.

In addition to dealing with the theft, the hotel&apos;s housekeeping services lacked greatly as well as the staff in the Adventure Dome when we attempted to remedy an already disappointing vacation for our children and the kiosk failed and had to wait on them to fix the situation, without any apology. When all of these issues were brought up in check-out, there was no service recovery attempt from any management, security or staff otherwise.
They have refused to accept accountability for this situation and I do not suggest anyone stay here."
3,"This Hotel had great rates, but that&apos;s about it. We got two rooms and in one the sink didn&apos;t work. In our second room there was trash under the edge of the bed, and used socks. 

 If you stay here make sure you bring your own hand sanitizer because we didn&apos;t see one dispenser in the hotel or casino. The elevators are horrible because they need you room key card and half the time the cards don&apos;t read properly."
4,"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times, and though it&apos;s not the Venetian or Wynn, it serves it&apos;s purpose. Most of the rooms as well as the casino areas have had a recent upgrade. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and the remodel has refreshed them considerably.
The casino area looks newer as well, and offers plenty of gaming action. The restaurants aren&apos;t going to wow you, but they aren&apos;t horrible either, well maybe the buffet is, but most of the other dining options are adequate.
Yes it is family and budget friendly, so yes there are lot&apos;s of kids running around, yet I find them far less annoying than many of their so called adult counterparts.
Overall this is a fine enough place to stay in Vegas, only drawback it is a bit away from the nicer parts of the strip."
1,"Total run down washed up casino and a rip-off. I&apos;ve only been staying there on and off over the last few years because I had built up some comps playing there when I was staying nearby and just stayed loyal as they didn&apos;t charge me resort fees on my free rooms. 

I hadn&apos;t been in 2020 due to the pandemic but I was assured if I came back my rooms would be free and front desk would remove resort fees. Sure enough it was bait and switch and the run around. They referred me to their players club there. They passed the buck there too and said nobody was available to help me. 

I got tired of their games so I used up all my free play and comps and did not spend even an extra penny gambling I went elsewhere I can prove that too I have comps at other casinos. Way to go Circus Circus you just lost a loyal customer who spent thousands over the years just to collect a measly resort fee! 

Place really needs to be condemned and emploded. It smells funny and has piles of low class loud people that stay there. About the only sort of decent thing there oddly enough is a decent steakhouse."
2,"Rooms need remodeling ASAP ,great place for kids to enjoy but rooms need tlc ASAP
Casino is good entertainment is good"
1,Hour and a half waiting in line to check in..Beds are horribly thin... Key cards only work half the time... Vending machine didn&apos;t work...AC in my room didn&apos;t work at all... I was scheduled to stay 2 nights I checked out after one night early in the AM... it was just that bad
1,"Reserved a spot in the RV park called twice to have questions answered never said anything about it closing at 5 at the office for RV space. I called booked the space I then had to go into the hotel and &quot;checkin&quot; for the space. Took me 30 minutes to find the lobby. Had to ask several people where it was. Then I had to argue with the lady at the desk about the space I was in. Had to change spaces argued about it being a open space. It then took me almost 30 minutes to find my way out of the hotel. Also cell service is none working As in no service anywhere in the hotel. 

Wish I could get my money back and go elsewhere"
3,It was my first time ever staying here. They had so much cool stuff inside I didn&apos;t realize it was so big. They have a theme zone rides and the line was super long didn&apos;t get to experience that. But so many gift shops and food places. They have a place to get tshirts airbrushed old school which I thought was so freakn cool. We stayed on the 12th floor room was ordinary nothing special. They really didn&apos;t have many things like a refrigerator or a coffee maker which sucked cause we both wanted coffee lol. The ice maker wasn&apos;t working neither was the vending machine which sucked
4,"New owner. Post pandemic Covid-19, less slot machines. Midway games open till 9pm. Cleaners all over the area. But, definitely less people than before. Las Vegas is only a week open. Slots Fun next door is just as the same. The food and gift shop is close early. 6-9-2020"
