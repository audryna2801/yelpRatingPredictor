4,"I visit Vegas 2-4 times a years and love to explore the off strip/off downtown casino&apos;s.  This one is a little gem.  It&apos;s a smaller casino but I found the mix of classic to new slots satisfying.  They actually had a couple old slots I enjoyed playing in the past - I Dream of Jeanne for one.  

What I loved most though was how friendly everyone was.  The players club/cashier is the same area.  I was able to partake in a free spin after earning 300 points, which is basically $1/point.  Since I&apos;m a max better, that didn&apos;t take long to hit.  I found the machines paid off fairly well.  For an example, to earn 300 point, it cost me $20.  I think earned $25 of free play and a free mug.  

They have various contests/drawings that are geared more towards local&apos;s, but that OK.  They have a drawing Saturday for some major free play that you have to be present to win.  However, since I won&apos;t be in town, I would still get $25 free play for winning.  A nice little touch some other casino&apos;s don&apos;t do.  

If you&apos;re looking for a little more intimate action away from the hectic energy of the strip, this casino isn&apos;t that far off the path for a visit."
3,"I give this little casino 3 stars. Nothing wrong with it though as far as slots go, if your a slot player this is a good place to go. I think that this is more of a local hangout than a place tourists. I&apos;m not a slot player, I&apos;m a Blackjack player and this casino only has slot machines. 

It is located a few blocks off the strip on Sahara (east of the strip). It&apos;s in kind of a not so nice area. There is not and entrance to the casino in the front off Sahara, you have to go around back which is where the parking is. 

Inside there is a restaurant called Fat Choy and it was really busy. I didn&apos;t eat there but it must be good because of the crowd. There is a bar I. The casino as well.

The crowd in side was older and it was quite smoky inside. They have some of the older slot machines as well as some newer modern ones. My wife enjoys the slots and some of the older ones I think are more fun. 

So in the end I think it&apos;s an ok locals spot. The area isn&apos;t great but I think with the massive development in and around the intersection of Sahara and Las Vegas Blvd. this area will clean up a bit. If I ever come back it will be to try Fat Choy."
1,"My experience with this casino at first was a good experience. The wait staff and bartenders were very courteous, and kept the drinks flowing. The 2nd time I went there the staff seemed to ignore me while I played on any of their games. The last time I went there, my experience was completely terrible! They wouldn&apos;t give me even a soda drink without putting at least $10.00 in their machine and when I asked for water the gave me what tasted like bad well water. Finally I decided to put ten in the machine and thought they would give me a drink. There was 2 bartenders on staff and I was the only customer but they didn&apos;t even ask me if I wanted one. My girlfriend had a similar experience with the waitress drink server. She took her order and then ignored her for twenty minutes until she walked u to the bar and looked at her as she was talking with other staff. She claimed oh I forgot. We left immediately. Being treated like that was quite rude!"
2,It&apos;s right on busy Sahara street on the east side the neighborhood is really bad and the patrons armed much better. It&apos;s really small but they have a good restaurant called Mr Choy and a bsr but if your a tourist better off going to the strip. The gambling limits are low so that&apos;s good
1,Turn out to look like a gay place. Security asking for id after going there for years some bull shit place turn out to be never going back
3,"I&apos;ve driven by the Eureka Casino countless times in the many, many years that I have lived in this town. Today was actually the very first time that I actually parked the car and walked in!

- The inside is pretty much as small as you would think it is, judging by the outside. Pretty much one of the smallest casinos I&apos;ve ever stepped foot in.
- Casino was much cleaner and looked much better than I was anticipating. Don&apos;t know why I was expecting the worst, but it wasn&apos;t that bad.
- Security guy working the door was friendly and opening the door for patrons.
- The only reason I stopped here was to experience the Fat Choy Restaurant inside. (See separate review) This is why you need to stop by this place!
- Small bar, no table games, only slots here
- I see a lot of people complained about how smokey it was, but I guess I got lucky. I really don&apos;t think it was too bad. Trust me, as a non smoker, if I thought it was bad I would say so.

Honestly, I only see myself coming here to eat at Fat Choy, but maybe one of these times I&apos;ll grab a drink and throw a $20 in a machine just to see what happens. 

3 stars.

A-OK."
1,"I am 82 years old and just had the worst breakfast in my life at the coffee shop. The hash browns and the omelet were saturated with grease.
However, the service and coffee were very good.
Poker Room here is very good but slot reward system payout is also the worst I have seen.
Gregory Restaurant has an early bird special that is very good and very reasonable."
4,"Over the River and Through the Woods to Auntie&apos;s House We Go...

That&apos;s how I felt as I drove east on Sahara to drop off Christmas gifts from my cousins for my Auntie.  I had seen Eureka Casino before,  but somehow, this time it clicked that this was the casino that housed the Fat Choy restaurant!

This tiny casino is a quaint older one on the right side of Sahara as you drive east from the Strip, on the corner of Sherwood. There&apos;s free parking in the back of the stand alone building. The front entrance has been closed off,  so everyone enters from the parking lot. 

Inside,  you&apos;ll find the regular selection of video games and slot machines. The restrooms are clean and functional. There&apos;s a nice bar and an excellent restaurant named &quot;Fat Choy&quot;, known for its American Asian Fusion cuisine. 

Eureka Casino is off the beaten path,  so don&apos;t expect the sterile efficiency of the high end newer casinos.  Instead, come here and experience the unique &quot;Eureka&quot;! feeling of days past when hospitality and old-fashioned courtesy still live on...  The staff are awesome here!"
4,"Really super nice environment,, Beautiful small casino, Not much going on. Manager walked around and asked how we were. Nice but no cocktail service at slots, I think they want you to go to bar to order a drink? 

Overall, nice place."
5,"Great place to have a drink off strip but close to the strip. My own personal gem. If you are just looking for a place to relax, play some slots, or just have good conversation, this is the place to go. Excellelent clientele and service."
1,"Just had a really bad experience at this little dump and I am actually really pretty up set about it. I&apos;ve been going in there for over 2 and a half years between 3 to 4 times a week . I love, love love, Fat Choy the restaurant located inside. FYI if you have never been, go now and I mean right now! The food is awesome and the service is almost always great.   So after stopping in this evening to get my favorite sandwich, the ShortRib Grilled Cheese (OMG that sandwich is the bomb and no joke!)  If you&apos;re  ever in the neighborhood, make it point to stop in at Fat Choy. Believe me you will thank me!  But if you put so much as a nickel in one of those old broken down 1970 machines, you are dead to me. 
Anyway back to that nasty old hole of a casino. After I had finished eating, I went out to the casino area to wait for a friend who had just left work and was going to swing by and togeher we&apos;re going to go hit up Fashion Show.  
Shortly after sitting down I was approached  and told I need  leave because, and I am quoting here. &quot;You need to  leave the Casino.&quot;  I must have had  that look of: &quot;are messing with me, &quot; that moved quickly to &quot;come on man, don&apos;t  mess with me like that&quot;.   Because then he just flat out &quot;If you ain&apos;t putting money into the machines, you need to leave...NOW!&quot; And to be honest there was still a part of me that was looking around for  the hidden camera.   Look I get it, and completely understand that they are first and foremost a gambling establishment and that is how they make their money. And as a person who does not gamble but still trying to be considerate of that, I chose chair at a group of 6 machines that had absolutely no one using any of the machines. Thinking I could sit and wait for my friend.  Also,  I could even understand being asked to stand  or go to the bar area if they were really busy and  people were waiting in line for a machines .  But there seriously only about 20 people in the whole place and  most of them were sitting at the bar where they could see the TV.   So, as someone who not going to be a source of revenue I figured I was being respctful  and doing the right thing. But apparantly at the Eureka it is a very big NO NO, and... &quot;if you ain&apos;t feeding the machine, you got to go, NOW!&quot; 
 It&apos;s  odd that I have lived here in Las Vegas for coming up on 8 years and have been in  and out of gaming establishments all over the valley,  all without ever gambling in them and have never  never had a single problem. 
I could usually very easily find a way to contribute to their bottom line either through food, drinking, or other types of entertainment.  But here at the Eureka it is apparantly either  Feed the machine or GTFO.  So I say stay away from this hole of a casino, it&apos;s a little rinky dink operation,  with outdated machines,  that if you listen to what some people say,  I are some of the tighest you&apos;re going to come across.
Also, if you do make it in to grab some  bomb ass Fat Choy,  watch out for the dorky little Asian manager in the cheap suit, he likes following dudes into the restroom.  So to him I&apos;ll  say what I have wanted to say for months,  &quot;Hey man you really got to cut that crap out, it&apos;s weird and  makes you look like a complete and total perv&quot;.  Even a few of the employees  have started to notice and are getting a little creeped out."
5,This is my all time favorite local bar!! We&apos;ve been coming here for years! Super friendly staff and great food at Fat Choy too!! That&apos;s the restaurant inside of the Eureka
3,"This is a tiny casino off Sahara Ave, and we only went there was to visit Fat Choy inside.  There does not seem to be a hotel attached to it like the casinos on strip.  The parking lot is a bit tiny for casino and was hidden behind the building.  They always seem to have one big guy at the door opening it for you.  It was filled with mostly slot machine.  

I guess Eureka was a change from glittery scene on the Strip, it could be a great spot to hangout and have some nice fusion Chinese food."
3,"Some quick facts about the Eureka from the web:

- Eureka Casino is the only Asian American owned/operating casino in Las Vegas.

- Eureka is the original neighborhood casino, operating since the early 1960&apos;s, without a single day of closure.

- They are located 5 blocks east of the Las Vegas strip on Sahara and just a couple minutes away from Downtown Las Vegas. 

- In Eureka Casino&apos;s original build out, the space that Fat Choy restaurant now occupies, was the parking lot.

So, a bunch of neat trivia to know and impress your friends with while entertaining yourself in front of the many slot machines in this tiny casino.  The air quality is not the best, but is still better than many of the other local casinos.  The staff here are friendly, security opens doors for guests as you leave. 

It is not glitzy like the mega resorts on the Strip, but it is an A-OK spot to spend a few hours hanging out or getting some surprisingly good food at the Fat Choy restaurant on premise."
2,"This was my first time to the Eureka and I&apos;ll be back to eat at Fat Choy but I won&apos;t be sitting and playing any of the machines.  The smoke in the casino is heavy and you just need to walk through it to get to Fat Choy.

It&apos;s a locals kind of joint and I wonder how it continues to operate.  There&apos;s not much to recommend this place except the convenient parking in the back.

Put up some doors and close off Fat Choy from the smoke--please!"
2,"The only redeeming quality about this casino is the restaurant, Fat Choy. But even that fell a little short of my expectations. Otherwise, this casino is a smoky room full of slots with a large bar in the back. 

Service is okay, security is present, but there are no table games or anything else that justifies this place being open- it&apos;s easy to park here because there&apos;s no one inside. I don&apos;t understand how this place stays open."
2,"Haven&apos;t been to Eureka Casino??  Well, you&apos;re not missing much.  Eureka Casino is not located in the best part of Las Vegas and it is one of those dive casinos.  Not much here except smoke, loitering, small bar, and slot machines.  Eureka is literally the size of a 7-Eleven. The only reason for me to stop in here is for Fat Choy&apos;s, which has delicious Short Rib Grilled Cheese.  

I will be back only for Fat Choy&apos;s.  Otherwise, I really don&apos;t see myself going out here to kick it."
5,Been going here for more than 15 years.. small casino where the employees know everyone and treat you like family...some idiot people like Mike A come along and make up lies because they don&apos;t want to follow rules/guidelines that casinos adopt and he takes it out personally on the employee.  Been going here for maapny years and never saw anything abnormal like Mike A reports...he should be shunned...
1,"Slot machines are not good. That&apos;s a money eating machine, very hungry. Don&apos;t go over there to play."
4,"This place is divey for sure, but to me that&apos;s a part of the charm. It&apos;s pretty smokey but it&apos;s a casino, what do you expect? I&apos;ve always received excellent service here. I agree with everyone who mentioned the Fat Choy being the highlight of this casino. The people watching in the wee hours of the morning is definitely worth mentioning. The security is very good and always keeps an eye on my bike whenever I&apos;m there."
