4,"The MGM Grand looks pretty much the same as it did when I stayed here many years ago. I&apos;m going to say 3.5 stars but round up to 4. I got a good deal to stay here so I decided to do that. The hotel was included with the flight and I received an extra night for free. Overall, the staff was friendly and helpful. They had a hard time locating my reservation but it was eventually found in their system under my bf&apos;s name. It was a weird  situation. 
Another thing...they let us check in earlier than 3 pm without an extra cost. You have to pay some tourist tax fee of over a hundred dollars. I knew about that already. Another thing I didn&apos;t like was that they took out a $300 deposit in case we buy water or snacks in the room or...I guess end up destroying it. There are also sodas and alcohol in the fridge. The thing doesn&apos;t even open! I&apos;m not willing to pay $18 for a bottle of a water. There&apos;s a CVS and Walgreens down the street. There&apos;s also a vending machine in the hallway. The water and snacks are $3 and change there. Luckily, I&apos;ll be getting that deposit back.
The room was spacious and comfy enough for us. I don&apos;t need a lot of amenities or extravagant things, especially when I&apos;m out gambling, eating, etc. most of the time. It was just a basic room with two comfy queen size beds, the usual stuff. The walls are a little bit thin, though. My neighbors all around were probably in their early 20&apos;s and partying it up. They were loud and most likely drunk at 2 or 3 am. I remember those days so it didn&apos;t bother me that much. I brought my music and headphones so I was able to tune most of it out. Would I stay here again? Maybe. It all depends on the cost. Las Vegas has tons of options. The room was nice and comfy enough. There&apos;s also a lot of slots and food options downstairs. It was super clean and everyone that I&apos;ve seen is wearing their masks. Hand sanitizer and masks were provided in the room. Room service is also available."
5,"Very nice hotel and resort! The line might be long every now and then but they&apos;re very nice in the front desk. It goes by fast so the wait time is not too bad. The front desk guy gave us a free upgrade so that was nice. We just had to pay for the resort fee which is all normal. 
They have free masks by the entrance. If you stay here, you get a free goodie bag as well with 2 free masks (1 for me &amp; 1 for my husband), 1 hand sanitizer and 1 small bag. It&apos;s cute. Very thoughtful of them.
Place is clean. There&apos;s additional cleansing air they put around so it&apos;s cleaner. I like how they added extra security for the card in the elevator to specific room and floor a person stays. 
Walking destination to many places. The room rates/price is great! Not expensive and very affordable. Enjoyed our stay here and planning to be back soon. I totally Recommend"
4,"I stayed at the MGM Signature Hotel and it was a pretty awesome experience despite 90% of the casino and starbucks locations being completely closed on a Wednesday and Thursday.

I strolled around the casino several times and my first evening I was able to dine in at Wolfgang Pucks Grill restaurant and it was a pleasant relief that they were open-- even for walk-ins.

I didn&apos;t make reservations because I didn&apos;t know they even existed in this casino but they seated us anyway. 

The next morning I was able to get coffee at Johnny Rockets who also does breakfast which was a relief since most of the starbucks except for 1 was totally shut down. 

I enjoyed walking and getting in some steps inside the casino and also enjoyed seeing more people as the weekend started to roll in-- it reminded me of how Vegas normally was before Covid. 

I think things are starting to look up and get better and soon beautiful Vegas will be up and running in no time! 

As for MGM-- it was a beautiful vacation and their suites were amazing, comfortable and very affordable. 

If you haven&apos;t been here yet-- it&apos;s a must! 
2 thumbs up for the beautiful MGM!"
3,"I stayed here during the weekend of Feb 19th  

There was some professional fights being hosted here are the MGM 

I Have stayed here many many times, from regular standard rooms to executive suites to the MGM signature 

I particularly like to stay here during fight nites the energy is lit!!  I have stayed on the same floor as other celebrities and boxers ect 

This weekend particularly was no exception.  Even though they did not allow any fans in the arena.  

My room was clean and very comfortable. I drew myself a nice hot bath   Omg the water ran hot!!  LOVE IT

My view from the room was not so good. It was a view of the parking lot  BUMMER"
1,"DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!!! 

I&apos;ll try to keep this as to the point as possible : 

I included photos of a few spots we were able to hit during Covid since mostly everything is closed or has limited seating. From MGM you can actually walk through the casino floor and out the back of the hotel to the Las Vegas Strip. We didn&apos;t know there was a shortcut until we had walked the longer way three times and had taken 2 taxi trips. These photos are places that are within walking distance from the MGM Hotel on the strip. From MGM to the strip you will pay about $11-$15 with a tip via Taxi. There are no shuttles right now. So rent a car if you don&apos;t want to do the walking thing. If it&apos;s nice weather we recommend walking because the traffic isn&apos;t the best. There is still a bus but I didn&apos;t want to ride inside of a closed bus that was FULL. 

The room: 

Was terrible. The furniture was old and worn. The bathroom had rust in more than one place. The sink AND shower did not drain so between showers we literally had to wait for the water to go down. Carpet wasn&apos;t the cleanest and the mini fridge was HOT to touch. We had to call down to the front desk for more than one reason (I&apos;ll get to that). We had a 4 day stay ... they gave us 1 set of towels for two people and when I asked for more we were given 2. We shower everyday.. not sure about others but mmmk, We had to call down because the thermostat was on 80 and blowing cold air like a motel 6. Whew. 

Two doors down we witnessed a domestic violence situation. Called for help since I thought .. maybe the female would be murdered and they put me on hold... after I told them what was going on THEY CALLED THE ROOM as opposed to coming to see what was going ON. So, I&apos;m sure he was smothering her while he talked to the front desk and told them everything was ok. We left (I was so scared to leave her there but I mean I can&apos;t get involved in domestic disputes .. innocent bystanders get killed trying to help) WHEN WE RETURNED she was on the phone in the hallway nude. 

If you are looking for a young crowd that&apos;s rolling around the hotel in handicapped carts and screaming.. playing tag.. I mean.. you found the right place! We are all for a good time but .. not like this. You can tell they room all of the same kind of people in the same parts or the hotel .. it&apos;s obvious. 

The room service bill for breakfast was about $100 for two people . I had steak, potatoes and eggs with a mimosa.. 3 stars and that&apos;s because of the alcohol otherwise 1. My husband had pancakes, sausage etc traditional breakfast and enjoyed his meal. 

There is a Hooters across the street you can get food at for dinner if needed. Everything in Vegas requires a reservation because of Covid and the capacity limitations so call and book ahead and make sure you use a &quot;good last name&quot; (read between the lines) because if not ... &quot;we are full&quot; is all you will hear. 

Masks were worn on the strip for the most part unless people were smoking or drinking of course. You will see people with the tall slushy drinks you can get them at the daiquiri shop or Fat Tuesday. Fat Tuesday is cheaper . You purchase the size you want and can add shots for an extra $2-$3 per shot. 

There is a chick fil a on the strip. If you like cheese on your food keep walking because they don&apos;t have it. 

Planet Hollywood was cool to walk through nothing major - again all the restaurants need reservations or you can wait to be seated. I hope this review helped. We will probably stay at the Bellacio next time - IF we come back.. won&apos;t be for as long. 

Oh there&apos;s a lit part of the strip that&apos;s busy..music.. drinks.. lots of ppl.. Target.. Marshall&apos;s.. Ross.. across from your LV, Gucci etc.. that was fun .. lol 

Overall- all things considered WE had a great time because when you go with great people you always find fun things to do."
3,"I&apos;m an MGM player so I get all my hotel rooms free...  and this was a &quot;tower spa suite&quot;.    It just wasn&apos;t all that.  

I appreciate all they did to make it Covid clean.  But I just wasn&apos;t that impressed with the service or amenities.  I guess I always thought the MGM was way better than my usual haunts (NY or Luxor), but it just isn&apos;t.  

It&apos;s probably hard to judge a place during Covid, but there just isn&apos;t much going on at the MGM Grand now.  Dining options (especially during the day) are just non-existent.  The staff seemed to have no idea what was open so getting recommendations was impossible.  Places that are listed as open (Cabana Grill) are in fact NOT open and you won&apos;t know that until you walk the mile to get there...  no one can tell you and the website may SAY a place is open but it isn&apos;t.

There also isn&apos;t much to see at MGM Grand.  Our room was fine - comfy bed and nice spa tub.  The slot machine selection is OK.   I did find that their drink service while you&apos;re playing is very good.  Probably the best at any of the MGM properties I stay at.  

Room service is more readily available but very pricey - a $9 charge for any order and the menu is pretty limited.  But it&apos;s nice to sleep in and order food - too many casino hotels aren&apos;t doing room service now.  

If you want to leave the hotel and grab a cab or Uber/Lyft you have to do a bit of a hike and they don&apos;t really tell you that...  the signs are sort of deceptive (you&apos;re only one floor away from your ride!)...  it&apos;s actually a bit of a walk so don&apos;t call a car until you&apos;re there...  it&apos;s not nearly as convenient as it is at other properties.   

Staff was friendly.  We loved the Lobby Bar and when my SO found his cash-out ticket stuck in the machine we got help pretty quickly.  But I have a choice of MGM properties to stay at and I just can&apos;t see the MGM Grand being one we would be in a hurry to go back to."
3,"This hotel is significantly cheaper than most places on the strip. And of course, you get what you pay for. Because of the cheap price, I will review accordingly. 

The walls are very thin in this buidling. You can hear almost everything that is going on in the room next to you and in the hall ways. So it may be a hit or miss. Depending if you get a loud people on your floor or not.

Aside from that, I must say the walking distance to parking garge to check in desk to hotel elevator is very close togheter. 

Staff here is courterous and polite. Hard to find a place in vegas that doesn&apos;t have great customer service. 

I would probably not stay here again just because of the thin walls. Just really annoying to be waken up by noise in the hall way or room next room over repeatly. Definitely led to some lack of sleep and tireness for this stay."
1,"Wow!!! What happened to this place ?? 
20 years ago we used to come here and it was the hot spot. Now it&apos;s become a second world country. 
It&apos;s depressing, ghetto, dingy and sad. 
MGM Grand is that 65 year old actor that had a hit movie 20 years ago and is hanging on to its golden years only in memory. 
NEVER AGAIN ... 
and valet service is discontinued too"
2,The hotel is nice but very out dated. The wall paper the room was coming off and as well in some parts in the hallway. The air conditioner unit was barley working and the bathtub was not draining. There&apos;s no refrigerator or safe in the room. The MGM Signature is much better hotel. The MGM needs to be revamped.
1,"This casino along with their other properties charges you a &quot;Resort fee&quot; this hotel being $44.00 for a resort that is not open for the season. When I asked the hotel operator what I&apos;m getting for my $44.00 the operator was speachless.
That should be illegal! Being charged for something your not receiving is a crime."
3,"This was my first time staying at MGM out of my many Vegas trips over the years.  After this long 5 day stay, i can confidently say this would not be my hotel of choice.  It is definitely a nice hotel and very large but here is my experience at MGM...

  Check-in process was very quick and easy.  $200 refundable deposit is required as well as daily resort fees. Which for 5 days was about another $200.
Upon checking in, we were told we had a $20 dining credit per day to spend at a hotel restaurant in MGM. 
You scan a barcode at the front desk that pulls up a list of what is supposed to be eligible restaurants.  Welp we found that is not the case, most of the restaurants are closed and then the other half are third party and can&apos;t charge to the room (that&apos;s how we had to use the dining credit) so we got to use the credit one day and that was it. So pretty pointless and not really explained well at the front desk.
   Even though the hotel is extremely large it seemed they were only checking in guests on floors 21-29 and not really utilizing the other floors. I say this because once the weekend came, the wait to just get on the elevators  was 10-20 minutes because there were so many people trying to get up at the same time.  Meanwhile the elevators to the other floors were empty so not sure what was up with that.  The room was large and clean.  The hotel even leaves a mask and sanitation kit in the room.  Mini bar was open and fully stocked. Masks are required pretty much at every single moment. My mask wasn&apos;t covering just the tip of my nose and i got asked to pull it up.  They are not playing around at all. 
  For me, location is everything.  I like to stay centralized on The Strip because everything is right there and can easily walk to any place on the strip and go back to your room at anytime.   Well MGM is literally soooo far down the strip and on those late drunk nights it is not fun to walk all the way back to your hotel.  It&apos;s about a good 30 minute walk from the heart of the strip so we did way more walking than usual this time around."
5,Casino was nice and the deserts in this place were real good. Nice we got free parking so we parked here and walked the strip to m&amp;m world and Hersheys world. Will take a stroll around here again.
4,"This is my second time on their dime, so to speak. The first time my wife and I stayed, mid October 2020, we had a very nice room. We also won a ton of money playing slots. A large number of restaurants were closed so the food choices were limited at best, but was adequate. The hotel was suffering from low turnout.

Just arrived home from our second trip and it&apos;s just sad. The staff is great, they comped us a really pretty suit. They are trying to keep a good upbeat image but the property was almost deserted! Seen Sci-Fi movies that depict this city as empty, for God&apos;s sakes its CES week, a room at MGM should not be available! The staff said they weren&apos;t at 15% of capacity, I&apos;m surprised if it&apos;s 10%. Consequently, nobody was winning anything. Their trying but until COVID is mitigated there is little hope for gaming fun. Great place, great rooms, outstanding staff, terrible covid."
2,"Room fees are DOUBLE the room cost. Marijuana permeates the entire floor, outside, strip and surrounding area. Skunk weed. It&apos;s gone totally ghetto. Additionally, Las Vegas Nevada is dead.

At less than 10% capacity.
No buffets open.
No shows.
No conventions.
No coins in slot machines ( all paper tickets ).
Jacuzzi&apos;s are outlawed.
Homeless littering the streets.
Crime through the roof.
It&apos;s filthy like San Francisco.
It&apos;s ghetto with swarms of loitering listless drug addicts.
The smell of marijuana permeates not only only the streets but the hotel rooms all smell like skunk weed.
The smell of sewage often overpowers the smell of skunk weed.
Remember free drinks at a slot machine? No longer. Now it&apos;s $11 beers and you go get it yourself.
The Mob has become weak.
The police can&apos;t keep up.
MGM, which controls most of the hotels and casinos seems to have given up.
The city of 644,000 people is bankrupt.

Las Vegas Nevada is dead.

Next year it will be a ghost town.

First hand report. I thought you might like to know. I will not go back until they clean it up.

4,"I was skeptical going here based on the reviews but i had a comped stay from MGM for park MGM but bc of covid protocols and them not being opened during the week we got moved here and honestly.....

IT WAS A GOOD STAY!!!! NOT GREAT BC I LOST MONEY GAMBLING IN THIS CITY! LOL but overall this was a nice stay. The rooms were clean and had everything you need and we opted not to get housekeeping while we were there but we did ask the housekeepers for towels and other things and they complied always. 

OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU GO TO VEGAS ANY HOTEL WILL HAVE RESORT FEES AND OBVIOUSLY YOUR CREDIT CARD WILL HAVE A HOLD ON IT FOR A COUPLE DAYS!!, i hate cheap people crying about that like what were you expecting going to the strip? Go to your local casino if you are going to cry some more about it.

I would definitely stay here again, noise was not an issue, obviously also all strip hotels don&apos;t give you a fridge but hey that&apos;s why you get your supplies at Walgreen&apos;s beforehand and get ice from the hotel hallway and you can have a good time!"
1,"I am so disappointed from start it was just a disaster when we ran over a glass jar in the parking lot... Then when we get to our suite it&apos;s filthy you have stains on the toilet inside the toilet and also nothings been clean in the room as far as the tables and the countertop in the surfaces are concerned... It&apos;s ridiculous and it&apos;s stench in here also they say on the website that this room comes with a refrigerator so I have a child that has a special diet so that&apos;s why I got the room and the refrigerator is full of soda and hotel snacks ..... 

Disappointed .... not to mention the customer service the female who was checking me in was so rude and so short patient I am so done with it mannered customer service. However the bell man who took our logic luggage upstairs he was very nice so he deserved a really nice tip and that I&apos;m happy for."
1,"This once Grand hotel is now the Grand Ghetto of the Strip. Good...fucking...grief. I dont think I walked 5 paces without the stench of weed. Our entire floor was smothered in that stench. The toilet was broken. All sinks semi-clogged. Parents room TV did not work. Several stary hairs in the awful center sinking beds. Its an absolute shitfest pig-sty, to be kind.
Imagine a walmart hotel, ok there you go. Now have fun booking.
No fridge, all minibar shit packed in there. Oh also safe wasnt closing had to call someone.
Ive never seen a lower quality of people in my life (not wealth wise class and dignity/appearance wise) anywhere in the world than this hotel. Feel sorry for employees here. Never again.
Best part? Leaving to cross the bridge to NYNY, shit ANYWHERE ELSE."
5,"We booked this hotel off of orbitz and had a wonderful experience. We stayed in a wellness suite which included a sunrise alarm clock, Vitamin C infused shower, a air purifier, And aromatherapy. Upon arrival we broke the seal on our door showing the room have been sanitized. Many of the restaurants within the casino or not currently open however there is a large selection. You do need to make reservations regardless of if you were going to a bar or a restaurant most often you can make them right there at the hostess stand. The beds are super comfortable and suite with super spacious. The staff was friendly and super helpful. We would return in the future."
1,"Unfortunately my stay was less than pleasant. We upgraded to accommodate our child and the upgrade was subpar at best abs definitely not worth the additional $180 for two nights. There are very minimal accommodations in the room (no microwave, no coffee pot, low thread count sheet like linens, and over priced bar that charges you to look at the drinks). The guest service clerk was moody which ensured that I will never book here again. The mattress on both the bed and the pull out couch are very hard and my husband and I were unable to sleep comfortably. The signature mgm has much better accommodations, do yourself a favor and stay there instead."
1,"1 stars... cause the room... but really 0stars... So we&apos;re here in the MGM Casino playing the Price is Right.... right next to the lobby... and one of these Top Flight Paul Blart yellow shirt Security walked by us... cause theses drama people and we were looked... passed by us sayin... are u playing or being Nosy.... &quot;BEING NOSY BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Wtf was it to u... mind your own fukn business!!!!
