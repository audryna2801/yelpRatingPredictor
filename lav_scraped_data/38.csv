5,"I really enjoyed my time at the Plaza, when we entered we were greated by security at the podium and they were always kind and welcoming. Also there were two gentlemen on the casino floor who walked around and cheered on the slot players who were wining. They set a great vibe for the casino floor that was desperately needed during these strange covid times."
5,"I&apos;m always attracted to older, lower end hotels that have an opportunity to shine even though they me from a by gone era.  The Plaza fits that bill.  I was on a work-from-home-but-work-from-somewhere-else-instead mood and I decided to give Las Vegas a try.  I wanted a cheaper hotel but it had to be clean and older.  I immediately remembered The Plaza and made a reservation.  I was put on the 19th floor (out of 21) and my room was very nice.  You can tell the room has been renovated in the recent years to have a modern yet retro look.  The AC (it was 106 during the day) worked great, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was very clean (in a COVID-19 world), view was nice, and most importantly, the internet was quick and worked with all my work related programs, firewalls, and VPN.  I was completely satisfied with my stay at The Plaza and will call again!"
5,"Kendra the security guard is wonderful! She has a tough job keeping everyone with their masks on, but while she talks to you she asks about your story and tells her own. She makes me want to come back to the plaza for the wonderful staff!"
3,"We travelled to Las Vegas for my kids 21st birthday. Stayed at the Plaza as we have many times. 
This time was different one of our rooms smelled so bad! I was patient and went with it. Early the first morning our smoke detector started chirping. We thought it was the battery but after we finally got maintenance there it was chirping because of the smoke coming in from the other room. The folks must&apos;ve been smoking in the bathroom because it was coming through our vent. 
Around 9am I went down to the front desk and talked with Andrèa, she was very annoyed that I was there. In my frustration I used a curse work, not towards her but explaining my morning after listening to the smoke detector chirp for 6 hours. 
She told me that she could change me rooms, I said- shouldn&apos;t you just be kicking out the folks smoking? 
She told me that she&apos;d have security and maintenance stop by. With her attitude I asked that her manager call me, she confirmed the number. 
At 4:30 we got back to our room to chirping and a stinky floor and room. 
I had still received no phone call. I went down and talked with Jennifer. She said the director was in meetings but that she was Andrèa equal and would help take care of my issues. 
She offered a $20 refund on my room and $10 on the other room. No apology just a refund when I pushed for what they would do for me. 
We love staying at the Plaza however, for future visits we will consider staying somewhere else because of the way we were treated."
3,"I stay at this hotel often.  Good prices and it was re-done a few years ago, so it is relatively nice.  The guy at the front desk reception was rude though and didn&apos;t give a damn.  He didn&apos;t remind us to stamp our parking and made us wait to be helped although there was no one in line and he wasn&apos;t helping anyone.

Stay here to save a little $$$, not for good service or luxury!"
4,"My favorite part of the plaza hotel:
Silver Strike Coins!

I found 2x silver strike machines and if you get the &quot;Silver Strike&quot; on the Third wheel, you win a random token that are worth $10.00 if you exchange them at the cashiers cage. I won 6 of those after spending about $50.00 at $0.75 per spin of the machine. Honestly, don&apos;t play it unless you really want a nice souvenir. 

The picture attached are 4 of 6 different versions they currently have. 

Big minus is they charge for parking."
5,"The service here was great from the getgo. I requested a room near the elevator and that&apos;s exactly what I got.  The pool is pretty small and way too crowded. The room itself was nice but doesn&apos;t have a full length mirror, just the small mirror in the bathroom area. 

Fun fact: if you get a king size bed, there&apos;s a good chance your room will come with a little table and couch off to the side. My friend had a room with 2 queens and they didn&apos;t have the little table and couch in their room.

Overall, I give it 5 stars due to the fact that good and friendly service matters a lot. I get sick of rude and bitchy staff on power trips at other establishments."
2,Beds and pillows suck! Pool is not heated year round. Some elevators are sketchy. Staff is rude.
5,"I&apos;m really not sure why they have bad reviews. I decided to take a chance and you should too. Ok it&apos;s the simplest room I&apos;ve ever stayed in but it was clean and decent for my family. I had a nice view. The lights are dim and the bathroom is really small and tight in space.  I&apos;m not sure why they have bad reviews bc at the end of the day you pay for what you get.. if you want strip prices or more luxury go to the strip and stay. I think this hotel was ok for what I paid.. My room were cleaned every day and staff was helpful.  I&apos;m not going to lie if I come back by myself or possibly family lol I would probably stay in the more luxury hotels along the strip.. but if you want cheap and decent this is your cup of tea bottom line! At the end of the day your not going be in the room anyways

Also the casino area isn&apos;t bad .. not too smoky and busy just the average casino without the packed crowds."
1,"Disappointment is an understatement!  I booked this room for my bachelorette party that was canceled last year due to Covid. 
They were unable to accommodate the requests that I asked for, which was a view of Freemont St and two queen size beds. 
My party felt pressured to upgrade our room by Randall, even though it should have been done initially. All while he made a joke that he gets more commission if we did. We paid extra to upgrade to a room that has a crappy view of Freemont st, the WiFi doesn&apos;t work or connect to anything! We were told that if our room was higher up there was no one booked up there or around so we could celebrate. We have had security call about a noise complaint twice and all we had was our music on. The hardwood floors make everything echo. You can hear peoples conversations in the hallway from their rooms. We have asked for toiletries which were never received and no effort was made to bring them to our room. The shower is small, no room to put any shampoo/conditioner/soap...etc.  
The casino is tight- no pay out. There is NO parking- it&apos;s confusing figuring out where it&apos;s located. The parking garage is completely on the other side of the casino, so be prepared to make a long trip with all your belongings whenever you want to leave/come back.
Do yourself a favor and book at a nicer casino/hotel with better accommodations and customer service! With all the fees that they tack on, you can get a nicer experience somewhere else for the same cost!!"
3,"Casino Review Only:

I can still smell the stale smoke and the musty carpet of the dimly lit casino floor. The shadows host a few shady characters and I see a number of Wiccans dressed in black pulling the slots hoping their magick spells draws the rewards from behind the spinning wheels. As I feed the Willie Nelson bandit before me my dollars it plays short clips of his greatest hits as the credits gradually disappear, it doesn&apos;t seem like an even trade off or even slightly entertaining.

The table games were sparsely staffed, a few players sip their watered down bourbon as they wait on the elusive twenty-one and pray for a Five-Card-Charlie as the single digits pile-up. I hear the rally cries as the roulette wheel ball bounces from odd to even some play their birth dates others betting scared money either way the Croupier is stacking dollars.

There are hints of nostalgia here but most have been hidden behind flashy digital hardware, but ultimately the casino is selling excitement and entertainment, which is comprised of hope and variance. If you come to Vegas for anything other than to be entertained you&apos;ll probably be disappointed these casinos are not here to finance your life, all you need to do is look around at your surrounding they aren&apos;t building or renovations these majestic structures on the winning of their clientele. If you hit the big one always &quot;cash out&quot; there&apos;s plenty of time to reinvest and the slots don&apos;t reprogram when the ticket is removed or reinserted that mindset is the human factor that the casinos depend on to keep you pulling that handle or pushing those buttons.

Since I&apos;ve never stayed here I can&apos;t speak of the amenities or customer service here so much - my only interaction was with the lady at the cage window as she peeled off a few hundred dollar bills after I presented her with my digital winning ticket of course she wished me good luck which was more scripted than genuine and taught during her employment orientation - hopefully your common sense overrules your dependence on luck and you walk away after you win like I did..."
1,"We arrived at The Plaza on Fremont Street on February 28th, on the 29th in the morning got up to get ready for the day.....the sink was totally clogged. Had maintenance come up to unplug. That evening came back to the room and tried to take a shower....NO HOT WATER!  Could not tell us when they could get it fixed so we had to pack up and move to another room.  The new Room was soooo hot ..tried to cool down with air conditioner.....was not working, maintenance came up and after about an hour finally got it to work! The day we were checking out, check out time was 11:00 a.m., our flight wasn&apos;t until 6:00 that evening...tried to check our luggage with the bellman and were told they were not providing that service at this time! Also said NO ONE WAS PROVIDING THIS SERVICE AT THIS TIME WHICH WE FOUND OUT WAS A LIE!!! We had to drag our luggage around to lunch and all afternoon until we left to the airport!"
1,"This was my experience at the Plaza.....and their response. Way to solve a problem by screwing over the customer!

Hello, 

I am writing to you today because I need to share my experience at the Plaza on 9/5/2020.

I arrived, checked into my hotel room, and left to meet friends. 

When I returned to the Plaza, I drove through the parking garage 4 times...one of  those times I asked the parking attendant if there was any parking. He directed me to the overflow lot.

After driving through the overflow lot, I realized there were NO parking spots anywhere! As I looked around, I saw a lot of people parked and tailgating in the parking lot. There were parties and BLM protests. Overall, it seemed to be chaotic and crowded.

At this point, it seems my options are limited and I did not feel comfortable parking my car on the street and walking to the hotel, as I was alone. Honestly, I have been to Las Vegas and stayed at your hotel many times. This time however, I did not feel safe.

The only available parking somewhat close to the hotel, in your overflow lot, was handicap parking. (Many empty spots) Although, in normal circumstances I would never consider parking in a handicap spot, however, in this instance I did.

I went and talked to the parking lot attendant after I parked my car. I told him I did not feel safe walking city blocks to the hotel. I am a registered guest and shouldn&apos;t I be guaranteed a parking spot? He replied, I should be okay as this is a private lot.

Of course, I ended up with a $250.00 ticket and I think the Plaza should absorb this cost. Had there been any other parking spaces available I would have parked there. 

I am really disappointed as I have stayed at the Plaza many times when I travel to Las Vegas. Up until this experience, the Plaza has been my favorite place to stay in downtown.

The next night I stayed on the strip at the Bellagio. While they were offering free parking to anyone, they checked to ensure I was a registered guest at the hotel before they let me into the parking garage.

I fail to understand why the Plaza did not do the same. Instead, you offered free parking to everyone regardless of whether or not they were staying at the hotel. Only to put me and I am sure other guests, at a disadvantage. 

Things are bad enough with Covid and then to read about the violence in Las Vegas that very Friday night. I was left with very few choices.

I would appreciate a response, and perhaps some way we can come to understanding. I do not think it is fair for me to pay a $250.00 parking ticket that could have been avoided, had the Plaza put their guest safety and priorities first.

Please see attached photo of ticket.

I look forward to your response,
Wendie 



BEGINNIN&apos; O&apos; TH&apos; WEEKEND 4:02 AS THE SUN BE SETTIN&apos;

Hello Wendie, thank you for your message and for sharing your experience. We have since started charging for parking to help for this reason. We apologize for the inconvenience."
5,"I want praise the Plaza Hotel Casino in Las Vegas due to the Corona virus. I was supposed to go to Vegas on Sunday 3/15 - 3/19 but due to the Hype in the Media and my friends being scared we all decided to cancel our trip . I was looking forward to stay there since I haven&apos;t been before . 
     Since I cancelled only 2 days prior the reservation agent transferred me to  Guest Relation services. Normally you due need to give hotel at least 72hrs prior notice for no penalty, although due to this Corona Virus they waive my 1 night deposit . This hotel handle my situation 5 star customer service and I will be calling them in the near future"
5,"Excellent &amp; will stay again. We stayed one night for our Elvis Vegas wedding, and the room was perfect! Service was amazing."
1,"I stayed here with a colleague on January 17, 2020. I have first hand dealt with your staff and &quot;security&quot;. Ridiculous.  

The day in question I was with a colleague in our room. My lower back was REALLY sore and it was actually hard to walk or sit. 
It was time for me to head out and I made it outside to order a Lyft and just get home as quickly as possible. As I walked out of the Plaza Casino valet I Asked a guard where the pickup location for Lyft was and that I was having back issues and was scared it was going to seize. He was rude and didn&apos;t help, he just pointed at the street and said &quot;there&quot;. He wasn&apos;t doing ANYTHING at all. I then stated &quot;can you please just help me because I don&apos;t think I can walk far. I&apos;ll have the car come pick me up here because I&apos;m in a lot of pain&quot;. He dismissed me rudely again and said &quot;it&apos;s around the corner&quot; and walked away. So I walked from pillar to pillar, 2-3 of them, holding on to each one and taking a break to let the pain subside. Then it happened, my lower back seized and I fell to the ground in immense pain. It was probably the worst pain I&apos;ve ever felt and it was as if someone was ripping my spine out of my body. I writhed on the ground in agony, on their property, in their site, on their walkway. The pain was so excruciating I couldn&apos;t see or focus. It was hard to speak and breath. The guard came up and looked at me standing over me and looking down. I told him I needed a medic. I was so embarrassed and just wanted to get off the dirty gross as ground but any time I moved the pain intensified. Another guard shows up and they&apos;re chatting and looking at me and laughing. They believed I was faking it. Probably some scam artist trying to sue the casino.
Well, that was really unprofessional and I was so mad and couldn&apos;t do a damn thing.
This went on for 30 min maybe even 40 min total. I asked him where the medic was and he said &quot;I thought you called them?&quot; What?!? I&apos;m on your property, I asked you to call. I can barely do anything. He asked for my phone and then called. What a F**King joke this place is. But Of course it is, it&apos;s downtown Las Vegas.
Not one bit of help from the staff there. Horrendous!!! I even emailed them directly and got no response. I&apos;m not asking for anyone to be liable for me, but assist someone who obviously needs it.
I will never set foot in this place again. I should have sued!! LOL. For what? Horrible customer service and staff? It&apos;s all so ridiculous.
The best part, when a group of drunk a**holes walked by telling me &quot;get up you pu**y&quot; and the guards laughing along with them.

NOT AT ALL professional. 

UPDATE:. Yelp keeps taking my review down from this hotel. This will be my 3rd post, because for some reason the hotel keeps flagging it and Yelp takes it down no questions.  This is a review about their customer service and their casino/hotel and it&apos;s staff.  That goes to show you how they don&apos;t care about people/clientele and only care about  coming off as a great place to stay rather than doing the work to make it a great place.  They&apos;re losing money obviously and don&apos;t want anymore bad word of mouth."
3,"Located past the main stage on Fremont is this old hotel and casino. Plaza has been around almost forever. It&apos;s one of the oldest hotels in the city. This certainly looks like it. You can find cheap rooms. 

It was opened years ago. It has been renovated a few times but you wouldn&apos;t know it. The casino smells like ass, and most food in the dining areas smells even worse. Not everywhere is the food bad. One good place is Pop Up Pizza. Except for the price, it&apos;s Vegas&apos;s best. They sell it by the slice so it softens the blow. You can find it in the food court on the southern end of the casino along with a few other corporate places. At the northern end of the casino are a few more places to eat. The best known is Hash House. It serves greasy shit for breakfast. This is an apparently popular place even though it smells like cigarettes and grease. 

Though I&apos;ve never stayed here I have seen a room before. It looked old but it was suitable for a night. The place is much cheaper for a reason."
2,"We came here to eat at Oscar&apos;s Steakhouse.  On your way to the steakhouse you have to go through the casino first.  The decor is old and worn out.  The demo for this casino seems to be 21-25 years old.  It looked like a frat house with the run down decor and everyone running around with a beer in their hand wearing ball caps and tshirts.  I wasn&apos;t expecting the Bellagio but as nice as the steakhouse was, the casino was bad.  I know room rates are cheap here so maybe that&apos;s why all the kids stay here."
4,"The Plaza has been stepping up it&apos;s game and the changes are noticeable. I can&apos;t say what the hotel rooms are like since my last stay over a year ago but the casino floor has been revamped and new machines added. It still has that old-school Vegas feeling inside as well as that old-school Vegas smell. I&apos;m nostalgic like that. They do a decent job of pumping out the smoke but there&apos;s enough lingering around if you sniff hard enough lol. 

The dealers and the pit bosses are friendly and cocktail servers quick to bring you drinks. If you ask nicely the pit boss, Oscar, will validate your parking. My favorite thing at the Plaza is the nightly funk band. They start around 8PM and play until 2AM. You&apos;ll instantly be put in a better mood by listening and dancing to them. The vibe here is upbeat with people stopping to dance along their walk through the casino. 

On this last visit my husband and I tried bingo and won twice! They have bingo every two hours on the odd hour. 11AM, 1PM, 3PM etc. Only disappointment was the Bitcoin machine that is normally by Pop Up Pizza was gone this trip. My husband was more sad than I was. He likes to take a picture next to it each trip (no joke lol). 

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite casinos downtown and hopefully the positive changes continue!"
1,"So, &quot;The Plaza&quot; has a deal that educators can have the $26.50/day resort fee waived. However, if you book through Hotels.com, they will not honor that commitment to educators. Gary, at the front desk, was UNbelievably UNhelpful to help resolve this issue. Thanks, Gary! Gary, thank you for ruining what had been a great staycation for us. We tried to support local Vegas.  Won&apos;t go back to The Plaza.  Nice job, Gary."
