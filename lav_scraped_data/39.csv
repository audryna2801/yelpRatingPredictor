4,"Planet Hollywood has always been an enjoyable place to gamble and eat... but I&apos;m concerned about Covid while playing at their table games.  On the plus side, the staff pays attention to those who crowd too closely or wear masks wrong.  They&apos;re not afraid to tell the clueless.  And there are plenty of sanitizing dispensers around.  

But did they get around the rule of &apos;three to a table&apos; by putting in plexiglass barriers, so that five can play at the same time?  I&apos;ve never been a fan of the barriers because it stifles talk and deadens the table, without making things any safer.  It kind of defeats the purpose when people are talking louder and spraying into the air more just to be heard because of the plastic dividers. Those barriers at PH are thin compared to other places I&apos;ve seen, and they don&apos;t go up very high.  Plus the same amount of people as BEFORE the pandemic are seated within the same area, about 8 foot by 6 foot.  So at PH, there are six people bunched together, when you include dealer....that seems like a lot of potential coughers and sneezers in a space not much larger than an elevator.  I get that these tables with barriers seat more people, hence more revenue, but for the time being I think it&apos;s safer to play somewhere that spreads out just three players per table, with the added elbow room.  

Otherwise, thumbs up for the $10 blackjack table in the afternoon at PH with their friendly dealers, the upbeat music, free parking, interesting stores, good restaurants, and all those cleaners who were working hard and doing their best to make surfaces safer."
4,"Will stay here again. We had a football tournament in Bullhead City AZ and stayed in Laughlin at the Tropicana then checked out Sunday and drove to Vegas to stay here. Can I say it was a much needed upgrade. Our room was clean and comfy. Our view wasn&apos;t much but we didn&apos;t stay in the room for that. We were able to gamble a little as well. Everyone was nice that we encountered. I enjoyed the hand sanitizer stations everywhere. My only negative feedback is the overly abundant smell of weed outside, inside and other places."
4,Came here on a Sunday evening and was pleasantly surprised that they had a DJ. All Covid regulations were heavily enforced. The music was good and the skinny margarita was even better. The bar tender was super friendly and gave us tips on where to go.
4,"Nothing better than a little reset getaway!! 
Finally got the chance to stay at Planet Hollywood a few days ago and it was definitely better than expected. We stayed in the Ultra resort room, and it was very spacious, although there wasn&apos;t much of a view, it was a nice room for 4 people. 

One downside of this hotel is the check-in/check-out process. They send you emails about skipping the lines and using express check in/out. I thought this was a great idea because usually this takes long, but once we arrived the express kiosk wasn&apos;t working and would freeze, this seemed to happen to a few other people next to us. We had to eventually wait in line for an employee to help with the process. Another thing to BEWARE of, is how COLD the adult pool is lol we were expecting a nice pool day while sipping on some $20 pina coladas but wow did that change quick, I&apos;m sure this would be fine during the summer when its over 100 degrees but any other time, it&apos;s a no for me. 

We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend to try Yolo&apos;s Mexican restaurant inside the casino!!"
2,"My girlfriend and I were having a great birthday weekend until we received a complimentary night from a text message from Caesar&apos;s entertainment &quot;Ivy&quot; promotions. 
The offer was a complimentary night, just pay taxes and resort fee. So what the hell. 
Our stay was Thursday and check out Sunday but the promotion allowed us to check out Monday morning. 

The cleaning lady on Sunday.. while we were at brunch completely removed all our belongings. We had my girlfriends insulin, (type 1 diabetic) worth 250$.. our bottles and left over food for my family back in CA around 100$ and souvenirs left in the room  equaling more than 400$ worth of products taken from us and management made me write a statement/report about the incident with security and that ended up going cold. 

Long story short.. our items were considered perishable and because of Covid.. The items had been recycled.
Terrible.. terrible service"
4,Can&apos;t beat their Vegas strip location. East access to other casinos and shops. I really do love their miracle mile with plenty of shops to choose from. Good place to gamble and unwind. Clean up to date casino. I felt safe while I was gambling. Our room was clean but it did smell like cigarettes considering it was a non smoking room. They don&apos;t offer handicapped automatic doors. The valet can be pricey at $32 per day. Bought 5 water bottles at their convenience store and it came out to a shocking $32 dollars. A bit steep for water. The good out weigh the bad and I&apos;ll stay here in the future.
3,"So we picked this place because we have stayed here in the past. The rooms are different. No memorabilia like before. 

Check in was somewhat easy. When I went to check in, the kiosk just froze and kept
Spinning stuck. Luckily for me a live person was able to help me. Yes a live person can never be replaced by a machine. 

The room was nice. The bed was comfortable. Ran into some small snags. Like a flashing light on the wall. Nail polish on the nightstand and holes in the linen. Oh the walls are not soundproof. My kids had to hear the neighbor playing her rap music (A lot of cursing in the rap) and her cursing like a sailor. Thank god she finally left to gamble. 

Other than that, it was a decent stay for the price."
5,"Spent 4 nights ,Thursday thru Monday in early February. Room was fine, didn&apos;t gamble much or eat at the hotel. Two things stand out.  The digital concierge via text was great , very useful and helpful. Part is robotic, part is human.(my guess)  This is all Caesars properties I believe. Second, my daughter left an electronic item in the room and didn&apos;t say anything for 2 weeks. Contacted the hotel, they responded by email requesting contact by phone to confirm the item, the packed it properly to ship it back."
2,"Lately the hotel has been so dead.  I understand they are just staring to pick up since Covid but one thing that I cannot wrap my head around is the fact that the staff her either don&apos;t know where the restrooms are or they do not know that they close certain ones at certain times. I was walking around trying to find a restroom and I felt like I ended up walking the entire property, the mall area included. Once I found a restroom it was a mess and hadn&apos;t been well maintained at all.  It was pretty bad.  I went and hit a few tables and the workers weren&apos;t the friendliest. I wasn&apos;t feeling the vibe at all in here and there was no energy like there had been before.  I was pleased at least with the fact that the staff were very careful about how many people were at the table and how crowded it was, etc.  I had hoped that there would be some sort of music playing or at least nearby but nope, nothing. The location of the hotel and casino are great but there wasn&apos;t much to look forward to here. I miss the old energetic vibe of this place. I hope it comes back soon. And I hope the staff get their stuff together too."
5,We&apos;ve stayed in this hotel a few times now and we haven&apos;t had a bad experience. It&apos;s right in the middle of the strip and has a Fat Tuesday inside. The people who work at the stores are very friendly and helpful. It&apos;s easy to get in and out of the parking lot. It&apos;s a reasonably priced. Clean rooms.
3,"Stayed here during my elopement over NYE weekend a few weeks ago. This place certainly looks and feels MUCH different now in my 30s than it did during all my Vegas trips in my young 20s lol. Overall, we wouldn&apos;t stay here again because it was just too meh. 

We chose this spot because I&apos;d always wanted to try it out when I was much younger, but had opted for cheaper strip-based hotels in the past. We also liked that it&apos;s truly about as mid-strip as one can be - it&apos;s right in the middle of the action! The attached Miracle Mile mall is a huge plus because you really don&apos;t have to leave the property to eat, drink, or buy stuff if you don&apos;t want to. 

ROOMS: on the larger side for Vegas. Theme is old and new Hollywood. Some of the wall art was cool. The bathroom had one of those lighted mirrors that makes everyone look beautiful no matter what haha. Tub was small, but there was one separate of the stand up shower. Toilet was behind its own door within the bathroom. No bathroom or toilet fan, so minus some points there. The best part was the beds - seriously, one of the most comfortable hotel beds we&apos;ve ever slept on! We slept so hard because the beds were THAT comfy! 

The walls are paper thin. I know it was NYE weekend, so rowdiness was to be expected, but we could legit hear every single word of the conversations happening in the next room. Our friends had to move rooms because they were too close to the elevator shaft and could hear every movement of the elevator super loudly. We had 3 rooms in our party for the weekend spread out on 3 different floors and everyone&apos;s view sucked - they all overlooked the lower floors&apos; roof. I&apos;m guessing there are very few rooms that are strip or backside-facing. 

PARKING: free for hotel guests, BUT if you can be dropped off at the front, do that instead. The only property entrance from the garage drops you right in the middle of the mall. You then have to walk an equidistant amount going either way (the mall is a big circle) to the hotel lobby. It&apos;s a long way and was treacherous with each of us carrying a bag, rolling bag, and my wedding dress and his wedding tux. It seriously took like 20 min. to drag all our stuff through the mall and we&apos;re both in great shape lol. NOT fun and NOT a good way to start out the trip! 

CHECK-IN: this is one of the major reasons for 3 instead of 4 stars. It was absolutely horrible. Due to COVID, no one is working the actual check-in desk. You have to rely on kiosks that don&apos;t do what they&apos;re supposed to. They had one employee floating the floor that wouldn&apos;t even stop when we begged for assistance. It took 30 min. to check in even though there was no line - that&apos;s just how long it took the kiosks to work properly and to track down someone to help. This was with a pre-booking paid for online that we needed to add a name to for check-in. Nothing complicated at all. 

This place would have received a solid 3 from us, mostly due to its overall lack of niceness, but is getting a 4 for the following - location on the strip, Pinup Pizza, Flights, and the Mardi Gras drink place are all located here, free parking, decent price, and insanely comfy beds."
1,"Avoid the PLANET HOLLYWOOD VEGAS hotel! Unless you want to stay in a dirty room w/broken shower, toilet that won&apos;t flush, no maid service for fresh towels and rude customer service. Still waiting for my refund through Alaska Airlines. #planethollywoodhotel #vegas #PH

Will gladly delete my review once you refund my money!"
5,"this is the best place we went for @DEFCON
#DEFCON meetings it was real busy you have to pay 300- Three hundred dollars cash since this is DEFCON any one can come there
to be safe than using credit card in that place there are likely to have an Hackers they are suspecting
Anyhow, lovely place the people who work their and people who live in @Las Vegas Elite like Ms. Susan all make a true difference
i would like to always go there - it is like a dream place come true
amazing good place, scenic and time goes so fast
Really  Grateful Gravyboat to them.
With the holidays coming up . In a time when the news hits hard, .wanted to thank them on this #ThankYouThursday to give gratitude to the that have been there for methrough the sourdough craze and virtual madness that is 2020.

They are  incredible how many people - just wanted to let them  know that it doesn&apos;t go unnoticed. November 19th 2020 Thursday tooday for #ThankYouThursday and give some love to  them."
1,Pretty awful service given the popularity of this hotel. Bathroom toilet did not work and there was old gum left on the floor from prior visitors. Expected more from a 4 star hotel.
2,Worse experience ever playing on table 111 with the dealer Danka she is very rude and has no customer service skills. I felt super uncomfortable playing on her table. I would never again play on her table to say it in a nice way.
4,"Stayed here over this past weekend. Room was clean and very nice. The beds are SUPER comfy. The bathroom was nice-it had a shower, tub, and toilet separately. 

Overall enjoyed my stay here. The only thing I didn&apos;t like was the fact that the parking structure was so far away from the hotel. During my yearly trips to Vegas my family and I always venture out of the strip to shop, eat, etc. You have to walk all the way through the mall attached to the hotel to get to the actual hotel. I think that alone is the only reason I&apos;m not staying here next time I come to Vegas."
3,"This review is just of the casino area of the hotel.  I stayed at the adjacent Elara over New Year&apos;s weekend.  It&apos;s connected to Planet Hollywood by the Miracle Miles Shoppes.  So, I spent a fair amount of time in this casino and in the Miracle Mile.

The place was clean and lively for NYE.  You almost wouldn&apos;t have known we were in the middle of a pandemic.  The dealers were nice, and the helpful on all the games you didn&apos;t know.  However, they had people (let&apos;s call them the Gestapo) walking around ensuring everyone was toeing the proverbial line when it came to their self-imposed Covid restrictions.  If you stopped to watch a craps table, in short order a member of the Gestapo would come up to you and say &quot;I can&apos;t have you standing around here.&quot;  There were most often, if not always, plenty of separation from others.  Masks were being worn, and you could fairly surmise that for a public place, the risk was as low as it could be.  I went to a couple other casinos over the weekend, and NONE of them had this absurd restriction in place.

Some of the Gestapo are rude and abrupt.  Some were polite.  Even if you have a drink NEAR YOUR LIPS, some of them had the audacity to tell you to pull your mask up, only to pretend they didn&apos;t see the drink.  That part was awful. Not a chill time at all.

All the restaurants in the casino area would tell you that you needed reservations to get in, and the reservations were often over 90 minutes away, and on New Year&apos;s Day, not until the next day.  However, you could see in the restaurants and see that there were abundant tables empty with nobody sitting within 6 feet.  So I call BS on that.

I&apos;m giving it three stars because it is a nice property and they did their best to keep things going during trying times.  Otherwise, it would have been zero stars."
1,"I stayed here with my family on vacation a week ago and was appalled by the condition of the room. When first walking in, everything seemed clean but once we started to get ready to sleep, my younger child found a bottle of listerine and a used hair clip on the floor. We were going to shrug it off until we found a pair of tweezers in the bed that was supposed to be clean and made. The sheets had stains and hair on them as well. When telling the staff, they said that they had only been re-opened for a week and gave us a new room.

The second room wasn&apos;t much better as we had a leaking toilet that made a loud noise about every 10 minutes throughout the night. The sink faucet handles were almost broken as well and we had to put pressure on them in order to even turn the sink on. I have video of both but am unable to post them., We will not be staying here again."
4,"Stayed one night in one of the ultra hip suites. &quot;Low&quot; floor had a view of the pool area, which thankfully was closed. I imagine that it would&apos;ve been very loud with music and we wouldn&apos;t have gotten much sleep if it was open. PH guests could use the pool at Paris at this time, but we opted not to and just enjoyed a soak in the suite&apos;s tub. The room was spacious, with two TVs, comfortable king bed, a sitting area as well as a small space with a table &amp; chairs for dining. There was a small closet but plenty of drawers and space to store our things."
2,"One of my worst hotels, my bathroom floor was dirty , the express check in was a joke took forever and the view was the top of the roof . Also I was charged these extra fees . I booked with a third party , I wasn&apos;t happy with this place ."
