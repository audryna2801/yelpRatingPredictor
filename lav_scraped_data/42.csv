5,"The tower suites has become one of my fave rooms! After a long day of drinking and walking the strip there&apos;s no better way to end the night with a nice soak in the tub. Be sure to grab some CBD bath bombs to really make this enjoyable. 

The walk from parking to room wasn&apos;t bad like at other hotels on the strip. Drinks are pricy and I didn&apos;t win in the casino but I&apos;ll surely be back just based on the room alone!"
4,"This is my 2nd time staying at the Aria. The first time was pre covid for a work conference and the 2nd time was recently during covid for leisure. My experience now was great. The rooms were spotless. The resort had disposable masks everywhere and in the room they  left us two cloth masks and a hand sanitizer. 

I absolutely love this resort as there is so many restaurants, the casino is great and the rooms are always clean. I would have given this resort a 5 star if the waiters around the Casinos were more attentive. I was playing for about an hour in the casinos and not one person came around asking if i wanted a drink and once i found a person she told me she was going on her break and someone else was coming around but no one came around. While playing in the casinos for 4 days that i stayed at The Aria i had to get my own drinks cause no one was around. 

Other than that, if you are looking for a luxurious hotel i recommend this one. It is connected to The crystals (mall) and you can cut through there to go to the strip. The beauty of this resort is that it is super close and walking distance from many things."
4,"First time staying at the Aria and it just happened to be during a pandemic and my first time traveling since February 2020. I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect in regards to covid protocol but I was surprisingly impressed with the protocol and felt more safe in Vegas then I do in CA!

As of Feb 2021:
Covid protocol 
Hand washing sinks built out in the casino.
Masks required to be worn at all times. They really do enforce this and employees have masks on hand to provide to those who aren&apos;t wearing one.
The room provides a &quot;safety kit&quot; two aria masks, hand sanitizer and a mask holder case--greatly appreciated!

Hotel Room:
We stayed in the king room strip view and it was so dreamy. Bed soft, clean and plush pillows. My favorite part of the room was the bath tub/shower. The bathtub was so dreamy (big and luxurious) and loved how the shower was conjoined. The room also had a fully stocked fridge, safe and robes. Along with a comfortable room it was technology advanced. The iPad on the dresser controlled lights, thermostat and curtains. It was nice to have the blackout curtains which made a peaceful sleep and hangover less painful lol. I just tend to be old school at times so sometimes had issues with controlling lights and thermostat so this was the only ding. 

Overall, location of Aria is prime and has some of my favorite restaurants onsite from Javiers to Catch. It&apos;s convenient Aria is located next door to the cosmo and is conjoined to the canal shops which is a big plus. Staff and cleaning staff was very pleasant and welcoming. Our room was always spotless when requesting a clean. 

Tip: $150 incidentals per night
Uber/lyft pickup and drop off is on the north lower level by club light

Clubs still currently closed due to covid but they have an awesome lounge Alibi that has some solid drinks and great music!"
1,"I&apos;ve been to Vegas countless times and always try and prepare myself for the gouging the resorts etc give you.  However, it doesn&apos;t ever seem to get better.  NEVER do you pay the advertised prices online.  There are always countless taxes and fees tacked on top of the base cost which add 50% more to the grand total.  I was there with a group of veterans I served with in the Gulf War 30 years ago for our reunion and was told we&apos;d receive a discount. 
 That was never applied and when we asked upon checkout, they said those are automatically applied during booking.

We tried to order room service and the phone in the room wasn&apos;t working so my fiance&apos; tried calling my cell phone 5 times as I was down getting a $12 cup of coffee.  Each time the phone rang, there was nothing but silence.  Turns out there was a problem with the phone so we placed a trouble ticket for it to be repaired.  Upon checkout we get the final bill.  Each of those calls cost $24.40.  Of course they were removed because the calls weren&apos;t successful, but it made me realize once again, how badly these places gouge you.  I think you should be ashamed to charge what you do.  Yes its a nice place and one should expect to pay more, but you&apos;re literally raping people.  Just for kicks, I looked at the mini bar prices.  12oz can of soda - $12.95.  Small can of Pringles - $22.00.  I&apos;ll absolutely never stay again.  I&apos;ve had it with Vegas."
3,"I stayed at Aria last week. It&apos;s a decent resort but doesn&apos;t measure up to the best hotels in Las Vegas. 

Aria is located in the CityCenter complex, near Vdara and the Waldorf Astoria. Park MGM and The Cosmopolitan are next door. Within easy walking distance are New York New York, the MGM Grand, and Planet Hollywood. There is also an entrance to the high-end Crystals shoppes near the lobby.

The resort has a modern design with beautiful sculptures and many other unique pieces of art. Check-in via the MGM app was easy, but for some reason the digital key that lets you operate the elevator with your phone wasn&apos;t working for me, so I had to obtain a key at the front desk. There don&apos;t appear to be many elevators up to the rooms, so those were always crowded, particularly the ones going to floors 16-24, which I guess is we&apos;re most regular guest rooms are located. There was regularly a line to access the elevator and people crowding in, despite the ongoing pandemic. If you can stay in another floor, you shouldn&apos;t have any issue. Also, if you don&apos;t want to walk 5 minutes from the elevator to your room, make sure to request a room close to the elevator. Each floor is massive and has hundreds of rooms, so if you get one near the end of the hallway, be prepared for a hike.

The rooms are fine, though not quite what I&apos;d expect for a resort that regularly charges $300 per night. Not as spacious as other similarly priced hotels. Most room functions (turning in the lights, opening the curtains, TV) are controlled via the tablet near the bed. The staff should really leave a visible sign or notice explaining that instead of letting guests fumble around turning switches on and off and hoping that something works. There is no coffee maker of any kind, which is a bit absurd. No wonder the line at the bakery downstairs was a mile long every morning. 
The bathroom is large and has both bathtub and shower in a separate glass enclosure. 

The Strip view rooms have a great view of the Strip and nearby hotels. The bed is fantastic. They sell the bed sheets for $2000 at the resort&apos;s store, so just enjoy them in your room.

Aria has strict COVID measures in place. You must wear a mask at all times inside the resort unless you&apos;re actively eating or drinking. There are free mask stations throughout the casino area. There are numerous hand washing stations also. All restaurants are reservation only so plan ahead, particularly if you want to go to some of the more popular ones. The buffet and pool are closed, but the fitness center is open. Some of the bars and lounges are open, but with limited capacity.

All in all, Aria is a decent resort but there are better options in Las Vegas at this price range."
5,"5 star resort indeed! A++ customer service, fantastic restaurants and the slot machines were on fire! This was our first time here and it won&apos;t be our last!  love this place."
3,"This is a beautiful casino,  my wife really enjoyed all the flowers and beautiful things they have out i think it might be for the Chinese New Year we were told. Very large casino and a serious sky scraper the Aria is. The pool looks super clean and fun but not sure if it was open yet but great design. Not all the restaurants were open yet and many shops were still closed. The only thing that me and my wife saw here at the Aria was some of the visitors were walking around the casino with their pants down below their crotch and butt so maybe security and management should put a stop to this kind of behavior. I recommend a visit to the Aria to all the tourists to experience before you leave Las Vegas."
3,"If you love shopping there&apos;s plenty of that nearby including the &quot;crystals&quot; which is literally next door. If you don&apos;t want to gamble at aria then you need a taxi or lift to get there and like all casinos you have to find where that area is. They all make you hunt for that area hoping you&apos;ll use a taxi. The gambling is not much choice here and the tables can be really expensive ($50 minimum). We have stayed at quite a few casino/hotels and this is mediocre at best, room was small and the &quot;strip view&quot; was a small piece of the road not much else. Housekeeping missed our room one day and the walls are so thin you can hear everything next door. Just pray your neighbor isn&apos;t noisy."
5,"This is definitely one of the better hotels on the strip. And it is centrally located on the strip so walking everywhere is do-able.  The view is amazing if you get a room with a strip view. (Ask for free upgrades when you check in. otherwise, pay the extra money for the strip view. It is well worth it) 

This is definitely one of my top picks for Vegas for hotels. Just because their rooms have big glass windows so you can get an amazing view."
4,I&apos;ve always been a big fan of the Aria. We have had some great times there and had some incredible service. We were there this past weekend and it just wasn&apos;t the same. They just didn&apos;t really seem to care. Part of it is due to Covid and all of the regulations which they can&apos;t help but there was nothing above and beyond like usual. I wouldn&apos;t make a big deal if it was one of the cheaper hotels but this is an upscale location and stay there because of the little things. Hopefully this was just a one off.
2,"So after we had a very dirty room they did let us switch rooms. The gentleman who came up to help us move our bags was wonderful! He was very nice and very helpful. Our new room was clean, so that was an improvement. I spoke to a manager and she was very nice and it was clear she wanted to make things right. So I will give them back a star for the sake of her trying to do the right thing. 

The hotel overall was just okay. The employees were not all that friendly, the restaurants and bars couldn&apos;t ever accommodate seating, the room service stops serving food early then they charge you $10.00 just to have their restaurants bring food up to your room (when the restaurants couldn&apos;t seat us anyway). We normally stay over at the Cosmopolitan and there is just no comparison between the two."
3,"ARRIVAL &amp; PARKING  //  Upon arrival I parked in the parking garage, the wind was blowing it was very cold out. The shortest route from the parking garage to where you check in you have to go down to the ground floor, walk across the whole front of the hotel and into the front doors and the check-in is to your right. It seems somewhat poorly laid out and inconvenient. Or you could walk all the way through the casino through smoke-filled air to get to the check-in area.  Be advised if you&apos;re looking for a view of the Bellagio fountain... it does not exist at Aria according to the front desk.  Security was great, they did verify that I actually have a room, they were very professional and courteous.

ENTRYWAY  //  There were bits and pieces, particles if you will of food on the tiled marble entryway. Yes, I cleaned them up and no they weren&apos;t mine. 

ROOM  //  The room is small. I have a king room, and it&apos;s small. I was very disappointed. If you choose to bring back any kind of food items to dine or order room service in, you will be sitting at a small desk that is directly underneath of the TV.  There&apos;s no kitchen area, there are no plastic disposable cups and the glasses that are here there&apos;s no way to confirm they have been clean, as they are sitting upright with no cover or lid on them. For the record, one was dirty.  Fingerprints on the inside and lint all over the inside. The carpet is stained and looks dirty throughout the unit and the bathroom faucet fixtures either have rust or some kind of stains on them, they just looked plain old.  

There is an odd smell in here, I&apos;m going to make the assumption this is relevant to Covid 19 cleansing. The floor free standing lamp in the corner, the lampshade is broken and askew.  I was unable to upright and balance it.  I think it&apos;s great that hotels have evolved to using iPads for controls. However it probably behooves them to ensure that it actually is charged all the way. My iPad had 27% in in the middle of using it it shut down.  I had to have housekeeping bring me 2 new clean glasses as they have no sealed plastic options.  I also had to have engineering come up to the room to help me move the bed out from the wall to plug in the nightstand lights. They will be back tomorrow at noon to &quot;clean and oil&quot; the curtain track as it is malfunctioning due to dirt having accumulated in the ceiling track. 

BATHROOM  //  The bathroom configuration is a bit strange. You walk through the shower to get to the bathtub. The bathtub is very enclosed. Almost claustrophobic. I am used to a bathtub that&apos;s a little bit more freestanding and spacious regarding the area surrounding it. I also prefer a freestanding shower as well. I found this combination to be awkward at best.  And there is a seating area inside of the shower, there was a strange huge white stain on the bench.   The tub had someone&apos;s pubic hair in it so I had to go to CVS across the street to purchase cleaning items. No way I was going to bathe in a dirty tub.  

AMBIENT NOISE  //  with the air conditioner off, I was clearly able to hear people walking up and down the hallway having very medium level conversation. With the air conditioning on I could clearly hear children running back-and-forth. I heard my neighbor drop their keys twice on the floor next to me and housekeeping conversing about after work plans with their children while passing the room. In my experience, you should not be able to hear these sorts of noises and sounds. There should be a better sound barrier.

ENGINEERING // I required assistance from engineer in twice. The lights on the nightstands were not working. I had already attempted to troubleshoot on my own, to no avail. I contacted the front desk, they kept insisting I didn&apos;t know how to use the iPad. I kept clarifying it wasn&apos;t a user issue. It was some thing on an electrical/mechanical basis. They finally agreed to send engineer in to my room. Engineering arrived, and stated &quot;I hear you need to learn how to use the iPad&quot;. I explained to him I completely understand how to use an iPad. The problem emanates from an electrical connection somewhere. He had to pull the king size bed out from the wall, and located the problem which was an electrical connection. While they were there I asked him if it was normal for the sheer curtains and the black out curtains to require 12 individual pushes on the iPad to get them to either open or close. He explained to me the jerking and the delay was due to a dirty track and it requiring to be oiled. I scheduled for the next day at noon for them to come in while I was out of the room to remedy the situation.

I have previously stayed at many MGM properties and never encountered or experienced any issues or problems to this level. I can honestly tell you I will not be frequenting the Aria until they get their act together. This does not appear to be a five star hotel."
5,"Aria is a beautiful resort and casino! Perfectly located on the center of the strip, super modern, with plenty of dining and shopping options. Best part of the trip was being able to get up and go where we pleased without having to worry about being too far out. 

The pool and fitness center was open, coming in clutch for anyone trying to get a workout or tanning session. Due to COVID masks are required at all times unless you are eating or drinking at the moment.

Hospitality provided by the staff members were above par and truly impressive. Definitely will be a returning guest and highly recommend others to make their future reservations."
5,"Aria is one of my favorite locations to stay at in Vegas. The rooms are modern and the electronic controls for room settings (lights, temp, curtains, etc) are neat. It is a more upscale feel with great dining options. Large pool area and a quick walk to the Crystal shops next door."
4,"Just like a lot of people. I like reading reviews of places before actually going there.
I was so skeptical of staying here due to a lot of the bad reviews from other reviewers. 
BUT I shall say we enjoyed our stay, and didn&apos;t have any negative experience. Which I&apos;m so glad.

The main thing I was SUPER EXCITED about was their in house robot that delivers your food and coffee to your room, but they stopped that due to COVID! I was bummed  but not a deal breaker. 

The check in process was not stressful at all, and we didn&apos;t have to wait long to be helped. The front desk attendant who helped my husband was really polite. We checked in early, and she was so pleasant to deal with. So sorry we didn&apos;t get your name to put on our review. 

We stayed on the 51st floor, and the view was AMAZING! Our little 2 year old son loved it, and enjoyed the huge window, and view he has.
The rooms are taped off to show that they were sanitized for our safety. 
Upon going into the room I checked the restroom, towels, and our bedsheets, because I saw some people had bad reviews that they checked into a room that was filthy! But Ours were clean! 
They give you a complimentary &quot;Covid sanitizer kit&quot; that comes with a big tube of sanitizer, two masks, and two no touch keychains that a lot of places are either selling them for $5-$10 each. So thank you for that, Aria! Lol 

They enforce masks, which we have no issues with. Hey we&apos;ve been on this pandemic for several months now. People should know that wearing a mask is a must in public. 

I&apos;ve seen workers sanitizing the machines. We did like that there is a worker before you enter the elevators to make sure you have a key. You need your room key to access your floor, and it&apos;ll only access the floor you&apos;re staying on. Which we had no issues. Due to safety. 

The only thing that bummed us. Is that A LOT of the restaurants at the Aria closes early. The only place open was the Patisserie, so if you want real food you have to get it else where. What we did is just ordered from DoorDash. Which was a bummer, because after playing tourist, and we got to our room. We wanted to get food at a place in the Aria. So just keep that in mind. When going back to your hotel room. 

Other than that we enjoyed our stay."
5,Spent a few days at aria and it was amazing. Resort looks beautiful and staff members were very professional and accommodating. I would say that the walk from their garage was kinda far from the actual elevators that lead to your room. I would recommend if you have a lot of luggage to drop it off first at the main lobby then parking your car. I would definitely stay here again since it has a good central location to everything on th e strip
5,"Spent a few days here and felt like it was the best decision! You&apos;re right in the middle of everything and the hotel itself is huge and gorgeous, never running out of things to do. We loved it and would recommend it to anyone!"
4,"Really nice resort in Vegas. They have beautiful pools, a variety of restaurants, and a nice spa/gym. They are also pet friendly which is a plus. The rooms are luxurious and have offer a spa like bathroom. Our only issue was with the blinds and lights in our room and although they said they would fix the issue they did not. We ended up having to sleep with the blinds open."
4,The place looks great and this night is even perfect. There was not a whole lot of people tonight. I came here to night to visit the sugar house for Christmas that a lot of people was raving about. But to my surprise it was smaller than I thought. Aria is a great hotel . They have great restaurants here and the ambience is so nice. Due to Covid the tram that connects this hotel to go the other sister hotels around the area is not working currently. But is still suggest to visit this hotel and casino. Ill will be back here.
5,"This hotel is super cute and posh! How is this my first time staying here! I&apos;ve been hearing about the rants and how great this hotel is and my brother loves this hotel and stays here every time. so finally got to check them out. 

I just want to say I was not disappointed at all. They have a great selection of food, bars, the club is here but closed, and best of all they are right smack dap in the middle of the strip adjacent to crystals mall. best of all is that doordash even delivers here while we were staying here back in OCt."
