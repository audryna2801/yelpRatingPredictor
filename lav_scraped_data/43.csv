4,"We stayed here over the weekend and it was overall a good stay! The pool was closed which was a bummer because they have a beautiful fish tank in the middle with sharks swimming around the tank! Such a beautiful sight. We stayed in the Carson tower. I room was overall okay a bit dirty but not too much to complain about. We were sure either way to sanitize our own door handles etc. since it was super bowl weekend they offered the game in the room which was really neat since getting a table at the Circa meant you would have to pay 10,000$! They are crazy! I would stay here again if I was staying in the old strip. Oh major score about this hotel is they have a Chik- Fila by the Carson tower!!!!!"
5,"Golden Nugget is an upscale hotel, casino, and resort in the Fremont St area, and possibly the largest one. I didn&apos;t stay at the hotel, but I did visit the casino and many of the shops. 

Standard casino safety measures. Hand sanitizer stations everywhere. Masks required. Employees wore masks. 

The pool was pretty crowded. I would stay away from there."
4,"The mister and I came to Vegas during COVID for a wedding of one of his very close friends.  It was a small wedding (total 12 people + bride and groom).
They were all staying here at the Nugget so obviously we stayed here also. 
I haven&apos;t stayed in this area before and only briefly visited once (25 years ago). 
I am so glad that I got to experience old Vegas.  
Because of COVID we actually spent quite a bit of time in the room.  We left for the wedding, dinner both nights and breakfast one day.   We went out on Fremont on night one and it was a bit too crowded for me to feel comfortable.  
The bed was comfy
the couch was comfy
the AC was cranking! 

the pool was closed so that was a bummer ...but it&apos;s probably better That we avoided the crowds.

If I find myself a need to return to this part of Vegas..I would definitely stay here again"
5,"This review is not for staying at the Golden Nugget, just for my experience as a passerby visitor!

It looks like they&apos;ve merged some modernization changes in with the historical upscale casino vibe. The casino is energetic and lively. There was nicely a bar off to the side near check-in that provided a quiet place to stop and have a drink. The bartender was great...I wish I could remember his name - Carlos maybe? I remember my drink being delicious!

There are bars and servers in the casino as well. Since I was just surveying the surroundings I loved this bar because you could see the pool and water slide and aquarium walls if you looked out the window. 

Casino is easily accessible through Freemont street. I shopped room and prices seemed in line with what we were paying on our visit. The rooms looked nice and updated from the photos and I&apos;d be interested in staying here on a future Visit!

Sometimes the Fremont St Experience can be a little overwhelming and crowded, but I think the Golden Nugget might be a nice choice to duck into from the hubbub of the street!"
1,"Management is incredibly rude and unprofessional. Do not stay here as it is unsafe!

Most of the negative reviews are pretty on point. But I was desperate for a place and settled here."
5,"Did a Video Review ! loved my room even though i barely stayed in it besides to sleep and shower lol

https://youtu.be/ZhPLxVEAnmM"
1,Seriously I wish I could give a negative star for this place I watched a boy die tonight and the staff and security just watched it happen I will never stay at this place ever again and I&apos;m gonna do all I can in that boys memory to make sure that everybody knows what they did and if the security guard who watched and was more interested in threatening me sees this post you know who you are you POS you will burn in hell after karma does you in
2,Good speed of drinks for table games but I told the pitboss that the loudmouthed old guy with a small dog that looked like a panhandler was secretly panhandling.  They have little control over guests except for strict mask enforcement.  I wish they enforced overbearing vagrants getting in my wife&apos;s face at a slot.  Doesn&apos;t Tilman Fertita own this?  That&apos;s why I go to Chart House for his standards.
5,"The Golden Nugget opened in 1946. Like many other hotels during that time looking to capitalize on Nevada&apos;s Gold Rush legacy. 
Including a young investor named Steve Wynn who took majority ownership in 1973. Although the Nugget was still profitable Steve Wynn sold his venture to Timothy Poster and Thomas Breitling in 2003. The two entrepreneurs had no previous casino ownership experience. However they were one of the first to found a internet travel site named Travelscape.com The two best friends sold that concept to another company which is known today as Expedia.com  A year later their story became the basis for the Casino television series. In 2005 Houston based Landry&apos;s Restaurant. The original partner Tilman Fertitta became President and CEO. Over the years Landry&apos;s Inc expanded their acquisitions by acquiring household name companies such as Joes Crab Shack, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, Rainforest Cafe, and Morton&apos;s Steakhouse. Fertitta became known as Forbes Richest Restauranteur. 
If Fremont Street was a Yellow Brick Road. It certainly has led to the address of 129 East Fremont. The Home Of Golden Opportunities."
5,"Why are you even reading this review? Of course you&apos;re going to go to the Nugget. Stop pretending like every person in your group isn&apos;t secretly rooting for someone else to say it. Go. Go now. Gamble. Enjoy. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy New Year to you!"
3,"Still my favorite downtown hotel/casino, but our stay in a Rush Tower Corner Suite was much less impressive than our previous stay in a Rush Tower Gold Club room, and it cost more!

Thought I&apos;d splurge and get a suite for my boyfriend&apos;s birthday. I knew the finishes were going to be less our style but thought the extra space would make up for that. It didn&apos;t. On top of not being fans of the decor, much of the furniture in the room was worn, old looking, and/or stained. Imperfections in the tv stand were literally taped over in an attempt to hide it, I wish I had gotten a photo, it was so tacky considering the price point of the room! Since we were on a corner, we had two roads on two sides of the room and lots of street noise coming through the walls from the Plaza side all night. We won&apos;t be staying in this room type again but if you choose to do so, I&apos;d suggest bringing ear plugs.

We actually split our stay between the GN and the Cosmopolitan. We had a deal (not comped! we have no status at Cosmo!) that made our incredible, modern 1 bedroom suite at the Cosmopolitan cost about $100 LESS than this considerably less nice room at the GN. If the price point was less or at least comparable, it would be easier to overlook many of these things but for a premium price tag, we expect a premium room and this was not. We do not have money to blow and like to see value when we spend it - we did not get that here. We have stayed all over Fremont and both of us agreed we could have gotten a room of this quality anywhere else, for less $.

I used to recommend the Golden Nugget without hesitation but after staying in this room type, there will definitely be disclaimers. Rooms are NOT created equal, and more money doesn&apos;t mean a better room. Do your research! I don&apos;t think I was active on yelp at the time of our last stay but I would rate our Rush Tower Gold Club room/stay five stars!

If my review was based on the room alone, this would be a 1-2 star review. Luckily the GN has a great casino area, awesome overall vibe, and plenty of restaurant choices/variety that help average it out to a 3.

* Forgot to publish a draft so this review is a bit late. We stayed here in July."
2,"Upgraded, no coffee pot, room was NOT clean, no fridge. Do not upgrade. Free parking, large room, good restaurants"
2,"The Nugget has gone down hill. I&apos;ve stayed here once a year for the past 7-8 years and really took  a turn between last year and this year.

Check-in service was not very nice and my room booking a somehow got changed from a king to 2 doubles- lovely for my wife and I instead of sleeping together.

For a mere additional $40 bucks on top of the ridiculous resort fee I could get a king. Pfft. Instead of getting $40 how about if I just don&apos;t come back anymore.  Well played."
4,"This was a nice stop on our way though town. It was nice that they were pet friendly and the staff and security were nice. I know they were dealing with a lot during this COVID time and they did a pretty good job. 

The reason I only gave 4 stars is because the hotel is very dated. The windows in the room were very dirty on the outside to the point it was hard to see outside. The room was dated, but clean. If they update things this could be a very nice spot. 

The Tank (I.e. the hotel pool) was fun although the slide wasn&apos;t open. There were a lot of fish in that little tank. I&apos;m not sure what kind of fish they are so hopefully some marine biologists have studied the architecture of the tank and determine that the fish are happy that close together. I like to imagine they are happy fish."
5,Manda makes it better! Thank you for such a great time. And we appreciate your utmost hospitality.
1,"This used to be my favorite casino for gambling in Downtown Vegas because I loved to play blackjack by The Tank.  It was awesome to be &quot;outside&quot; watching the sharks with no smoke around. Well during the pandemic times The Tank tables weren&apos;t open for either of our visits.  I really wasn&apos;t comfortable sitting at a table playing blackjack with people not wearing masks because they were smoking and drinking; so I decided to play the video poker/video blackjack.  Our first night gambling no cocktail waitress came by to take drink orders, but it was a Saturday night &amp; a little busier.  It was still  o.k. even though I lost like $20 bucks.....but that&apos;s not the casinos fault.  

Our next visit sucked!  First of all we ate at  the Cadillac Bar; which was just fair.  (We had better Mexican food at Chayo on the Strip a few nights before.). After dinner we decided to play some more video blackjack.  A cocktail waitress quickly came by &amp; I ordered a Bud Light.....seemed a simple enough order and they weren&apos;t super busy.  Well we sat there, same area, for 45 minutes and she never came back and no other waitress came by either!

The worst thing was that while playing video blackjack; my machine just went black in the middle of my playing.  We hit the &quot;service&quot; button &amp; figured someone would come, or at least the girl would come by, and she would get help....but like I mentioned she ghosted us.  After about 5-10 minutes the machine just went back on; so silly me, I continued playing because we were waiting for my beer &amp;  didn&apos;t want to move.  Well, guess what?  It went black again, so we again hit the &quot;service&quot; button.  No one came, but when I saw an employee in a black suit I flagged her down and told her what happened.  She said the machine should power back up in a few minutes &amp; that it has been happening all day!  Then why not shut it down?! I mean the machine right next to it was closed for social distancing....why not put that one on???  Well, it didn&apos;t power up &amp; she sent a gentleman over.  He told me to hit &quot;deal/draw&quot; and then &quot;cash out&quot; to get my card back.  This meant I lost my current bet....,which at this point I didn&apos;t remember what I had and what &quot;the dealer&quot; had.  Of course I lost my bet....probably only $.50 or a dollar, but I didn&apos;t have the option to think about a good gamble.  I asked the gentleman &quot;So I just had to lose that bet &amp; he said yes, and then put an &quot;out of order&quot; sticker on the machine and walked away.  And still no drink!!!!!

What TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I mean I&apos;m not a big gambler: but would easily gamble $100-$200 in the course of a week, plus dining in the casino.  I just can&apos;t believe he didn&apos;t give me a voucher for a free drink, $20 free play....something.  Not even an apology or a thank you for being patient!"
1,"Wow, the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas has really gone downhill with their customer service.  I have always said the Golden Nugget is my favorite hotel in the downtown Freemont area.  They always made me feel like they were a high class gem.  All the customer service is gone.  They are not at 30 percent in that casino, no way, but service is at 30 percent. 

I will take my dollars to the strip or a station casino. I am not coming to mess with this any more."
4,"Hands down our favorite DTLV hotel-pool-casino.

The pool is one of the best in Vegas, with solid food &amp; drink selection at a fraction of strip-prices, and fantastic service (thank you, Sophie!). I would not recommend the poolside blackjack, but do enjoy the premier attraction: a mid-pool, glass shark tank with a transparent water slide running through it that makes Shark Week seem, well, dull.

We stayed in the lower-tier Carson Tower (comped), but you wouldn&apos;t know it by the spacious, comfortable rooms. Extra points for free in-room bottled water, something no hotel on the strip provides, which to me, in the Vegas heat, is like seeing a drowning man and politely inviting him back up on the boat for a life preserver. Additionally, as a self-proclaimed shower connoisseur, I must...dare I say...shower praise on Golden Nugget&apos;s high pressure shower heads. 

The casino floor is one of the best downtown, although a bit claustrophobic compared to the palatial floors on the strip. Table games have a low house edge, but higher minimums than many other downtown games (don&apos;t miss the $5-10 single deck blackjack at El Cortez)."
5,"Golden Nugget is an expansive resort filled with cool things to see and do. 

You get the &quot;bigness&quot; of the Strip with the charm of Fremont st. You can roam around the property and find cool bars, restaurants, aquariums. 

I know from spending way too much time online that a lot of people want to try Chick-fil-A but don&apos;t live close to one. 

There&apos;s one inside the Golden Nugget.

The Nugget is located smack dab in the middle of the Fremont St. Experience so you&apos;re within walking distance to pretty much everything downtown Vegas has to offer."
1,"My company&apos;s travel agency booked a room at this hotel for my business trip.  The rate charged by my travel agency was approx $138.99.  When I got to the hotel, they had a hard time pulling up my reservation  After 20 minutes of looking for it, the front desk rep told me they could not find the reservation and that they would need to charge me directly for a room if I wished to stay there.  They gave me a rate of $116.39.  I agreed to it and gave them my credit card.  Next day, I called my company&apos;s travel agent and asked them to cancel the booking and give me a refund.  

When I checked out, I noticed that the hotel had added a fee to my bill.  Turns out my travel agent called them to inquire on my reservation, the hotel realized that they billed me less that what the travel agent had originally booked, and then charged the difference.  I called Golden Nugget to ask about the additional fee, and they said they could not refund me the difference because the booking was done through a 3rd party, which they could not find at the time of my check in, but found out after the travel agent called them.   

This is absolutely bad business and borderline illegal.  The difference is not a lot, but they should not be charging more without an explanation or without my authorization.  They quoted me a rate at the desk, I had agreed on a rate and paid for it.  I&apos;m not ever staying at this hotel again!!!  Crooks!"
