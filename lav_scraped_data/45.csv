5,"We have stayed in MGM, Aria, New York NY and the Mirage. The Venetian is our favorite resort.

In a covid environment, they cleaned everything including the escalator rail.

They have impressive hiring practices because everyone from the front desk to the waiters and housecleaning were Amazingly kind.

Our room was brilliant. Big, comfortable and clean.

Absolutely our &quot;go to&quot; next time."
4,"During Covid19, we stayed at the Venetian Hotel. The hotel really made the effort to keep us safe, by keeping everything clean and had tight security. The hotel staff were so polite and helpful towards keeping the surrounding area clean. 

Right when you walk in there were free mask and hand sanitizer, along with people constantly cleaning the most highly touch surfaces. I was impressed, because you didn&apos;t see this in other hotels. 

The reason for the four stars was our hotel room was dark. Our view was good a glimpse of the water/fire show at the Belliago across the street and the linq was close by so we were close to other attraction, such as shopping, eating and entertainment for the family. We explore across the street and visit the dolphins and tigers. Pretty cool. Another attraction for us was the large indoor shopping area inside the Venetian, which kept me entertained with my little one. So many opportunities to get your steps in. 

I purchased the Gondola. My little one and my partner really enjoyed it. There was no personal serenade, but they had a musician at each end that serenaded us. We purchased the inside Gondola. The Gondola outside was close During this time. The Gondola was a quick 10 min ride for $80 (3 ppl) I believe its a capacity of 4 people plus the guide. It was a beautiful experience for us.

I really enjoyed the spa, pool and lounge area at theVenetian. It was clean. There are so many eating areas in this hotel, but there is a healthy eating area near the spa and gym. 

There were several pool areas at the Venetian, but our favorite was the heated pool even though it was 70 degrees out. The pool area was huge, with several life guards on site and a bar. I enjoyed the family restroom which helps when you have a small child. The restroom had showers to freshen up. 

Enjoy."
5,"Husband and I stayed here January of 2021. We are typically Mlife members and fans but he has the Grazie card aka their players card and got an offer too good to pass down!

Check in was all electronic which was super easy! Even their keys were electronic if you wished. To get through on the elevators you did have to scan your hotel key for a light to turn green which their wifi was so spotty that we needed to visit the front desk to get actual room keys.

The room itself was large, comfortable and had all the necessities! We didn&apos;t have a fancy room by any means and it still had a step down seating area, couch, 3 tvs, large grand bath tub and a vanity area. 

We were on the 5th floor which was nice because we weren&apos;t in their main tower part which required mile long walk to the room!

We did find a random qtip on the floor that wasn&apos;t ours and a few black hairs that again weren&apos;t ours. Not exactly what you want to see during covid times.

The beds were comfy the bathtubs were fabulous and the location of this hotel is great. Right across from mirage and not far at all from fashion show mall etc. 

They have the canal shops, great casino lots of smokers there i noticed this time but overall a great hotel especially for the fact that it&apos;s 22 years old you would never be able to tell"
4,"In the summer of 2020 The Venetian offered a free night&apos;s stay to first responders. At the time my wife worked at a hospital, which earned her a free night&apos;s stay. At the time I worked as a security officer in another Las Vegas casino, which also earned a free night&apos;s stay. To add to our enjoyment our 11 and 13 year old daughter&apos;s also got to stay. Four people, two nights at the Venetian, for free! Like it or not, that was pretty awesome.  

Our view form the room wasn&apos;t the greatest. Unless you like looking at air conditioning units.  There were two televisions in the room. If both are turned on, good luck. The pools on the property were very shallow, not much for swimming. The property does offer things to do for minors, but it does come with a price. Enough restaraunts to offer a little something for everyone&apos;s appetite."
2,"Terrible service.  We had reservations for the main Venetian Hotel, and when we got here they said that they needed to move us to the Palazzo portion of their hotel as an &quot;upgrade&quot;. 
this was not an upgrade! It was a 15 minute walk with heavy luggage, and it put us behind the building and not on the main strip the entire time we were here.  
So we had to walk far every day just to get to anywhere. 

They have no shuttle to and from the airport &quot;due to covid&quot;. Most everyone else has their shuttles up and running. 

If I were you, I wouldn&apos;t even come to Las Vegas right now during Covid. The service frankly everywhere is just bad with so many restrictions. And if you do, you&apos;re going to have to make a reservation for the lamest places to even get in.  

The maid service was wonderful, and that&apos;s why we&apos;re giving it to stars, and not one."
5,"I&apos;ve been to The Venetian many times for shopping, eating, sightseeing, shows and concerts. This past recent Christmas Day 2020 was my first time staying here due to their promotion for essential workers as I&apos;m in the pharmaceutical industry.  Check-in was simple via a link they send me through text. My room was actually ready earlier than promise, but we didn&apos;t actually check-in til early evening.  I just had to pick up my key cards in the shorter line towards the right that&apos;s marked mobile check-in.  Self parking was free but I think this is because due to Covid.  We also got a welcome pack of 2 face masks, 2 small wipes and hand sanitizer in our room.

Since the room was comp we just overlooked the top of a shorter building which was fine.  I assume this is just their any &quot;normal&quot; room but it was really spacious and comfortable on the 5th floor! The bathroom was as big as someone&apos;s bedroom, the bedroom was in the middle, then couple steps down to the living room with sofa and a small dining room table with 4 chairs so we can enjoy our take-out dinner comfortably.  There&apos;s also a TV in the living room, bedroom and the bathroom!  Check-out next morning was contactless via text.  

Staying at The Venetian a great start to our 8 days road stop.  Wish we had more time than just one night here.  I also recommend eating at their Lobster Me and stocking up French macarons at Buchon bakery. Note: There&apos;s a charge for ANY of the water and snacks when you move them."
4,"I had a reservation last Friday night for the palazzo and they had the hotel closed for hotel rooms. Bummer. They had me stay at the Venetian for the night and although clean, I still wished for the palazzo. I checked in late about 9 pm and there was a line at the registration that had me wait about 25 minutes. Every single party we crossed paths with had the same issue of being lost walking throughout the Venetian towers. It&apos;s confusing with different parts of the hallways leading to different leveled floors. The rooms are designed the same as palazzo with just older euro type decor - it felt outdated but the beds were decently comfy and room tidy. The room also came with a sanitation kit."
4,"Our first time staying here.  The rooms were clean.   Especially important during Covid.  My only complaint about the room was the lighting in the bathroom.  I&apos;m not terribly in to hair and makeup, yet still found it too dark to my liking.  I&apos;m sure this has to be a frequent complaint from other women!  

Casino Floor... during our stay hotels, casinos, and restaurants were to have 25% capacity due to Covid numbers in Nevada.  The casino floor was packed!  Valet was full.  And we always had more than 4 guests trying to get on the elevator at once.  This let us know the hotel was running higher than 25%.  Just a heads up if you are thinking the Venetian hotel would be a ghost town.  It&apos;s not.  The Palazzo was!  

Otherwise, no complaints.  And we will probably stay here again if the rooms can get brighter lighting."
5,"During my trip to Las Vegas, I ended up playing here the most at both the Palazzo and Venetian.  

If you are new and play quite a bit, I would sign up as their free play is very generous compared to most places.  I do not understand their point system at all, but I did ended up getting over 47,000 points and I ended up getting around $200 dollar worth of slot play which was nice as I used it to get back my loses.  I ended up playing their for 12 hours I would say going back and forth from the Palazzo.  They have this big even in November for members as I racked up a lot of points, but I wonder if I can order the stuff online as mentioned.  I had a very good day as I was able to get around $700 dollars worth of winnings only to loose back $400 in an hour and a half.  My bets are usually around $1.50 to $2.40 range depending on the game.

The slots here they have a good assortment of them.  I played the Lightning Link the most, Boost, Lightning Link, Buffalo. Those are my favorite games I enjoy to play.  The casino floor can get crowded around 1 to 3 pm however. I would recommend gambling here because the comps are sweet.  They have Heidi and Hannah and the Diamonds are a girl best friend.  Lots of Buffalo as well.

Unfortunately, I found out they had now they had a glitch in the system over the weekend so I ended up getting only 4700 points.  I am assuming 1 point per dollar play sounds right since I spent 4 days there.  So no gold status anymore.  But I enjoyed the free play and they during that time and in return they got me to gamble quite a bit and got back their money I won from them."
5,"I can totally see why this place is so highly rated as a hotel. My friends and I stayed here on my most recent visit and totally fell in love with the place. I&apos;ve stayed all over the strip and this has taken the spot as my favorite at the moment. We were able to get killer rates as first responders. Check in was so easy and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They gave us the best rooms close together and even offered decent priced upgrades which we declined due to not planning on being in the rooms too much.

We were first blown away by the rooms. They aren&apos;t as modern as some of the newer hotels, but they make up for that with elegance and class.  I especially loved the space in the rooms. There was so much space for activities!!  My room is usually the gathering spot and it was comfortable for all. I don&apos;t typically sleep well away from home but I slept like a baby here. 

Now on to the Venetian other than the hotel. This place is massive and has so much to offer. You really do not have to leave. I imagine outside of Covid restrictions, you can totally spend a few days in here and not get bored. On separate visits I have enjoyed Tao and shows which were incredible. We explored, ate and gambled and really enjoyed this place. The shops and gondola rides are a must see as well. 

It&apos;s going to be hard for me to stick to my rule of not staying somewhere twice in Vegas. I may have to just become a regular here!"
5,"My boyfriend and I took a weekend vacation here might I say this was the nicest hotel I&apos;ve been in and I&apos;ve stayed at the Omni and the Carlton so I am no stranger to nice things 
Everything and everyone was so nice and welcoming 
Made me want to just move to Vegas 
Food was great so place was very clean 
Maids were nice 
The pool was a lil crowded but that was ok they&apos;re connected to the palazzo and they allowed us to use both poools"
5,"Comparing to the other hotels we have been to in Las Vegas, the Venetian hit the point.
The check out was fast but during checking in. We had a question regarding which exit or door usually the tour buses pick up the guests, she actually didn&apos;t know and she referred us to go ask the security!! Anyway, our room was spacious and even though we avid extra for a view. The view wasn&apos;t worth the money. It was kind off the strip and still overlooking the roof of small buildings in the front. they placed a cleaning kit in the room which had a sanitizer and face masks.
The room gets cleaned every morning, which is not happening lately with many hotels
They charge resort fee and the parking is free.
The only downside is the location. It is kind of at the end of the strip, not in the heart of the strip.
It is like 20 minutes walking to the bellagio"
4,"Beautiful clean hotel. The room was spacious and comfortable. I had 2 queen beds, and a small living room area with a desk, sofa, and 2nd tv. It was like a small timeshare resort room minus the kitchen.

Pros:
- spacious beautiful room
- huge bathroom with shower and hot tub
- living room had a tv, as well as bed area
- complimentary valet (one of the few left on the strip)

Cons:
- it would have been nice to have a small coffee maker in the room with complimentary coffee
- using the elevators were a hassle. Due to social distancing, only 4 are allowed at a time so a line forms, people would constantly cut the line. It would have been nice to have someone regulating the line"
4,"Overall I really enjoyed my stay at the Venetian. It&apos;s the perfect amount of kitsch and luxury for a weekend trip to Las Vegas.

We were thrilled with our room. The rooms are huge - each room is a suite with a little sunken living room. It has enough seating for a group and is a perfect pregame area! And the bathrooms are large as well!

We came during COVID, and I felt they took proper precautions. Elevators were limited to 4 people per car (only monitored for cars departing the lobby level). They were sanitizing commonly used surfaces between guests, like the check-in desk. There were sanitizer stations around the lobby and casino. They were monitoring to make sure guests were wearing masks. All table games in the casinos had plexiglass between each player and between players and the dealer. Each hotel room was provided with a little pouch including disposable masks, wipes, and sanitizer. I really loved that they tried to make their guests feel safe! Good job Venetian!

The cons - also because of COVID, the pool was at limited capacity. Because it was a busy weekend, we were told we had to be put on the waitlist, with no estimate for how long until there would be availability at the pool. This was frustrating since we were really looking forward to experience this part of Vegas. Luckily, Venetian guests have access to the Palazzo pool. The wait turned out to be shorter there and their pool had more sunlight anyways, so it worked out for us!"
5,"Even though there are some slight reasons that I could take off a star for The Venetian, I won&apos;t because it is just that amazing! I stayed here at the end of October 2020 and had a wonderful time. To say that this place is huge, beautiful, and luxurious  in its design is an understatement. All of the rooms are suites here. Every. Room. That&apos;s hard to beat, especially on the strip. The room and everywhere here honestly was very clean.

Pandemic Safety: I was here during the pandemic and this hotel took every measure to keep people safe. There are hand sanitizer stations every 10 feet on the main lobby/casino floor, and at every elevator bay. The tables are limited to four people at a time and once someone gets up, a card is placed advising the cleaning crew (who is constantly circulating) to come clean in that area. There are chairs at every other slot machine to ensure social distancing. Inside of the room, you&apos;re given a cleaning/safety amenity kit that has disposable face masks, wipes, and hand sanitizer which was great. A security guard sits at the main entrances of the hotel to monitor a thermal scanner for everyone who enters. Elevators are restricted to four people at a time and there are attendants there monitoring that this is done.

Criticisms: As I mentioned, this place is HUGE! For that reason, it seems like you have to walk a mile to get almost anywhere here. It&apos;s a mile from the front entrance/lobby to get to the elevators to get to your room, and another mile to get from your room to the rideshare pick-up place. Restaurants are pretty pricey. In that this is a luxury hotel, it&apos;s to be expected that the restaurants aren&apos;t cheap, and to be fair, there is a food court with cheaper fast food alternatives. In the pool area, I wasn&apos;t told upon entry where the towels were even though you have to check in at a table to gain access to the pool. For this reason, once I got settled and ready to go swimming, I had to take an eight minute walk to go back to the entrance to get towels. smh 

These are minor inconveniences and annoyances and not worth taking a star away from the review. They&apos;re just things to make note of.  I would love to stay here again on a future stay! I&apos;ve been to Vegas five times and have stayed at different hotels every time (Planet Hollywood, Flamingo, Treasure Island, and the El Cortez Boutique Hotel). This is hands down my favorite."
5,"One of the nicest resorts in Las Vegas - I&apos;ve stayed here several times and have yet to experience and explore everything it has to offer.

All of the restaurants and lounges have been phenomenal.

All the rooms (suites) are generously spacious and comfortable with multiple TVs.

Has a large poker and gaming area and a ton of shops and stores.

During covid they have done an outstanding job with safety precautions"
5,"We were very happy and pleased with our stay at tge Venetian. Room was good, parking good, kids had a blast. The suite had plenty of room to spread out. Housekeeping was done once and she did great!"
4,"This is our first stay here since the pandemic (last trip to Vegas was in March 2020).  

First the bad:  currently at least, the crowd in Vegas and at the Venetian is far less upscale than prior to the pandemic.  Sure, no one expects everyone to dress up the way they did in Frank Sinatra&apos;s time, but just the way many people dress and act in Vegas right now, including thankfully isolated but increasing incidents of violence on the Strip, is not edifying.

Now, is this lower end crowd in the VIP areas and high roller player rooms?  No - so, if you want a high end experience you may still get it, but just seeing the way Vegas has gone downhill is disappointing.

As far as our stay, over a week in an almost 2000 square foot suite on the top floor with its own exercise room and wet sauna, what&apos;s not to like?  Even the standard rooms at the Venetian are large compared to what other Vegas resorts offer (standard room at Venetian - 650 sq. ft., on par with the 745 sq. ft. standard rooms at Encore), so as far as accommodations, Venetian is high up there in Vegas rank.

We were here more to relax than gamble. 

The shower steams have been removed from all of the suites, but ours had a fantastic cedar wet sauna that got as hot as you would want it to be.

A lot of the furniture in the Venetian rooms is genuine Drexel Heritage or the like, solid wood, not like the particle board stuff you will find at most every other hotel.  An update to the carpet, which is starting to show its age, might be in order.

Service seems a bit slower these days as perhaps the hotel is understaffed, but everything is taken care of well, and safely.  Everything in the room is clearly sanitized (even glasses come shrink wrapped), and room service is available with contactless delivery at the door.  All the restaurants are open, although some have limited hours and days.

Thankfully, paper menus (for room service) remain in the room- it&apos;s hard to navigate some of these online only (via the television) order systems.

Although housekeeping is trying to stay out of rooms when guests are inside, we had no problem with having our staff clean while we were there.  It helped that we were in a suite, we&apos;d just stay in one side while they worked the other.  Staff always wore gloves and masks, and we kept our masks on whenever interacting with anyone.

Masks are thankfully mandatory everywhere, although you will find a few trying to skirt the regulations here and there, such as in the Canyon Ranch gym which is definitely the largest and best equipped hotel gym I have experienced anywhere in the world - complete with everything from free weights, to the latest Technogym strength conditioning equipment, TRX straps and even a forty foot climbing wall.  Generally the people whom you see trying to take their masks off or slip them down around their chins are part of the same lower end crowd that has infiltrated Vegas in general of late. 

No smoking at any of the table games, although smoking is still allowed elsewhere in the casino.  The movement towards no smoking casinos has begun!

The Venetian has seven pools, and the next door Palazzo has eleven.  The Canyon Ranch spa&apos;s wet areas (steam, sauna, all communal rooms) are closed during the pandemic, so there is no point to a day pass, but spa treatments such as massages and skin care are still available.

Valet is now open again, although with the long wait at times to get a valet, you might be better off just dropping off your bags with the bellman if you have a lot of luggage, and then self parking.  Venetian&apos;s parking remains free for everyone.

If you are looking for a getaway, whether to gamble or just relax, Venetian is still one of the best and most luxurious spots on the strip.  Just be careful out there - especially at night."
5,"Great Covid-19 safety measures in place!

My bf and I have stayed at the Venetian (in the Venetian tower) before and loved it.  This time, we stayed in the Palazzo tower on the 50th floor, the Paiza Club level.  The suite was amazing.  It had a large living room, 2 restrooms, a bedroom, vanity area, and a large walk-in closet.  It was 2000 square feet and housed a piano, 5 televisions, a jacuzzi tub, and pool table.  The automated window coverings were a nice touch.  Being the highest floor in the state of Nevada, the view was spectacular.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 

Despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, we felt very safe.  They seemed to have taken all precautions- plexi-glass everywhere (bathroom sinks, casino tables, etc), every other slot closed off to allow for distancing, masks enforced, elevator capacity limited to 4, hand sanitizer dispensers everywhere, thermal scanning at elevator bays to rooms, people stationed at high touch areas assigned just to wipe down whatever was touched...  
Cleanliness throughout the hotel and casino were immaculate.  We were impressed.  

The well equipped fitness center was open with limited hours and capacity but capacity was quite large at 45.   Masks were required.  Hand sanitizer and wipe stations were located throughout the center.  The fitness center employee did periodic checks and sanitation sprays of the equipment.  

Security to the tower was great.  Security was stationed on the first floor in front of the elevator bay and you needed scan your room card to pass them.  

Service was outstanding.  We checked in on the Venetian side with Michael.  Michael was professional, friendly, super personable, down to earth, and helpful.  Other staff we encountered from housekeeping to security were wonderful, too.

The Venetian scored itself another 5+ rating for this visit."
1,"The hotel always nice, however this new year eve. We check in late around 2am. The front desk lady told us that they don&apos;t have anything left on the Venetian tower, so we paid 150$ for the upgraded room. The room was big and nice but it was disgusting. I saw these hairs in the restroom. But I was too tired since it&apos;s already 5am. I decided to just go to bed after shower regardless. After couple hours of sleep, I get ready to leave and saw the pillow was full of makeup..... 
I did not have any make up on me!!! 
I don&apos;t think I will go back there 
I wish I had my money refund tho"
