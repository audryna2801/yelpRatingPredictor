5,"The Expert Gelson was cool. I went in to buy a fragrance and he was informative with all the different scents and was able to narrow down my choice. I would definitely see him again. The service was great.

Yes, they are open. Social distancing is being practiced. You might have to wait outside in line before you go inside."
5,"Closed at the moment because of Covid 19 and hopefully reopening at the end of June. The Forum Shops at Caesar&apos;s Palace are mostly luxury stores and fine eateries. There are a couple of candy stores and souvenir type places if one is interested in that. The Forum Shops are huge. You walk in through Caesars and have no idea how large the shopping area is until you start walking it.

Some of the luxury stores include Gucci, Burberry and Chanel. They have a great selection of items and you will find what you were looking for, albeit at full retail.

If that type of shopping is not in your budget the walk and window shopping is so much worth it. You can grab a light lunch or have a drink in a bar and just enjoy the area. It is beautiful. The service in all the stores is fantastic and Caesars Palace itself is beautiful. Enjoy."
5,"Beautiful, huge, and actually feels like your in the caesars palace mall! Haha they have many high end stores inside and lots of restaurants inside. It&apos;s honestly my favorite mall of the Vegas strip."
3,"If you&apos;ve explored your fair share of Vegas casinos and malls, you&apos;ll soon notice the same. names. everywhere. If you thought you saw a Gucci, Louis Vuitton, or H&amp;M store earlier in the day, you&apos;re not going crazy. There are multiple outlets of each brand here in Vegas, so much so that each major shopping destination is the same collection of stores at the core.

So the only thing that sets the Forum Shops apart is the Roman fountains and theme. The mall is run by Simon, which also operates hundreds of malls across the country. If anything, it&apos;s not worth making a special detour since you&apos;ll have to do precisely that to get here. It&apos;s a long walk from the Strip - you have to weave your way through the Caesars casino - and there is no back entrance/exit as a shortcut to adjoining properties. The ambience is dark and somewhat dimly lit, signage (especially for bathrooms) is infrequent and vague, and the main attractions (the fountains) are underwhelming after having made all the effort to get there. 

If you&apos;re staying at Caesars and are visiting Vegas from an area where such stores aren&apos;t abundant, then by all means do engage in some retail therapy here. Otherwise, there are the same shops everywhere else you go in Vegas - perhaps in the actual resort/casino that you&apos;re staying so that you don&apos;t have to lug your purchases around."
4,"The atmosphere was very clean, as expected and there were many high end stores and boutiques. The statues and atmosphere was as beautiful as I had envisioned. Unfortunately, I think as anywhere, they are taking a hit due to CoVid, as there were not as many people as I would think pre-CoVid."
5,"Elegant and glitzy... of course !!! Large variety of shops, you can see more sequins than you could imagine! There is everything- 
clothing- from crazy neon colors to sedate couture
Shoes - found a comfortable pair of walking shoes, essential if you don&apos;t want to wait in the Uber jammed lines
Art- so many paintings, imaginative photos, unique and expensive
Food- yum, sit down elegance, grab and go
Family Fun- sculpture, Fountains, action plays, movies- animations- daylight changing into dusk. Aquariums ( and watching them get cleaned by scuba divers was fun) 
Worth a stroll through the endless Everything! 
There are Info Kiosks with maps and Docents to help you Exit!!"
4,"If you like to shop very high end stores, this is the place to go!  Window shopping is fun, too.

The common areas that house the Forum Shops at Caesars is amazing.  Only the finest materials and it&apos;s just amazing to see the inlay marble, brass and the architecture.  

Our reason for going is to find our way to Joe&apos;s Crab Restaurant, which I review in a separate review.

Great place for people-watching, too!  A few too many strollers and kids running-a-muck, but still fun."
5,"The Forum Shops is an indoor mall located at Caesars Palace. The stores are mainly upscale clothing and accessories boutiques. 

Most were open when I was there a week ago. Their hours unfortunately seem to be limited."
4,"Fun stores, a lot of awesome brands - I had a blast shopping. Only downside is that I could not find a single store that would carry a 2XL shirt - my fiance has broad shoulders and we couldn&apos;t find him a decent shirt without taking a trip to the outlet mall."
3,"The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace are yet another place to shop for overpriced items. It doesn&apos;t have much you can&apos;t find in a regular mall. There&apos;s most of the typical stores. A few are kind of cheaper. The most though are middle to high end. 

It doesn&apos;t seem like there&apos;s much unique here. Most the shops can be found in big malls. There are some local Vegas themed ones. Save a lot of money by buying souvenirs in a convenience store instead of here. The fashion stores have the same clothes they do in other cities so no reason to buy them here unless you are in a hurry for something that night. 

It has a fountain show not quite as good as Bellagio. It doesn&apos;t cost you anything. That may be the best part about this."
5,"Omg this place is huge! They even have an upstairs and downstairs! 

So much shops &amp; food options! 

Cool decor and photo ops."
5,"The Gap staff,  Demetris and Paula,  are the best!!! They made our shopping experience so much fun! I recommend stopping in to say hi to the both of them if you are in the area! 

My guy and I needed the laugh after a long day of hearing people freak out over this coronavirus,  it&apos;s always good to put that out of your mind, and to laugh a little. 

These 2 made our day and gave us a great shopping experience. 

Hope to see both of you guys someday again! These 2 deserve a raise!!"
4,"This shopping area is very upscale and tony. It&apos;s not for the faint of wallet, like myself. Any major design house you can think of is housed here. LV, Gucci, All Saints, Burberry, Tory Burch, you name it and they have it. 
I enjoyed walking around and wallet wishing like most of the patrons there. It&apos;s certainly a reality check about how others live, or pretend to. There are some shops for the everyday mall shopper: GaP, APPLE, Lacoste, VS, Bath and Body, H&amp;M. 
There are plenty of places to eat and look around. Not many novelty shops, but overall a great place to look around."
4,"I really like The Forum Shops at Caesars! Even if you&apos;re not in the market to purchase anything specific, this is a fun spot to visit just to walk around and take in the sites. Like everything else at Caesars, the shops are extravagant and truly something to see. 

This shopping center boasts over 150 specialty stores, restaurants, and attractions. You&apos;ll find Chanel, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Louboutin, Gucci, Cartier, and other high-end (expensive) shops here; but, if you&apos;re looking for bargain shopping, this isn&apos;t the place to do it. They do have a few gift shops though, and I think there&apos;s an H&amp;M. 

The dining in this shopping center is more touristy as well. There&apos;s a Planet Hollywood and a Cheesecake Factory.

For walking around and taking in sites this is a great area, but for shopping (unless you&apos;re looking to drop a ton of money) and dining I think there&apos;s much better to be had elsewhere in Vegas."
3,"I remember when I looked forward to visiting the Forum Shops many years ago.  

I stopped in today and it just seems so dated now.  The place is a maze, and it&apos;s as if they just kept adding more wings to the mall without doing much updating to existing areas. I didn&apos;t find it inviting at all.

There are a number of higher end stores, with sales persons standing and waiting in empty businesses.

There&apos;s an Atlantis show every hour.  I saw a bunch of people waiting for the show to start, so I did the same.  I couldn&apos;t believe it when it started. It was a bunch of old robots from the 80&apos;s and you couldn&apos;t really understand what they were saying.  I mentioned it to the shuttle guy who picked me up and he even told me how lame it is.

I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to shop at the Forum with so many other choices available in hotels along the strip."
5,"I just love this place! I never get tired of going here bc it is peaceful strolling the forum even though it is filled with people. You are just awestruck each and every time of the beauty of the blue skies with clouds and the water fountains! 

Many higher end ships mixed with regular shops as well like H &amp; M, Apple store and Nike. Love that Nike store there bc it has such a great selection of the newest styles.

Even if you don&apos;t actually shop and buy something, it is really a travel destination in itself. Very beautiful and like you are walking the streets of Rome! They even have a beautiful art gallery! Love this place!"
5,"My favorite shopping area in Vegas. Want high end shopping? Want awesome restaurants? Art Gallery?  They have it all and they have long hours. All the staff is super friendly and are very welcoming to any questions. 

Tip- Uber/Lyft pickup is down stairs past Fendi."
1,"Walk to put our name on the list for two, wait was 20 minutes. We got a text that we are ready to be serve. Check in and seated at the very corner by the post. We looked around and there was 3 more groups  after us but they were seated by the booth and much better table. We requested if we can be move and they said we have to wait again for 20 minutes, they could have told us if we can wait and they will put our name to the next available table that would be more acceptable. We were told that we have to request for a better table.  It&apos;s our first time eating at this location but we&apos;ve been so many times at different location and never treated discriminated."
5,"The forum shops are done very well, all masqueraded within pretend roman inspired italian style streets with an ever changing sky, which changes colours to depict Dawn to dusk.  Plenty of stores and restaurants dotted around.  Makes for a very pleasant n fun atmosphere. Definitely worthy of a visit."
5,"As a time traveller, this place was pretty easy to blend in.  You know how sometimes you land in a place and your clothes look weird to some people and you stand out?  Well landing here is the best because people already look weird AND you have LOTS clothing options.  Also I always get dehydrated when I travel through the rips in time and they have a lot of drinks.  The fountain water is gross but it&apos;s free. 5 stars"
