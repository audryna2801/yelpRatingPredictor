3,"Based on my October 2020 visit. Harrah&apos;s is a vintage hotel that has recently gone through many updates. However, it&apos;s not my fav hotel under the Caesar&apos;s cap. That would be Planet Hollywood. Anyhoo, we stayed at Harrah&apos;s this time soooo here goes my short review. 

Hotel: Great location. Quaint compared to others on the strip. I hate they got rid of their coffee-shop-like diner that used to be on the first floor near the escalator to the monorail. The new eating situation is bananas, overpriced, and uncomfortable. Not a fan. Parking lot is behind the hotel and to the side. 

My Room: Very quaint. Comfy. I don&apos;t like how hotels are moved to a sliding door for the bathroom. This sliding door was shared with the closet. So if the closet was hidden, the bathroom was exposed. If the bathroom was hidden, the closet was exposed. BOOOOO! Reducing sound-privacy when sharing a room with ANYONE. The wall mirror near the window gave the illusion that the room was bigger than it was. The lights around the headboard of each bed was cute, stylish. 

I&apos;d rather not stay at Harrah&apos;s yet if I had to, I would not argue. I had very little to no interaction with the staff due to the pandemic. I&apos;m sure they were wonderful though."
5,"Have you ever had a lucky streak that you knew wouldn&apos;t end until you decided?

Years ago, I sat down on a double deck blackjack table with a minimum of $50...

Needless to say, I was third base on a table of three. 

I sat down and the two other players nodded as to acknowledge me and welcome me to the table.

Like all other times that I&apos;ve sat down at a table, I bought in with $300 in hopes of walking away with at least more than I came with lol.

Within a few hands I was already up $500! In fact the two other guys were up big too! They said they were glad that I had sat down and made sure I didn&apos;t go anywhere. 

Within 30 minutes, a new dealer came on as well as a change in decks of cards... it didn&apos;t effect the outcome. A few more hands of straight blackjack, no splitting or doubling down and I was now up almost $1500! My friend took $1000 from me to make sure I didn&apos;t play it and give it back. 

The two other players urged me to press my bet and stay longer... which I did. I stayed for another 8-10 hands I don&apos;t remember exactly how many but let&apos;s just say, we all left with a good chunk of change.  After tipping the dealer and cocktail waitress, I felt like I was Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic before the icebergs. 

Shaking due to the rush and excitement, I made my way to the cashier. 

It felt good cashing out and feeling like a winner.  This wasn&apos;t the first or last time I had won at Harrahs but it was probably the most significant for me as I didn&apos;t scream like I previously had done when I hit a straight flush on Four Card Poker lol.

It&apos;s been in awhile since I&apos;ve been and my Player Status has dropped significantly but I plan on making another trip soon. 

Win, lose or draw... gotta love the action! 

Vegas Baby!"
4,"We arrived by limo for a birthday destination vacation put on by girlfriend. She reserved us a room at The Linq, but due to Covid our reservations were transferred to Harrah&apos;s. I was fine with this, but it took me, calling the hotel twice, to find this out. Which was a slight detour and logistics change for the stretch limo that was picking us up from the airport and of course when the limo picks me up when I go to the airport.

When arriving, the three of us, were greeted by a security guard that pointed to a kiosk for check in. Had some hiccups with it and we looked around for a check in person who assisted us with upgrading our room to a suite that was on the 34th floor of the valley tower. The price was very good, we had to wait about 80 minutes for the room to be ready so we walking into the Linq promenade and got us some Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips.

When we returned to Harrahs, the check in person, recognized us and quickly got us our room cards. We went up to the 34th floor, found out very spacious suite, which I guess is some type of comp room that they only really give out to people who ball out or how some sort of importance in Las Vegas. Regardless it was nice. Nice wall couch, two big tvs, a pull out bed couch (which we didn&apos;t realized pulled out until the last night hahahaha) and two queen beds in a separate room. The bathroom was very nice with a stand in shower, a separate huge soaking tub and separate toilet area with two vanity sinks. Did a mention the huge glass table too? It was a nice surprise for a 4 day 3 night stay.

The view overlooked the mirage, treasure island, trump, venetian and the palazo. It was nice to see how little traffic went around Las Vegas BLVD. It is a huge contrast compared to pre-covid time.

Harrahs is beautifully located in that center action of Las Vegas BLVD, very good food and very fast food are located around this area. If you can, either doordash or head off-strip for bottles of alcohol. The liquor stores on the strip are about 2-5x more than the cost of off the strip for bottles. Harrahs has a nice boutique shop for bath bombs and soaps called Lola and its just like a Lush shop. 

Other than those experiences, you cannot go wrong with staying at Harrahs during this covid time."
5,"I get the pleasure of reviewing this from two different aspects: a guest who has stayed here prior (before I was a Yelper) &amp; currently back in town, popping in to visit &amp; gamble a little. And, after making my rounds through the other Strip joints- Harrah&apos;s left me feeling the most nostalgic, comfortable &amp; entirely accommodated.  It&apos;s safe to say I&apos;d call it my favorite &amp; preference. 

It isn&apos;t over the top, but it isn&apos;t at all lacking. I think they have the most to offer, and most of it at a very affordable price point for the average tourist looking for the commercialized Las Vegas Strip experience. It&apos;s very centrally &amp; conveniently located in the middle, almost, so the access to both directions is perfect- absolutely everything is within proximity. The tough part is making up your mind which direction you want to go, if you even make it past leaving the hotel because there is a LOT to check out inside, and a LOT of fun! 

Numb bar is my favorite. It&apos;s perfect to get that not too heavy drink, but something out of the norm &amp; fun you can indulge in for an hour or more. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s even better during the summer! But their flavors are great and you can also customize, slightly. Bonus is the cool cup to keep &amp; get discount refills on! They&apos;re decent quality, and the price point is also extremely good for specialty alcoholic beverages in novelty cups. And, it&apos;s slightly across from the piano bar, where they have the dueling piano performances, as well- always fun to watch/listen to! You can&apos;t help but stop and watch, even from the outside peering in. 

What&apos;s also extremely convenient is their small convenience store, next to the lobby &amp; Casio entrance. Pretty much all the basics &amp; alcohol, energy drinks &amp; water one needs, lol. Along with other goods, of course. I was also fascinated with the giant red CAKE vending machine hanging outside of the 24/7 pizza service! They weren&apos;t small slices. It was like 1/4 of an entire 6 layer cake for $9... any flavor! Mind. Blown. 

Restaurants are not a problem. There&apos;s more than 3, so it&apos;s tough to remember them all! Some are specific hours, others are 24/7. Entirely convenient, either way. From famous to modern &amp; casual- a little bit for everyone to pick from, almost. 

When I stayed here, the rooms were very nice and well kept. It isn&apos;t your most luxurious or upgraded- but you don&apos;t exactly come to the strip to stay in your room- it&apos;s literally perfect &amp; very affordable (considering the resort fee always tacked on) for a comfortable &amp; safe place to crash when you&apos;re ready to call it a day/night. The service is friendly &amp; they also take the current protocols seriously. All of the staff are following guidelines, and all of the guests I encountered were doing the same. 

Of course, there is a large casino area with everything to offer! A very big variety of literally everything. From slots to cards, table games, betting, high stakes, high rollers, video gaming &amp; even a few on the &apos;old school&apos; end- there is no shortage of finding your niche! And, the attendants are very attentive. It&apos;s a very clean &amp; maintained environment. They have a non-smoking section, specifically. Even without that perk- the ventilation system in this facility works so well it really doesn&apos;t smell like cigarettes at all, even in the vicinity of the patrons indulging. So, they definitely earn 5 stars for the cleanliness, maintenance &amp; protocols here. 

If I was vacationing &amp; staying on the Strip, I would definitely be choosing Harrah&apos;s! I was bummed I had to leave &amp; go back to my own hotel to prepare for work instead of taking the elevator up to my room &amp; looking forward to indulging again in the morning. Props to always making your guests feel welcome, even when they aren&apos;t staying there, and for always offering a great time in an awesome atmosphere to hang out- it&apos;s much appreciated how much is offered here."
1,"If you are looking for a location that&apos;s pet friendly, I suggest looking anywhere but Harrahs. The room we got was coated in dust, light was knocked crooked, and the shower literally wasn&apos;t cleaned from whenever the last person had stayed. Outside of that, we were told a $100 deposit and an estimation of $234.70.
Prior to checking out I double checked with an agent and they confirmed that would be the only charge. Fast forward to today, they took out $118 again as well as a $339.64 as a total. When I tried to call the lady gave me &quot;try again tomorrow I don&apos;t know&quot;. 
The room was left with no damage and I video taped over the whole room for proof so I know it wasn&apos;t due to damage.
Please save your breath and look for more reliable options !
I would of gave this place 0 stars if Yelp had let me."
4,"After a smooth checkin process, and one night&apos;s rest, I can easily give a review on the actual room I had. 

Breakdown of this place in a COVID-19 timeframe:

1. Join the player&apos;s club (their rewards program) to get really low nightly rates for a hotel on The Strip. You actually pay more for the resort fees than the actual room at times. 

2. This hotel is renovating and remodeling to give you a fresh hotel experience. For the price you pay, if you get a newer room, you will not be displeased.

3. The customer  service is noteworthy.  They seem to enjoy their job and are straight shooters about promotions, upgrades and whatnot. 

4. They no longer have their buffet. 


Try them out. I&apos;m certain you will not be disappointed when weighing amenities versus price point. Keep in mind my review is from the standpoint of someone that doesn&apos;t gamble, drink or smoke marijuana!"
1,"I don&apos;t feel safe here anymore . This property has gone down hill so fast it&apos;s mind blowing. The Property has not been well maintained so they claim this resort has 120$M upgrade.... Where? Oh you mean the rooms that you stripped ? They are awful but most importantly , I barely left my room after about 5 o&apos;clock

 I witnessed two men throwing punches near the elevator I witnessed four men  fighting outside over women ?  

Caesars entertainment pride themselves on safety and security let me just tell you right now I did not see any security at all.   This place is not safe anymore , if you don&apos;t want to get robbed , avoid this area ,, this part of the strip has become crime ridden extremely fast...

And safety? I was on the casino floor for more than an hour and did not see a single machine wiped down,, where are they Heath measures that are talked about on the website?

It&apos;s not safe anymore , cancelled the rest of my stay to get out of Vegas Proper... it&apos;s not safe here right now.

Caesars has really gone down hill , AVOID CAESARS PROPERTIES AT ALL COSTS!
Your safety and well being are more important, and they really don&apos;t care so you have to watch your own back ,, it&apos;s not how Vegas should be ...


THIS IS SAD!!! Caesars you really dropped the ball."
3,"Disappointed with the renovated rooms... I thought it was going to be better then what they had before... but somehow it wasn&apos;t great.

The room was super small. I don&apos;t remember it being so tiny? The closet was in the bathroom! Weird. Didn&apos;t even have its own closet. The beds at least were comfortable. No refrigerator in the room. The AC took a full day to actually work. The first night we were sweating bullets. It was hot, outside was over 110 degrees. After the first night the AC finally kicked in! The worst thing about the room... the shower. The shower was horribly designed. Even when nobody was in there and you just turned it on, the water leaked everywhere. There&apos;s no shower door so the water just goes everywhere. It was flooding and we had to use a couple towels to stop the water. 

The casino itself is good. I like their casino because it has cheaper tables and not too loud. The waitress comes around with drinks. It ain&apos;t cool though. It&apos;s very old, more of older crowd too.

Most of the sections in the parking lot was closed. Parking garage was old and super gross and dirty. Trash everywhere. I would not stay here if it wasn&apos;t for the location. It&apos;s smack in the middle of the strip! Plenty of other hotel options to gamble at too!"
4,"I was moved to Harrah&apos;s since the LINQ was closed during the week.  There is hand sanitizer everywhere and it&apos;s nice the parking garage is easily accessible from the hotel.  Check-in was fast since they have kiosks.  Also, for check-out you don&apos;t have to do anything except drop your key off when you leave.  

The rooms are upgraded and definitely did not disappoint.  The food hall is open and Starbucks as well.  Although, I recommend to go to the Starbucks outside near the LINQ instead since the line gets extremely long.  The location is prime since it&apos;s right in the middle of the strip."
4,"Review is during Covid restrictions-  

Affordable, clean fun hotel located in the heart of the strip. Always feels like coming home this is our preferred hotel. Rooms have been updated and are great for the price. Check in is easy either kiosk since COVID or some agents available. 
We are Diamond and usually have own check in but w/covid its all the same. 
They are taking temperature when checking in. 
Great food hall w/various food available from pastries, pizza, sandwiches, sushi and Mexican. 

Located right next door is a McDonald&apos;s, chipotle and Panda express if you&apos;re on a budget.  Right down is also a dennys for late night food and a Walgreens to stock up the room. Casino royale located next door is great for cheap drink specials when the bars reopen. 

We&apos;ve the karaoke when it qas going on always a fun time and look forward to them eventually bringing it back. 

They have a Buddy V pizza joint and the pizza is pricey BUT tasty sold by the slice. They also have a cake vending Machine. We tried it and surprisingly was moist and tasty. 

Love this place and will always be our go to."
1,"Don&apos;t recommend, filthy windows, pillows suck and are very thin, uncomfortable and had stains on them. vending machines were not very cold and never stocked. Kept having problems getting out of the parking garage because their key cards have trouble registering. I&apos;ve seen better won&apos;t be coming back"
1,Very poor customer service and the valet person was extremely rude. Shows one price on the app then triples the price when I tried to book it. I asked to speak to a manager but was told that though I have a fever and I&apos;m throwing up I need to come down to the front and infect everyone to extend my stay at this crappy place. There&apos;s plenty of other casinos and frankly of this one doesn&apos;t give a shit that I&apos;m a platinum member I can go to another one.
5,"This place is close to the center of the strip, the check in was pretty simple and easy on a kiosk and done. Room service wasn&apos;t needed but the gym was nice and cleaned often and limited. Towels and water available. 
Parking is all self serving right now so no valet but it was easy to drop bags or hold at desk. Open large rooms and bathroom."
4,"I recently stayed here and while it wasn&apos;t my first choice I couldn&apos;t pass up the $10 a night rates. I was a little worried because of less than stellar reviews but I wasn&apos;t going to let that deter me (people will never be satisfied). When I arrived I was glad to see that parking was free (no valet parking) and I didn&apos;t have a hard time finding a parking spot despite the place being pretty busy my whole trip.

The check-in experience was pretty simple and I loved you could do express no contact check in but be aware if you are checking in before 3:45pm you will get charged $10 for &quot;early check-in&quot;. I got a room in the 4th floor in the Valley Tower which features the newly remodeled rooms. I really liked the room, it was nice and clean, modern, the shower was amazing and it was better than I expected.

All of the restaurants and bars were open except for Toby Keith&apos;s. The hotel also had two Starbucks but I only noticed one was open for some odd reason. I only ate at PizzaCake which is Buddy V&apos;s (Cake Boss) pizza joint and it was really good but I&apos;ll have a separate review for that.

Now to the actual casino, I really liked that there were several hand sanitizing stations throughout the casino but wish they had disposable masks and hand washing stations like some of the other properties. Masks are not required here but all hotel/casino staff wear masks. I noticed that the table games did not have plexiglass but I guess that&apos;s not a big deal to some people. As for the slots only every other slot machine was being used in order to abide by the 6 foot rule so you&apos;re never sitting next to anyone. There were plenty of staff cleaning and disinfecting the slots as well. The slots were super tight as I&apos;d expected and they don&apos;t have some of my favorite slots.

Overall I really enjoyed my stay here and really liked the hotel. The location is great as it&apos;s right next to the Linq, Venetian and central to Caesar&apos;s, Bellagio, Bally&apos;s and etc. I will definitely be staying here again as long as they have those cheap rates!"
5,"Update nearly 5 years later and what a turn around this place has made! Newly upgraded rooms and lobby area. I checked in on 6/9/2020 and checked out today 6/12/2020. I first stayed in the Mountain tower which are the smaller rooms the front desk lady explained the rooms were small but I didn&apos;t realize how small until I got in the room, I decided Wednesday night I wanted to stay another night so I went downstairs and changed rooms to the Valley tower, and wow what a difference way bigger rooms! They are very spacious and clean, and lots of mirrors!

The pool is amazing they have two. One is a waiting pool it&apos;s only 10 inches deep but a perfect place to sit and get a tan with some water to keep you cool. It has this really nice rainfall shower you can stand under. The cocktail waitress was very nice as well and kept the drinks coming! Overall I had a great second time experience here! Thank you Harrah&apos;s for a wonderful time! I will be back"
4,"Clean, updated hotel. Clean rooms, nice hallways, the casino bathrooms were beautiful, clean and smelled good. The room was a good size. View was ok. Soft beds, 2 closets, no dresses, vanity and 2 chair table. Bathroom good size nice and clean. 

Only complaint and lost a star was no fridge"
5,Great stay for the weekend. Really good food choices and in the middle of everything! Will be staying again.
2,"I wanted to give this hotel 3 stars but it&apos;s more honestly &quot;I&apos;ve had better.&quot; We booked Harrah&apos;s for one night after we flew in late and were planning to make the long drive out to Grand Canyon next morning so just needed a place to crash. It&apos;s small and renovations aren&apos;t that impressive. I booked a deluxe king with city view. What I got was a view of the concrete walls. Really disappointing. (See photo)

No water pressure in the shower so good luck trying to clean your nooks and crannies. It&apos;s also a non adjustable rain head so it wasn&apos;t the easiest to work with and hot water kept running out. Who invented this half shower door nonsense? Well, the entire bathroom floor was flooded.

Resort fee gives you wifi for only first two connected devices. Pool was closed. And front desk tried to sell me a gondola ride with wax museum experience by saying it was a free promo but I&apos;d have to pay up front first and get a refund later. Uhhhhh no thanks.

Overall it&apos;s a decent budget hotel center strip but don&apos;t expect a whole lot and you won&apos;t be overly disappointed. Would not stay here again."
3,"So, I&apos;m only giving a 3 star review because Valet is weirdly closed Mon-Thurs. As well as the self check in process, is NOT smooth or easy. As well as I don&apos;t like surprises when checking in... manager initially seemed irritated, although she rectified the situation.

The manager Liaaa? Lena? I suck with names, but maybe Filipino or Hispanic? Definitely came to figure things out, and help the situation after a few bumps in the road. I did self check in, and early check in on the app. I get to the hotel, the kiosk isn&apos;t accepting information. I get to a receptionist, and it&apos;s not showing early check in and she tells me about a security deposit. 15 minutes later, the manager came and was able to waive the check in fee as well as the deposit. She gave me a room with a city view/strip view, on the 29th floor! Considering I suffer from anxiety, and rarely travel alone; her coming in and easing the process definitely helped and made me feel more relaxed. My room was clean, and I actually checked in right after they had cleaned my room. My bags were brought up, and so far so good!

As a card member with caesars; I didn&apos;t get any perks, no free play, no credit, nothing."
1,"I&apos;m a local, I stay on the strip a lot, it&apos;s just myself and my husband.  We stay for 1 night only when we do stay.  We have stayed here many times and we check in a little early.  Never had an issue.  Tried to do it this time they charged us $15 PLUS TAX to check in an hour early!! Don&apos;t they want business?  During COVID?  I mean are they fully booked?  No.. as a local, checking in an hour early and only staying one night AND paying the resort fee they have the audacity to be rude to me and charge me $15 plus tax to stay there 1 night, because we checked in at 3pm.  I will MAKE SURE all of our friends and family who visit will not stay here, and neither will we.  Never again."
