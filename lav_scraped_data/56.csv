5,"Mood - Something new to our Valley ( Covid19 Edition)

While everyone is still learning and working out the guidelines for essentials ect, construction has remained steadfast in our community. This new plaza is on the famous Spring Mountain Rd adding a plethora of new restaurants and retail experiences in a 33,000 sqft space.

Currently there are a few names on the Directory that are open right now, such as Saigon Baguette, and T- Swirl Crepe. The others that will continue to fill this plaza are on their way as the hiring process has taken a slower turn due to Covid.

We will continue to see more restaurants open as this plaza continues to thrive such as sushi places, a tea shop, Japanese tapas, and Cajun Style seafood just to name a few.

Would thoroughly recommend - pricing will depend on the establishments

Location is Spring Mountain/ Duneville - ample parking"
5,Love this plaza. Has the new good food spots in town and clean. From hot pot to crepes to the all you can eat seafood restaurant.
