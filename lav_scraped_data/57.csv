3,"I believe we&apos;ve now been the Palace Station twice over the past several years, but this last time was during the COVID-19 era.  

My first reaction is they didn&apos;t go as far as some of the other casino&apos;s in spreading out the slot machines to prevent strangers from sitting next to other, although the did remove about 1/2 the chairs.   People are still pulling chairs together and not putting them back, nor where the slot attendants moving them back, only pushing them in so people don&apos;t trip on them.  

Everyone was wearing a mask but there is nobody at the door checking people as they enter.   They also don&apos;t have anyone taking temperatures, but that&apos;s on par with almost all other casino&apos;s which seem to have stopped that practice.  

It&apos;s a little older casino so the ceilings are lower and machines are crammed into any corner possible.  It&apos;s kind of a maze so it&apos;s easy to get lost.    They had a lot of baccarat, both electronic and table games.   I did not see my favorite, High Card Flush.   

They had a good mix of new and older machines which I liked.  I didn&apos;t win much, but my Vegas partner in crime did OK so I would say the slot payout is on par with other Vegas casino&apos;s.  

The ladies at the players were club were very nice and helped us get replacement cards.   I&apos;m platinum level, but sadly the only promotions that day we were there were for the top two tiers.  

Still, we had a good time.  It wasn&apos;t very busy on Tuesday late morning/early afternoon so we were able to get enough play in to satisfy our craving for the day."
5,"Even during the pandemic, on a weeknight, there was a wait.  Parties were divided with plastic dividers and overall the staff was doing everything possible to keep us all safe.  The service was good and attentive, even when we had to return the oysters.  The oysters are not fresh and I don&apos;t recommend them here.  However, the pan roast at the spiciest level you can tolerate is worth it.  I ordered a level 9 and could tolerate it just fine.  For reference, I can handle hot food, level hot at Howlin rays for example.  If you love spicy you can err or the side of 10, you&apos;ll be fine! 

I wouldn&apos;t wait to wait 3 hours for the pan roast but for an hour wait, rotating the with friends and gambling in between, it&apos;s worth it for that delicious pan roast!"
3,"I haven&apos;t been in Palace Station since they did the remodel till last night .  I moved to Vegas in 92 and use to come here for the first few years to play Blackjack .  Of course that was before everyone went to the Shufflemasters , booo .  I use to do pretty well back then .  Anyway , honestly I liked the old Train Decor better .  The generic new style is just plain .  I guess I am just old school .  I played Bonus Video Poker 50 cent and it seems most are 7 / 5 machines , so if you know what I&apos;m talking about it give the house more edge than years ago .  

I played for about 3 hours in my mask which I know is mandated now , boo again .  Before I left , I had a $10 coupon for food and went to Little Tony&apos;s to get a meatball sandwich to go .  Well the coupon is dine in only , so I got a table and changed to spaghetti and meatballs .  They don&apos;t have sweet tea , so I had a Coke .  The noodles were a little to al dente for me , but it was fine .  It would have been nice if a piece of garlic bread was included .  Anyway , just a blaw night , no jackpot or exciting dinner .  I prefer going to Redrock Casino or the Palms , which was also remodeled but is closed at this time ."
5,"My apologies that my original post for Jim got lost.
Excellent bartender at the Casino bar.
Jim is very personable pleasant quick and makes you feel welcomed !
If you are every here at Palace Station be sure to check him out in swing shift; you won&apos;t be disappointed !

Also good AM shift Chad - just met him today he was extremely busy and could have used some help after 230p. He did his best as much as one person can do."
1,"First, I rarely leave negative reviews, however, I&apos;m making an exception for the Palace Station.

The primary reason for the 1-star review is cleanliness. The signage states the rooms are sanitized for guest comfort and safety, but my room was filthy and not even close to sanitized.

The light switches and countertops had visible finger prints, food particles, and dried spills. The chairs had dried food and other &quot;stuff&quot; on them. It appeared to me that the high-touch areas weren&apos;t sanitized so I doubt the rest of the room was either. Thank goodness I travel with Clorox wipes.

The establishment should be ashamed. Housekeeping obviously needs retrained and/or replaced. 

Additionally, I stayed on January 21st -23rd, and the front desk attendant was not rude but wasn&apos;t friendly. Further, the casino staff doesn&apos;t enforce the wearing of mask or distancing. Most of the staff looks like they&apos;re miserable at work instead of happy to have a job. Again, I personally believe retraining is necessary.

Based on this experience, I say since Vegas offers so many options you may be better off looking to them."
1,Security is so inconsistent. They will tell some people to put on masks but not others. Literally watching people in line at the oyster bar with no masks on and security is choosing who to enforce it with and who not to. Ridiculous. How is anyone supposed to take them seriously? They will throw out some people but not others.
1,"Came here with hubby because of the oyster bar. Waiting over an hour and of course we end up playing slots. It&apos;s a win and lost here and there. But of course, slots are tight but you risking your money for it. Anyway, this place is stingy with their drinks. I was looking for a Waitress and finally spotted one. I asked for a bottle water, damm waitress told me no. I&apos;m like wtf...I just lost some $$$ and I can&apos;t even get a bottle of water that prolly cost them 25 cents. This made me hella mad...I will not patron my gaming anymore. They don&apos;t treat their customers right. I rather be putting my money on gaming somewhere else."
5,"Over time I need to update my opinion about this casino. Free parking and more good restaurants than most other mediocre casinos off strip do. We love Boathouse, Tony&apos;s, bBd&apos;s, oyster bar...
We come here often mostly for the food. There&apos;s senior discount days which is funny but great if your man is one lol. There&apos;s Golden Knights giveaways several days a week! I no longer play bingo but I do like to still come here:)"
1,"Their Casino Host John is absolutely worthless, you have the best job in vegas johns d you can&apos;t even return calls...not to mention the property is a 3/4 out of 10 at best. 
About the only thing worth a crap is the oyster bar. It even that sucks as there is about 12 seats and a line at least a hour long almost all day and night."
5,"First time staying at an off the strip casino, and I must say, Ive been missing out. I think its always good to find new places to out at least every weekend,  but thats just me.

From the remodeled rooms, variety of dining (Salud Tacos are the bomb) Noodle Restaurant, Oyster bar, and sit down buffet, I was really impressed,  the customer service was also great. I loved how they checked up on me and my friend to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  

Only suggestion is they could use a better lounge, or bar with live music, however I will definetaly be coming back to this place."
3,"This casino smells like a cigarette ash try as soon as you walk in, and everywhere you turn. I loved the roulette slot machine I found while visiting. This machine was so much fun. However, as soon as I was getting comfortable playing the machine took a dump. My limited time here was cut super short. I had to call staff over to help me. They made several attempts to repair it but with no luck. They had to pretty much change an entire part on the machine and by the time they got it up and running again it was time for me to go home. But it looks pretty rundown and I wouldn&apos;t stay here. If you give it a go, there&apos;s a good sushi restaurant here that&apos;s what brought us in. Finally, the staff that assisted me had a great attitude during this entire ordeal. If I can&apos;t ever find a slot machine like this anywhere else I&apos;ll definitely come here. It was fun!"
4,"Off the strip, this hotel and casino is great. The night we arrived after eating delicious sushi, we stopped by Palace. Lower table bets and they seem to have some good slots that actually pay out. Masks required and temp check upon entering. Nothing too much to review on. All the hotels and casinos in LV during Covid are taking a lot of safety measures, which is great! One thing I wish I could review is Oyster Bar. My friends have eaten there numerous times raving about it! And it&apos;s open 24/7. That&apos;s the only place I&apos;ve seen during this trip that had a long line to get into. I guess it&apos;s THAT good. When you get a chance stop by Palace to check out something off the strip."
3,"they have been updating the palace station and from what I have seen, everything is shining and new, in fact I really wish they would re-brand the naming of the property, the inside has gotten so much more nice and the multi-million dollar renovation on the buffet speaks volumes as to how the casino is doing.  &quot;What&apos;s in a name?&quot; right?   Yes, that is very true. This property also has more than ample parking which and very nice event venue space, although i will admit I have yet to visit when they are hosting an event. The inside is very nice, the environment smell is cozy if not woody, mixed in with the scent of cigerettes, it reminds me of my Aunt&apos;s house. I really like the cleanliness of the bathrooms, A+ for whomever designed them, also an A+++ for whomever designed the Buffet and dining areas, you guys really hit the mark in good taste at an affordable price."
3,"Not the greatest casino in Las Vegas, yet not the worst. *shrugs*

It&apos;s suited far enough away from the strip to escape the noise and lights, but close enough to hop a cheap Lyft. The casino floor isn&apos;t bad, plenty of machines to play on. I&apos;m not sure how the table players would feel, though, as I didn&apos;t check them out much, and there didn&apos;t seem to be an overwhelming number. The rooms are, well... &quot;okay.&quot; Nothing to write home about. Our room was clean, and we had a nice big window to look out of (not the best view, but we didn&apos;t pay for one, lol). No refrigerator or microwave in ours, though. A decent place to go to just get away for the night. Would be awesome to see more customer retention offers!"
4,"I almost forgot to update my review for this establishment. Our recent visit to this hotel was a very good one. We had a warm welcome from  Daniella at the front desk upon arrival. Then I received assistance from Julianne at the front desk regarding the printing issues. The two Front Desk managers, Mara and Carlos, also made my business ran smoothly while I was there, due to their printing issue at the hotel&apos;s business center. I would like to thank these individuals for their assistance. Our room had a nice view of the mountain with a nice sunset in the background. Awesome! Other staff members were also good and helpful. Keep up the good work and thank you!"
5,"I really enjoy staying here at Palace Station:
1. Delicious buffet
2. Fun bingo
3. Loose slots
4. Nice rooms
5. Affordable rooms
6. Free shuttle to Fashion Mall
7. Plenty of games
8. Free parking


So far it&apos;s my favorite casino hotel off the strip."
2,"We decided to do a staycation at the palace station due to the special they had for the rooms for those who have the boarding pass. 

I checked in around 3pm that afternoon and asked for a upgrade for the 3 nights which was $20 per night! The guy that checked me in was awesome and very friendly! 
ended up going back home and waited for my wife to get off work so we could both go in the room together with our 2 year old son. 

1-Soon as we enter the door we have to go through the security line so we could get scanned in with the thermal imaging system *no biggie*. I walk down the ramp since we had luggage and was told to walk back UP the ramp and around to get in line even though there was no one there but us and I couldn&apos;t just bypass that and go to the front of the line. Once again no biggie.. so my wife stands with our just turned 2 years old son on the market they have for thermal imaging. The security guard informs us that he has to stand alone and can&apos;t move or we can&apos;t come in. I tell him he is 2 years old and he barely stands still for anything! We try to let him stand on the marker but he keeps wandering off of it and the fire keeps telling us he still cannot see because my son is moving. Ok, now I am getting frustrated. So we let 2 gentlemen who have been watching the whole thing behind us go ahead of us because this is going to be a task. They even commented on how the guard was acting towards us and making it ridiculous. So the 2 guys go ahead of us so I put my son back on the marker and hold his hand but I am a good distance away from him. So the guard looks at the computer for several seconds and says he can&apos;t see anything and I have to move away and my son just has to be alone (once again he says or we can&apos;t come in). At this point We are irritated and there are people standing behind us witnessing this and giving their 2 cents to the guard about the situation. So I just stand on the marker and go before my wife and kid so she can hopefully get him to stand on it by hisself since I couldn&apos;t. After a few tries he stands still after crying and throwing a fit! We finally get passed and the guard takes the mask and tries to give it to my son!! We have our mask on but a 2 year old is not going to keep his mask on, we have already tried! So we let the guard know once again how old he is and it&apos;s between the ages of 2-9 where they don&apos;t have to wear the mask. He said no and he needs a mask and pushes it in my wife&apos;s face!! Now I&apos;m angry and the people who were behind us gotten angry. My wife quickly said we live in Vegas and she works out here and knows the age limit due to her position. He sensed he was being overboard so he finally said ok and let us head up to our room. 

2-The room itself was a beautiful setup! Loved the decor in the suite!! Everything was lovely! Then we started noticing how dirty some stuff was but we were ok with it because we know that the hotel maids get rushed to complete a certain amount of rooms per day. Then we started noticing snot on the wall, a old chicken nugget my son picked up that was by the bed, stains on the bed sheet.

3- room service breakfast was FANTASTIC!! Except the undercooked sausage. We ate at the forks and spoon place I believe it&apos;s called and chicken parm was good. The 2 small pieces of chicken n mashed potatoes I waited 35 mins on for 14.99 was not. Waitress told me no one ever orders it. I should&apos;ve listened. The next day we ate at the Asian inspired bistro for happy hour. When I got it upstairs to my room and examined it, it tasted just how it looked... dry and thrown together. We ended up just throwing it away and going to FUKU burger.. 

4- the pool was AMAZING! Loved the chairs in the water! It wasn&apos;t cold but just right. The attentive of the waitress was great! 

In conclusion we were suppose to stay for 3 nights but left after the second because of hardly any food chooses inside the casino, as well as us just finding little not so clean things in the room. I did some gambling, everything seemeto be clean and security was enforcing everyone had a mask."
5,"Newly remodeled and easily located from the northern end of the strip, it is easily visible from the I15 interstate with a 6 story car park to the rear. The casino has a free bus to the north end of the strip during the day, takes 10-15 minutes which saves a taxi. The casino itself was pretty large, with decent flow, with plenty of slots on the floor. Had the lunch buffet which had good service by the staff, which rolled over into the evening buffet. It is worth getting the casino card which gives you benefits such as 2 meals for one. Within walking distance across the Sahara Ave, there are the usual chain restaurants etc such as Panera."
4,"Gambling off the Strip of Las Vegas...

My Uncle Terry Luke enjoyed this casino so much. He liked the poker game, &quot;Let It Ride&quot;, and other table games.  I always think of him and my cousin, Detective Kyle Luke, when I visit this casino. To Uncle Terry and Cousin Kyle - RIP and love always!

One year, I brought my sisters and mom here to dine at The Oyster Bar. We had the famous Pan Roast, some clam chowder, and a few fresh oysters.  It was a great experience!

I have happy family memories here... and also good times with friends.  Most recently, I brought my LA friends to get a Station Casino Player&apos;s card. We tried the Vegas Golden Knights promotion and just had fun...lol!

We will probably be back because of the free parking, convenient restrooms, and spacious environment!

P.S. There&apos;s also a Bingo Room!"
1,Covid 19 protocols not being enforced.  Why are they allowing guests to wear a clear face shield without a face mask?  What&apos;s the purpose?  Guests are wearing face masks on their chin while sitting next to each other at slot machines.
