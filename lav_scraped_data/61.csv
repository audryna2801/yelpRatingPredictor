5,"I would like to commend the Boyd group for following Covid restrictions. I accidentally walked in an exit. I was tracked down by a friendly security guard and was notified that I entered through an exit only door, he then got a thermostat to check my temperature. I appreciate that there are some businesses that are following Covid regulations strictly! The employee Michael in the gift shop was a pleasure as well!"
5,I always stay here for the Star Trek Las Vegas convention in July/Aug and a great hotel for the money. Very nice front desk and breakfast buffet in the mornings are a great way to start the day. I am writing this review in appreciation that they did an auto cancellation of my reservation for this year STLV which was moved recently due to Covid. I had forgotten about the reservation and Gold Coast cancelling my reservation and refunding my deposit saved me that deposit and possibly additional nights cost if they had not. Thank you!
4,"I don&apos;t have anything bad to say, just kinda neutral about the visit. It&apos;s a local hotel located off the strip. The price of table games and machines is typically cheaper than a casino on the strip. There&apos;s something about the decoration and ambiance in here that makes it feel dreary. It definitely seems smokier in here than other casinos.

Typically when I come here, it&apos;s to dine at Ping Pang Pong for dim sum."
5,"This is a casino for locals.  I think the reason for that is the slots are definitely looser than anywhere else.  They also have a lot of old school things like bingo.  Not fancy, no entertainment, but is a good place to go if you just want to gamble and actually win something!"
4,"PARTY OF 4: the only reason we came through this casino is to grub at the dimsum spot. 

It doesn&apos;t have the flair of all the newer casinos on the strip. If anything, it had an old-skool vibe soon as we walked through. Décor is dated, for sure, but it&apos;s clean. (Seriously, unlike those bigger and newer hotels, I found zero clutter ANYWHERE the whole time I was here.) Me likey! 

It was easy to locate the restaurant. We were seated and served immediately. 

We decided to walk around a bit - and ended up staying longer than originally planned. Their slot machines were paying out! (I honestly don&apos;t care if they take my money as long as they let me enjoy losing it! Those bonuses were AWESOME!) I came out a winner.

And another perk?! Valet parking is FREE even if I wasn&apos;t staying here. 

Great quick stop. I may just consider staying here next time..."
5,"Been going here for years for their great restaurant PING PANG PONG. Convenient off the strip location, comfortable room and good parking - all no complaints. Even got comp room nights through Boyd Gaming. Last time I stayed - the casino retired the 2 remaining Mr. Woo slot machines. There used to be 4, but only 2 were remaining last month. I was planning on returning in April but switched to The Orleans - because of Mr. Woo. Small little thing, right? 

It&apos;s now July - not going anywhere with lot&apos;s of people in a closed environment."
4,"I want to express my gratitude to Cindy, the slot hostess and Mr. Hernandez, the executive slot host at the Gold Coast. I received a comp offer to their Big Game Party Super Bowl Sunday but didn&apos;t respond fast enough so the party was full by the time I called. I could have used comps at Sam&apos;s Town or Suncoast and was actually planning to do so but being in Vegas and attending a Super Bowl Party in Sin City are 2 different experiences entirely. I decided to try again a week later and was connected with the host department to see if anything could be done. They were so nice and said they&apos;d be calling me back if they could make it happen. In less than 3 hours, I get a response saying the boss could get my buddy and I into the party so SCORE in the New Year. I&apos;m only a second tier member at the Boyd Casinos but I go to Vegas fairly often and appreciate the treatment I receive from their rewards program. 

The casino is a good size. Large enough to offer a decent selection of table games &amp; slots, but not so huge you need a GPS to get back to your  room when you&apos;re worn out at the end of the day. The rooms are kept up well but the casino is getting older so people expecting glitz &amp; strip opulence will be disappointed. If you just need a nice basic casino with decent odds, which you won&apos;t find on the strip, you should be happy here. Ping Pang Pong (yeah I know) is a great little Chinese restaurant with great Dim Sum early in the day. Noodle Exchange has a variety of Asian dishes priced reasonably. You know the food is good if there are actually Asians waiting in line. They don&apos;t mess with bootleg Panda Express kinda grub. There&apos;s a TGIF if you just want your basic bar &amp; grill menu. Also a huge bowling center upstairs. So if you want a nice casino to play and hang out, Gold Coast is pretty good choice. Get a players card. It&apos;s not that hard to get comps and the points are good at ANY  BOYD CASINO."
4,"Yet another nice older casino. The Gold Coast opened in 1986. It is located on Flamingo Road just off the Las Vegas Strip. It is owned by Boyd Gaming. I have never stayed here but I have gambled here many times since it&apos;s opening. It&apos;s across the street from the Palms resort. 

As a little bit of history it was the first casino to have a first run movie theatre in Las Vegas. The hotel has 711 rooms and a gaming floor of 87,000 square feet. I noticed that this casino has a bit of an older crowd and many locals from my conversations. 

The place is full of restaurants such as the Cornerstone, Ping Pang Pong, Noodle Exchange, Ports of Call Buffet and TGI Friday&apos;s for the major sit down restaurant. For quicker foods it has a Subway, Java Vegas Coffee and Bowling Snack Bar. 

Parking is easy, I always park behind the casino and the place is clean and nice, the people that work here are quite friendly. Years  ago it was a Suncoast Casino and I came here because I joined from Staying at the Orleans. It&apos;s a nice place. Low minimum bets, great drink prices and not as hectic as Strip casinos. Definitely a nice option. Room here are cheap and nice too, Lomé I said I never stayed here but I did check out a room and they are clean and decent, nothing extravagant but nice."
4,"Gambling in Las Vegas...

Gold Coast Casino is one of the properties belonging to the Boyd Gaming Corporation.

I like playing here because I get credit on my Boyd Players Card!  The credits add up and I move up from Ruby Level to Sapphire Level and get free parking at the California and Main Street Hotels! Haha!  I also can eat for free with my credits and even get 40 percent off on meals!

Located off the Strip, Gold Coast Casino is not in Downtown either.  It&apos;s on Flamingo Road - almost across from The Palms.  It has an Asian theme with a couple of Buddhas for good luck!  It has several dining choices, including Ping Pang Pong, a good Chinese restaurant. 

Gold Coast Casino is also one of the few casinos that have a bowling alley and a BINGO parlor!  Personally, I like the progressive video poker machines. Good luck!"
3,"This is one of several off-strip casinos that focuses on locals and other target clients. It is relatively spacious, well kept and comfortable to be in. It has a more relaxed atmosphere without much of the glitz and pomp of many of the strip casinos. 
It has several interesting amenities including a bowling alley on-site and therefor has some advantages if you have teenagers to keep entertained. The overall experience is good, but nothing special. You can avoid the stress of LV traffic here.
They have a decent buffet if you want to stay on the property during your stay, but again, nothing special. The price is good if you go on a special promotion."
1,"I was playing at the black Jack table for maybe 30 minutes and then a pit boss came to my table and called me by my full name and told me that I could not gamble here. I was caught of guard when he addressed me by my full name and I asked for the reason why and he told me &quot;I&apos;m sorry I just can&apos;t have you play here you need to leave&quot;. I didn&apos;t not feel like arguing so I just left but what was the reason? I wasn&apos;t being rowdy or overly excited and to be honest this was my first time ever even playing at a table. Im definitely spreading the word about this incident, I feel strongly discriminated against and strongly considering litigation"
4,Used to stay here in my younger days and it hasn&apos;t changed much.  Gold Coast is far more strict then many of the other casinos on the strip.  They have 1 entrance which has a temperature check upon entry.  Gift shot is reasonably priced and staff was friendly when I asked for directions.
5,"The prices of the rooms usually has me here... However on this March madness trip they were more expensive than a bigger suite across the street at the Rio .. no big deal.  
My group did watch games here on Thursday in the ballroom. It used to be packed with an amazing atmosphere... however the cost of a table pushed a lot of regulars away. We did watch a few games at the sister property The Orleans.... That was awesome..they have a great Set up out there!!!! 
It was nice to watch games in a smoke free atmosphere so there&apos;s that. I hope they get the regulars back for March madness.
I like the food options here ...tables games were budget friendly for my financial situation.. all in all it was fun.. I hope they spend my money I donated wisely.
 (5 stars from me)

3,"Free is a very good price however, sometimes you get what you pay for and in this case we definitely did. If you are in the mood for mushy carrots, stuffing that resembles glue, the oddest tasting prime rib (likely frozen then thawed), vegetables that appear mushy you should definitely eat in the buffet.  I am by no means a buffet connoisseur but, this was THE most disgusting food I&apos;ve seen in a long time (check my review of Carlino&apos;s in Wood Village OR).  We did get our money back though I&apos;m not sure if we will get our taste buds back.

Let&apos;s talk about the rooms they&apos;re actually quite nice and very clean, the beds are fairly comfortable and there&apos;s a really nice sized TV. Don&apos;t expect extra blankets or towels those will be there, nor will a folio with information about the hotel and the surrounding area.  If you&apos;re lucky, like we were, you will have a housekeeping person bang on your door at 8:30 AM asking if you have left yet at which point you will roll your eyes and let her know that - no you haven&apos;t.

Parking is free so that is a plus"
1,"This place is not people friendly, all their security so much annoying come up to me 10 times while I&apos;m playing slot machine. I&apos;m all alone not bothering anybody and 6 different security came up to me. I think they haters , racist people because I&apos;m winning and foreigner. If only palms casino open I just go there"
4,"Finally got a chance to check out the hotel, pool area and bowling center on a recent visit. My last trip was in 2004, and it looks like they&apos;ve done an awesome job with the upkeep over the years.

My original reservation was for a two double bed premium room, although I was given a king upon checking in, as I had an extremely late arrival. No big deal as the person that was going with me had something come up and couldn&apos;t make it, but the overall size of the room seemed a bit small. Two people might be a crowd.

A sliding door to the bathroom, lots of drawers, an integrated phone with USB/smartphone ports, and a wall unit AC/heater were some additional features of the room.

The pool and hot tub were awesome. Very clean, well maintained, lots of towels and loungers available.

Being an avid bowler, it was great having a 70 lane center right on the second floor - see separate review.  Definitely the biggest I&apos;ve been in to date.

The gaming was great, for what little play time I put in. Lots of newer machines as well as classic reels. I witnessed several people hitting big jackpots, so it appears people actually win here. I was walking past the high limit room and saw someone being photographed holding a huge cardboard check. Two hours later, I saw the photo on the Gold Coast Facebook page, and it turns out the local resident had just won $40,000 playing video poker!

Tried the buffet for breakfast. Super cheap with a players card, great variety.  The not so good snack bar I encountered last visit was gone, and there was a good selection for dining, including Subway and a 24 hour TGI Friday&apos;s in addition to the Asian restaurants and steakhouse.

Only downers other than room size were that the property was a bit smoky, but that&apos;s to be expected in Vegas. While fast food, convenience stores, and Chinatown were all within walking distance, the immediate area lacks a full bore supermarket or a Walmart.

Definitely worth a visit.

TIP: Avoid the new Walgreens that just opened up across the street. Price gouging central and the most expensive I&apos;ve ever been in."
4,"My trips to Vegas are varied and usually have me staying at Caesar&apos;s, Aria, Harrah&apos;s, Red Rock the M or some other Boutique hotel. 
Not this time, so when a friend invited me to join her for a quick get away I said sure - no( well not too many) questions asked.

Which is how I wound up here at the Gold Coast and it was fine. Actually it was better than fine. With an average room rate of about $60 with fees and taxes, it turned out to be a good decision.

The staff were generally pleasant, the room was clean and comfortable and the location was a very convenient $8.00 uber ride to the Bellagio. This is important, because a trip to Vegas without a tour of the garden at the Bellagio is a mistake.

Any way, back to the Gold Coast... 
The casino seems to cater to an Asian Clientele... the bad is the &quot;no smoking&quot;  rules seem to get challenged quite a bit.
The good is the dim sum at their restaurant Ping, Pang, Pong which was excellent! 
The hargow, bao and other usual dishes from the carts were outstanding. I could go back tomorrow!
The women serving from the carts were pleasant and helpful.

The Sunday brunch is a good value for the price of $19, after taxes.
The omelette and bottomless champagne offerings are quite good. The gelato was delicious. I recommend passing on the steak or the calamari- both too tough and to beware of the chocolate fountain. This last thing is not the fault of the hotel, rather some of the customers when we were there were a little rough and were taken to licking their ice cream cones and then sticking them back in the fountain between bites.... what are  you going to do?  stand a guard there with a fly swatter? 

Any way being conservative on the $ for hotel room made the tickets to Rod Stewart at Caesar&apos;s a sweet deal. This is how we can &quot;stay forever young&quot;...and not broke!"
4,"At the Port of Call. $16.99 PrimeRib Buffet. The PR Caps can be to 4 stars. Bread sticks 4 stars. Pork Ribs with sauces thicken on top 4 stars.
Taco&apos;s with Super Hot Salsa 4 stars. Ice Cream/Gelato is soft though @ energy saving??? If cold cold gelato is important for you go to Red Rock Casino, Sun Coast Casino, Sante Fe Casino."
1,This is absolutely the worst place in all of Las Vegas when it comes to service their waitresses are nonexistent. There is no such thing as floor staff for security or management floor anything it is an absolute joke
1,"Roaches/beetles in the bed and on the floor of the hotel room.

Had the worst hotel experience of my life. At 1:30 AM, we found a cockroach or beetle looking bug on the bed. As we rushed to call the front desk, we saw more, a total of 5 in the bedroom! Extremely gross and unsanitary to say the least.

It took roughly 30 minutes before anyone came up. There was never an apology or any sort of surprise something like this had happened. Based on their reaction, it seemed like a normal occurrence for them. They offered another room in the hotel, but no assurances that this was an uncommon thing. After telling them we would be leaving, they simply said they weren&apos;t sure we could get a refund because it was booked through Expedia. Didn&apos;t care, just wanted out of that dirty place. So it was left up to us to find a new hotel at 2 AM.

This was a week ago, and I haven&apos;t heard anything back from customer service or management. They simply do not care. Do not stay here, the place is crawling with bugs! I don&apos;t see an option to post pictures here, but I&apos;ll add them somewhere on this Yelp page."
