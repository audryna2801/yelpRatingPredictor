5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago.

4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!

Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
5,"love it

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each).

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,"Came here for New years eve, &amp; sat outside in their closed patio. We didn&apos;t feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good &amp; food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria &amp; that is delicious. I&apos;m obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well &amp; delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."

5,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I&apos;ve had outside of the &quot;homeland&quot;!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. 

The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! 

If you&apos;re in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around.

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn&apos;t too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you&apos;ve ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I&apos;m just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
4,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it&apos;s always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
