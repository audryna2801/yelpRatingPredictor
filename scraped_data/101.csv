5,"Absolutely delicious brunch. Large portions. Got the croissant sandwich, deconstructed lobster roll, churro french toast and berry lemon pancakes. Every dish was flavorful. Highly recommend. 

Got pickup due to covid. Ordered online and was ready within 20 minutes."
5,Got takeout. It was amazing !!! Not one item I didnt love. And we couldn&apos;t eat it all!
3,"This place was good and good service, but I think my expectations were too high. They have a fun menu but the taste of the dishes themselves was average. For drinks, the coffee was good (just basic drip coffee), as was the chai tea latte. The chai latte was more milky and less spicy than I prefer, but still good. As for dishes, the best was the Apple and Pear Crumble French Toast- very flavorful toppings and fluffy french toast. We also tried the banana praline pancakes which had good flavors but not enough crunch. It almost tasted a bit mushy with all the sauce on it. Lastly, the lobster roll Benedict was tasty but came out cold. I think I would have liked this dish more if the lobster used was more plain (it tasted like tuna salad but with lobster). Overall good place if you&apos;re looking for brunch or breakfast nearby, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of your way to come here."
5,"I love Bongo Room! Such a fun, eclectic brunch spot. I love how fast they change menu&apos;s and incorporate seasonal faire. Out of the many times I&apos;ve eaten here my most favorite meals of all time where Strawberry Banana Pancakes and Red Velvet Cream Cheese Pancakes! Last I checked these menu items are not available ATM but could make a come back! I hope so because everyone deserves to try the SB ones. So yummy and sweet! It&apos;s like eating dessert for breakfast."
4,"Very high quality breakfast options with rich and flavorful options to choose from. I enjoyed the open and airy ambience that was able to accommodate large groups. 

I tried the BLT Benedict and was pleasantly surprised. It had a very nice sauce that complimented the egg yolk and kept the English muffin from leaving the plate too dry. I also appreciated that the portion size was large enough to satisfy my hunger.

One thing I will say I did not like was the space between the booths. I consider myself average size and the booths were so tight to the table I felt a little claustrophobic. I like to feel comfortable when eating, and I had to seriously concentrate to allow that to not center my attention while dining."
4,"Nice cafe, no words. But a lily bit pricey. They offer traditional breakfast options. Tasty omelette, home fries, but a bit crispy. The staff is very attentive. I never saw my glass empty;)"
5,"Bingo room you have my heart. I go here quite often, especially when things are actually open and you can sit down. This is by far my favorite breakfast place ever. My all time favorite is the strawberries and cream French toast. My second favorite- the pretzel pancakes. Yum. Grab a side of bacon and an iced tea and there you have the best breakfast ever. Service here is always pretty fast and I always leave enjoying my meal. I have taken to go as well and pancakes were hot, warm, and just as tasty. I highly recommend."
3,"The food was pretty good, my friend particularly loved her white chocolate pancakes. The restaurant was very busy and told us we could not be seated unless our whole party was ready. One of my friends has a gluten allergy and the server failed to communicate to the chef that the bread from his order should come on a separate plate--however they did remake it at no cost. 

We had a friend who was very late and arrived after we had already started eating. We asked if we could order her food, or food to go. They replied that they do not do to-go food on weekends and that they don&apos;t allow any orders after the first one has been made (Assumedly to stop people from taking too long at a table and keep things moving). They also told us she wouldn&apos;t be allowed to join our table to sit with us while we finished up and that she had to wait outside/in the waiting area.

Some notes:
Wait time was nonexistent at 9 am, it got busy quickly though. The waiting area was very small--just the vestibule with a heat lamp. Booths seated 6. Staff were friendly and polite. Although I wasn&apos;t a fan of the restaurants policies and they gave us a bad experience, I understand why they have them I&apos;m general."
5,"I love the bongo rooms pancakes! So do my children and ALL of my girlfriends. If you want a healthy option the Tomatillo salsa scramble is my go to and it&apos;s delicious. My husband liked the chorizo, potato and avocado omelette. He just reminded me that he actually likes everything at the bongo room so you can order anything and you will probably love it. Every pancake/French toast is yummy and unique in its own way. We typically order four or five different options then share family style with our kids. We have three children so seating is typically finagled but it always works out and they find us a table for five. The wait seems extra short due to all the fun shops in the area and the service is always prompt once seated."
4,"I feel like the only thing I need to say is that they serve Deconstructed. Lobster Roll. Eggs Benedict. Say it with me! 

This excited me because I&apos;m not used to seeing this type of benedict on any menu, so I took a chance. For $15.95. And it literally is a deconstructed lobster roll with poached eggs and hollandaise. The lobster meat was plentiful, the roll was nicely buttered and soft. The eggs and the hollandaise were just an added bonus. 

Let&apos;s also talk about the potatoes - they were cooked to perfection. Usually I have trouble finishing a side of potatoes because they can get so heavy. But the portion was excellent, and the consistency helped with consumption! Not too starchy. 

A wait is to be expected. According to my cousins, the Bongo Room is pretty popular in these parts. If you&apos;re visiting from out of town and want to try this for a weekend brunch, I suggest you plan your trip a bit early to account for waiting!"
5,"Food was yummy in the tummy.  The wait is long to get a table, but hey, it&apos;s a small space. 

It is noisy and there are loads of people here for breakfast and brunch on the weekends.

Facility is clean, servers are friendly.

The door and entry is not super ADA friendly.

The food was plentiful, flavorful, and rich.  Expect a heavy meal, not light."
5,"come hungry and ready to wait. on a sunday morning around 1030, youre looking at a good hour. leave your name and hit up a bar down the block while you wait. however, let me tell you - its worth every minute. the place is small and crammed, but the staff is great and the service is fast!

the irish coffee hit the spot and grew some hair on my chest. i gulped it down in 2 gulps. priced a bit high, but worth it since it woke me up and got me a nice buzz all in 1.

the lobster roll eggs benedict is a must get. its deconstructed, but a full on mess. the potatoes it comes with are delish too. its filling, and you will eat every last bite off the plate. as simple as it is, hollanidaise sauce its constantly messed up. not here, the bongo room nails their perfect hollaindaise sauce. they had a generous hand with the lobster meat too. 

the chocolate tower of french toast would be the next dish i order if i come back. i grabbed a few bites of my friends and fell in love instantly. its not overpowering with sweetness, and the chocolate is real chocolate!"
4,"Up until this last weekend, I was sole Chicagoan left who had not yet been to The Bongo Room. With three locations including one within walking distance of me, I had no excuse left not to give them a try!

When you go to Bongo Room, always expect a wait. We were quoted about 30 minutes so checked in, then grabbed some coffees next door. There are a million fab coffee shops right next to the Wicker Park location so waiting a few minutes is no problem at all.

We were seated at the counter and Jessica took care of us. She was so bubbly &amp; friendly for a Saturday morning! Perfect amount of service to check in on us but also leave us to our chatting. 

I had the BLT Pesto Benedict which was a unique offering and huge portion with a mountain of breakfast potatoes on the side. Loved this $15 dish and would def get it again. My friend had the Cinnamon Pear French Toast which I tried and whoa, was it indulgent and savory but very sweet &amp; tasty.

All in all, wonderful brunch at The Bongo Room and I&apos;d definitely pop in again for some eats."
4,"I went here on a Sunday morning after a weekend in Chicago. We had a party of 11 so we had to split between two tables. The place is fairly small so if you have a big group I would no recommend it. This is nothing against the food though, it was delicious! I got a caprese eggs Benedict with sweet Italian sausage. It was very good and I liked that it was on an English muffin. The potatoes were also good. My only complaint was that there was too much hollandaise sauce. Next time I would just ask for less. Overall I recommend this breakfast spot!"
4,"So far only tried the white chocolate caramel pancakes which were super tasty! I did a call in order so they were settled a bit and I had to heat them up when I made it home. Good topping, good portion, good flavor. Almost $15 after tax for just pancakes though which is a little much especially since you can&apos;t make them a platter but still enjoyed them."
3,"Fun restaurant, definitely need a reservation for brunch, decent food and prices.

I wanted to try a cute, brunch place in Wicker Park and Bongo Room kept showing up. We made a reservation, and thank goodness for that since it was a full house Saturday day. We got seated and I immediate was drawn to their pancakes. They no longer have the red velvet pancakes featured in the yelp photo. I got their pumpkin spice pancakes. Their cakes don&apos;t seem to be recommended with syrup since they come with sauces and creams of their own that the restaurant recommends. I also got a turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Both entrees had a lot of potential but had less flavor than I wanted them to. The server was delightful and the bill didn&apos;t make us cry so I&apos;m writing it off as a good experience but I will continue the hunt for cute, brunch spots."
4,"I had been to a different location Bongo Room in the past and decided to try this one during a visit to Chicago. We went shortly after opening on a Saturday morning so there where still plenty of open tables.

The menu is not too big, with a side dedicated to brunch (Saturdays and Sundays only). We ordered two savory dishes and one individual strawberry and banana pancakes (yes, you can order pancakes individually, though it does not explicitly say so on the menu).

I enjoyed my food, though wish the lobster benedict overall was more hot (temperature-wise). I also bit into a few fragments of lobster shell which was not so fun. The pancake was good but a bit dry and thick.

The interior is nice with an industrial feel. Service was probably the highlight of the meal, with a friendly host and server and waters brought to your table almost immediately after being seated.

Prices are fair and basically what I expected for brunch.

Overall, a solid meal though not quite as memorable as my previous visit.

P.S. The sink in the restroom is really unique, it has the hand dryer integrated into the faucet!"
2,"I had been wanting to come here for a couple years now, unfortunately just to be disappointed. When we arrived the hostess sat us at a very noticeably dirty table. I assumed she would ask someone to come clean it but she didn&apos;t. The guy that brought over our water and utensils moved us to a different table after noticing how dirty it was. I ordered a breakfast burrito which was supposed to be in a spinach tortilla but it wasn&apos;t, it came in a regular flour tortilla. It wouldn&apos;t have been a big deal if someone would&apos;ve just gave me a heads up but no one said anything. I guess they were hoping I didn&apos;t notice? The flavor was mediocre, definitely nothing to brag about. My son ordered eggs, bacon, house potatoes, and an English muffin. He wasn&apos;t impressed either. I paid $40 for brunch neither one of us particularly enjoyed."
4,"When picture of food from this place on Yelp, from their savory looking dishes to the foods sweet and scrumptiously looking, sugar filled French toast, I knew I had to stop by!

I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was nothing special. I wouldn&apos;t order it again just cause it didn&apos;t leave an impression on be. Also a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little (or a lot) of hot sauce couldn&apos;t fix.

The chocolate tower French toast was absolutely perfect. Very rich and chocolatey but not too sweet.

The service was a little on the slow side. Our glasses were only filled once and it took a lot of effort to get the waiters attention so I had to knock off one star. Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!"
5,I love this place. Might be my new favorite brunch spot. I had the lobster roll Benedict and the chocolate tower French toast. It was mouth watering and very filling. The French toast was very heavy and it&apos;s a big portion so I would recommend sharing it. The best time to go is at 9am right when they open otherwise you&apos;re going to be waiting for a long time but it&apos;s definitely worth the wait. They do not have flavored creamers for the coffee which I would suggest for them to offer. Parking is also tricky in this area but I can&apos;t wait to come back to try more off the menu!

the irish coffee hit the spot and grew some hair on my chest. i gulped it down in 2 gulps. priced a bit high, but worth it since it woke me up and got me a nice buzz all in 1.

the lobster roll eggs benedict is a must get. its deconstructed, but a full on mess. the potatoes it comes with are delish too. its filling, and you will eat every last bite off the plate. as simple as it is, hollanidaise sauce its constantly messed up. not here, the bongo room nails their perfect hollaindaise sauce. they had a generous hand with the lobster meat too. 

the chocolate tower of french toast would be the next dish i order if i come back. i grabbed a few bites of my friends and fell in love instantly. its not overpowering with sweetness, and the chocolate is real chocolate!"
4,"Up until this last weekend, I was sole Chicagoan left who had not yet been to The Bongo Room. With three locations including one within walking distance of me, I had no excuse left not to give them a try!

When you go to Bongo Room, always expect a wait. We were quoted about 30 minutes so checked in, then grabbed some coffees next door. There are a million fab coffee shops right next to the Wicker Park location so waiting a few minutes is no problem at all.

We were seated at the counter and Jessica took care of us. She was so bubbly &amp; friendly for a Saturday morning! Perfect amount of service to check in on us but also leave us to our chatting. 

I had the BLT Pesto Benedict which was a unique offering and huge portion with a mountain of breakfast potatoes on the side. Loved this $15 dish and would def get it again. My friend had the Cinnamon Pear French Toast which I tried and whoa, was it indulgent and savory but very sweet &amp; tasty.

All in all, wonderful brunch at The Bongo Room and I&apos;d definitely pop in again for some eats."
4,"I went here on a Sunday morning after a weekend in Chicago. We had a party of 11 so we had to split between two tables. The place is fairly small so if you have a big group I would no recommend it. This is nothing against the food though, it was delicious! I got a caprese eggs Benedict with sweet Italian sausage. It was very good and I liked that it was on an English muffin. The potatoes were also good. My only complaint was that there was too much hollandaise sauce. Next time I would just ask for less. Overall I recommend this breakfast spot!"
4,"So far only tried the white chocolate caramel pancakes which were super tasty! I did a call in order so they were settled a bit and I had to heat them up when I made it home. Good topping, good portion, good flavor. Almost $15 after tax for just pancakes though which is a little much especially since you can&apos;t make them a platter but still enjoyed them."
3,"Fun restaurant, definitely need a reservation for brunch, decent food and prices.

I wanted to try a cute, brunch place in Wicker Park and Bongo Room kept showing up. We made a reservation, and thank goodness for that since it was a full house Saturday day. We got seated and I immediate was drawn to their pancakes. They no longer have the red velvet pancakes featured in the yelp photo. I got their pumpkin spice pancakes. Their cakes don&apos;t seem to be recommended with syrup since they come with sauces and creams of their own that the restaurant recommends. I also got a turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Both entrees had a lot of potential but had less flavor than I wanted them to. The server was delightful and the bill didn&apos;t make us cry so I&apos;m writing it off as a good experience but I will continue the hunt for cute, brunch spots."
4,"I had been to a different location Bongo Room in the past and decided to try this one during a visit to Chicago. We went shortly after opening on a Saturday morning so there where still plenty of open tables.

The menu is not too big, with a side dedicated to brunch (Saturdays and Sundays only). We ordered two savory dishes and one individual strawberry and banana pancakes (yes, you can order pancakes individually, though it does not explicitly say so on the menu).

I enjoyed my food, though wish the lobster benedict overall was more hot (temperature-wise). I also bit into a few fragments of lobster shell which was not so fun. The pancake was good but a bit dry and thick.

The interior is nice with an industrial feel. Service was probably the highlight of the meal, with a friendly host and server and waters brought to your table almost immediately after being seated.

Prices are fair and basically what I expected for brunch.

Overall, a solid meal though not quite as memorable as my previous visit.

P.S. The sink in the restroom is really unique, it has the hand dryer integrated into the faucet!"
2,"I had been wanting to come here for a couple years now, unfortunately just to be disappointed. When we arrived the hostess sat us at a very noticeably dirty table. I assumed she would ask someone to come clean it but she didn&apos;t. The guy that brought over our water and utensils moved us to a different table after noticing how dirty it was. I ordered a breakfast burrito which was supposed to be in a spinach tortilla but it wasn&apos;t, it came in a regular flour tortilla. It wouldn&apos;t have been a big deal if someone would&apos;ve just gave me a heads up but no one said anything. I guess they were hoping I didn&apos;t notice? The flavor was mediocre, definitely nothing to brag about. My son ordered eggs, bacon, house potatoes, and an English muffin. He wasn&apos;t impressed either. I paid $40 for brunch neither one of us particularly enjoyed."
4,"When picture of food from this place on Yelp, from their savory looking dishes to the foods sweet and scrumptiously looking, sugar filled French toast, I knew I had to stop by!

I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was nothing special. I wouldn&apos;t order it again just cause it didn&apos;t leave an impression on be. Also a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little (or a lot) of hot sauce couldn&apos;t fix.

The chocolate tower French toast was absolutely perfect. Very rich and chocolatey but not too sweet.

The service was a little on the slow side. Our glasses were only filled once and it took a lot of effort to get the waiters attention so I had to knock off one star. Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!"
5,I love this place. Might be my new favorite brunch spot. I had the lobster roll Benedict and the chocolate tower French toast. It was mouth watering and very filling. The French toast was very heavy and it&apos;s a big portion so I would recommend sharing it. The best time to go is at 9am right when they open otherwise you&apos;re going to be waiting for a long time but it&apos;s definitely worth the wait. They do not have flavored creamers for the coffee which I would suggest for them to offer. Parking is also tricky in this area but I can&apos;t wait to come back to try more off the menu!
5,"Absolutely delicious brunch. Large portions. Got the croissant sandwich, deconstructed lobster roll, churro french toast and berry lemon pancakes. Every dish was flavorful. Highly recommend. 

Got pickup due to covid. Ordered online and was ready within 20 minutes."
5,Got takeout. It was amazing !!! Not one item I didnt love. And we couldn&apos;t eat it all!
3,"This place was good and good service, but I think my expectations were too high. They have a fun menu but the taste of the dishes themselves was average. For drinks, the coffee was good (just basic drip coffee), as was the chai tea latte. The chai latte was more milky and less spicy than I prefer, but still good. As for dishes, the best was the Apple and Pear Crumble French Toast- very flavorful toppings and fluffy french toast. We also tried the banana praline pancakes which had good flavors but not enough crunch. It almost tasted a bit mushy with all the sauce on it. Lastly, the lobster roll Benedict was tasty but came out cold. I think I would have liked this dish more if the lobster used was more plain (it tasted like tuna salad but with lobster). Overall good place if you&apos;re looking for brunch or breakfast nearby, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of your way to come here."
5,"I love Bongo Room! Such a fun, eclectic brunch spot. I love how fast they change menu&apos;s and incorporate seasonal faire. Out of the many times I&apos;ve eaten here my most favorite meals of all time where Strawberry Banana Pancakes and Red Velvet Cream Cheese Pancakes! Last I checked these menu items are not available ATM but could make a come back! I hope so because everyone deserves to try the SB ones. So yummy and sweet! It&apos;s like eating dessert for breakfast."
4,"Very high quality breakfast options with rich and flavorful options to choose from. I enjoyed the open and airy ambience that was able to accommodate large groups. 

I tried the BLT Benedict and was pleasantly surprised. It had a very nice sauce that complimented the egg yolk and kept the English muffin from leaving the plate too dry. I also appreciated that the portion size was large enough to satisfy my hunger.

One thing I will say I did not like was the space between the booths. I consider myself average size and the booths were so tight to the table I felt a little claustrophobic. I like to feel comfortable when eating, and I had to seriously concentrate to allow that to not center my attention while dining."
4,"Nice cafe, no words. But a lily bit pricey. They offer traditional breakfast options. Tasty omelette, home fries, but a bit crispy. The staff is very attentive. I never saw my glass empty;)"
5,"Bingo room you have my heart. I go here quite often, especially when things are actually open and you can sit down. This is by far my favorite breakfast place ever. My all time favorite is the strawberries and cream French toast. My second favorite- the pretzel pancakes. Yum. Grab a side of bacon and an iced tea and there you have the best breakfast ever. Service here is always pretty fast and I always leave enjoying my meal. I have taken to go as well and pancakes were hot, warm, and just as tasty. I highly recommend."
3,"The food was pretty good, my friend particularly loved her white chocolate pancakes. The restaurant was very busy and told us we could not be seated unless our whole party was ready. One of my friends has a gluten allergy and the server failed to communicate to the chef that the bread from his order should come on a separate plate--however they did remake it at no cost. 

We had a friend who was very late and arrived after we had already started eating. We asked if we could order her food, or food to go. They replied that they do not do to-go food on weekends and that they don&apos;t allow any orders after the first one has been made (Assumedly to stop people from taking too long at a table and keep things moving). They also told us she wouldn&apos;t be allowed to join our table to sit with us while we finished up and that she had to wait outside/in the waiting area.

Some notes:
Wait time was nonexistent at 9 am, it got busy quickly though. The waiting area was very small--just the vestibule with a heat lamp. Booths seated 6. Staff were friendly and polite. Although I wasn&apos;t a fan of the restaurants policies and they gave us a bad experience, I understand why they have them I&apos;m general."
5,"I love the bongo rooms pancakes! So do my children and ALL of my girlfriends. If you want a healthy option the Tomatillo salsa scramble is my go to and it&apos;s delicious. My husband liked the chorizo, potato and avocado omelette. He just reminded me that he actually likes everything at the bongo room so you can order anything and you will probably love it. Every pancake/French toast is yummy and unique in its own way. We typically order four or five different options then share family style with our kids. We have three children so seating is typically finagled but it always works out and they find us a table for five. The wait seems extra short due to all the fun shops in the area and the service is always prompt once seated."
4,"I feel like the only thing I need to say is that they serve Deconstructed. Lobster Roll. Eggs Benedict. Say it with me! 

This excited me because I&apos;m not used to seeing this type of benedict on any menu, so I took a chance. For $15.95. And it literally is a deconstructed lobster roll with poached eggs and hollandaise. The lobster meat was plentiful, the roll was nicely buttered and soft. The eggs and the hollandaise were just an added bonus. 

Let&apos;s also talk about the potatoes - they were cooked to perfection. Usually I have trouble finishing a side of potatoes because they can get so heavy. But the portion was excellent, and the consistency helped with consumption! Not too starchy. 

A wait is to be expected. According to my cousins, the Bongo Room is pretty popular in these parts. If you&apos;re visiting from out of town and want to try this for a weekend brunch, I suggest you plan your trip a bit early to account for waiting!"
5,"Food was yummy in the tummy.  The wait is long to get a table, but hey, it&apos;s a small space. 

It is noisy and there are loads of people here for breakfast and brunch on the weekends.

Facility is clean, servers are friendly.

The door and entry is not super ADA friendly.

The French toast was very heavy and it&apos;s a big portion so I would recommend sharing it. The best time to go is at 9am right when they open otherwise you&apos;re going to be waiting for a long time but it&apos;s definitely worth the wait. They do not have flavored creamers for the coffee which I would suggest for them to offer. Parking is also tricky in this area but I can&apos;t wait to come back to try more off the menu!
5,"Absolutely delicious brunch. Large portions. Got the croissant sandwich, deconstructed lobster roll, churro french toast and berry lemon pancakes. Every dish was flavorful. Highly recommend. 

Got pickup due to covid. Ordered online and was ready within 20 minutes."
5,Got takeout. It was amazing !!! Not one item I didnt love. And we couldn&apos;t eat it all!
3,"This place was good and good service, but I think my expectations were too high. They have a fun menu but the taste of the dishes themselves was average. For drinks, the coffee was good (just basic drip coffee), as was the chai tea latte. The chai latte was more milky and less spicy than I prefer, but still good. As for dishes, the best was the Apple and Pear Crumble French Toast- very flavorful toppings and fluffy french toast. We also tried the banana praline pancakes which had good flavors but not enough crunch. It almost tasted a bit mushy with all the sauce on it. Lastly, the lobster roll Benedict was tasty but came out cold. I think I would have liked this dish more if the lobster used was more plain (it tasted like tuna salad but with lobster). Overall good place if you&apos;re looking for brunch or breakfast nearby, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of your way to come here."
5,"I love Bongo Room! Such a fun, eclectic brunch spot. I love how fast they change menu&apos;s and incorporate seasonal faire. Out of the many times I&apos;ve eaten here my most favorite meals of all time where Strawberry Banana Pancakes and Red Velvet Cream Cheese Pancakes! Last I checked these menu items are not available ATM but could make a come back! I hope so because everyone deserves to try the SB ones. So yummy and sweet! It&apos;s like eating dessert for breakfast."
4,"Very high quality breakfast options with rich and flavorful options to choose from. I enjoyed the open and airy ambience that was able to accommodate large groups. 

I tried the BLT Benedict and was pleasantly surprised. It had a very nice sauce that complimented the egg yolk and kept the English muffin from leaving the plate too dry. I also appreciated that the portion size was large enough to satisfy my hunger.

One thing I will say I did not like was the space between the booths. I consider myself average size and the booths were so tight to the table I felt a little claustrophobic. I like to feel comfortable when eating, and I had to seriously concentrate to allow that to not center my attention while dining."
4,"Nice cafe, no words. But a lily bit pricey. They offer traditional breakfast options. Tasty omelette, home fries, but a bit crispy. The staff is very attentive. I never saw my glass empty;)"
5,"Bingo room you have my heart. I go here quite often, especially when things are actually open and you can sit down. This is by far my favorite breakfast place ever. My all time favorite is the strawberries and cream French toast. My second favorite- the pretzel pancakes. Yum. Grab a side of bacon and an iced tea and there you have the best breakfast ever. Service here is always pretty fast and I always leave enjoying my meal. I have taken to go as well and pancakes were hot, warm, and just as tasty. I highly recommend."
3,"The food was pretty good, my friend particularly loved her white chocolate pancakes. The restaurant was very busy and told us we could not be seated unless our whole party was ready. One of my friends has a gluten allergy and the server failed to communicate to the chef that the bread from his order should come on a separate plate--however they did remake it at no cost. 

We had a friend who was very late and arrived after we had already started eating. We asked if we could order her food, or food to go. They replied that they do not do to-go food on weekends and that they don&apos;t allow any orders after the first one has been made (Assumedly to stop people from taking too long at a table and keep things moving). They also told us she wouldn&apos;t be allowed to join our table to sit with us while we finished up and that she had to wait outside/in the waiting area.

Some notes:
Wait time was nonexistent at 9 am, it got busy quickly though. The waiting area was very small--just the vestibule with a heat lamp. Booths seated 6. Staff were friendly and polite. Although I wasn&apos;t a fan of the restaurants policies and they gave us a bad experience, I understand why they have them I&apos;m general."
5,"I love the bongo rooms pancakes! So do my children and ALL of my girlfriends. If you want a healthy option the Tomatillo salsa scramble is my go to and it&apos;s delicious. My husband liked the chorizo, potato and avocado omelette. He just reminded me that he actually likes everything at the bongo room so you can order anything and you will probably love it. Every pancake/French toast is yummy and unique in its own way. We typically order four or five different options then share family style with our kids. We have three children so seating is typically finagled but it always works out and they find us a table for five. The wait seems extra short due to all the fun shops in the area and the service is always prompt once seated."
4,"I feel like the only thing I need to say is that they serve Deconstructed. Lobster Roll. Eggs Benedict. Say it with me! 

This excited me because I&apos;m not used to seeing this type of benedict on any menu, so I took a chance. For $15.95. And it literally is a deconstructed lobster roll with poached eggs and hollandaise. The lobster meat was plentiful, the roll was nicely buttered and soft. The eggs and the hollandaise were just an added bonus. 

Let&apos;s also talk about the potatoes - they were cooked to perfection. Usually I have trouble finishing a side of potatoes because they can get so heavy. But the portion was excellent, and the consistency helped with consumption! Not too starchy. 

A wait is to be expected. According to my cousins, the Bongo Room is pretty popular in these parts. If you&apos;re visiting from out of town and want to try this for a weekend brunch, I suggest you plan your trip a bit early to account for waiting!"
5,"Food was yummy in the tummy.  The wait is long to get a table, but hey, it&apos;s a small space. 

It is noisy and there are loads of people here for breakfast and brunch on the weekends.

Facility is clean, servers are friendly.

The door and entry is not super ADA friendly.

The food was plentiful, flavorful, and rich.  Expect a heavy meal, not light."
5,"come hungry and ready to wait. on a sunday morning around 1030, youre looking at a good hour. leave your name and hit up a bar down the block while you wait. however, let me tell you - its worth every minute. the place is small and crammed, but the staff is great and the service is fast!

the irish coffee hit the spot and grew some hair on my chest. i gulped it down in 2 gulps. priced a bit high, but worth it since it woke me up and got me a nice buzz all in 1.

the lobster roll eggs benedict is a must get. its deconstructed, but a full on mess. the potatoes it comes with are delish too. its filling, and you will eat every last bite off the plate. as simple as it is, hollanidaise sauce its constantly messed up. not here, the bongo room nails their perfect hollaindaise sauce. they had a generous hand with the lobster meat too. 

the chocolate tower of french toast would be the next dish i order if i come back. i grabbed a few bites of my friends and fell in love instantly. its not overpowering with sweetness, and the chocolate is real chocolate!"
4,"Up until this last weekend, I was sole Chicagoan left who had not yet been to The Bongo Room. With three locations including one within walking distance of me, I had no excuse left not to give them a try!

When you go to Bongo Room, always expect a wait. We were quoted about 30 minutes so checked in, then grabbed some coffees next door. There are a million fab coffee shops right next to the Wicker Park location so waiting a few minutes is no problem at all.

We were seated at the counter and Jessica took care of us. She was so bubbly &amp; friendly for a Saturday morning! Perfect amount of service to check in on us but also leave us to our chatting. 

I had the BLT Pesto Benedict which was a unique offering and huge portion with a mountain of breakfast potatoes on the side. Loved this $15 dish and would def get it again. My friend had the Cinnamon Pear French Toast which I tried and whoa, was it indulgent and savory but very sweet &amp; tasty.

All in all, wonderful brunch at The Bongo Room and I&apos;d definitely pop in again for some eats."
4,"I went here on a Sunday morning after a weekend in Chicago. We had a party of 11 so we had to split between two tables. The place is fairly small so if you have a big group I would no recommend it. This is nothing against the food though, it was delicious! I got a caprese eggs Benedict with sweet Italian sausage. It was very good and I liked that it was on an English muffin. The potatoes were also good. My only complaint was that there was too much hollandaise sauce. Next time I would just ask for less. Overall I recommend this breakfast spot!"
4,"So far only tried the white chocolate caramel pancakes which were super tasty! I did a call in order so they were settled a bit and I had to heat them up when I made it home. Good topping, good portion, good flavor. Almost $15 after tax for just pancakes though which is a little much especially since you can&apos;t make them a platter but still enjoyed them."
3,"Fun restaurant, definitely need a reservation for brunch, decent food and prices.

I wanted to try a cute, brunch place in Wicker Park and Bongo Room kept showing up. We made a reservation, and thank goodness for that since it was a full house Saturday day. We got seated and I immediate was drawn to their pancakes. They no longer have the red velvet pancakes featured in the yelp photo. I got their pumpkin spice pancakes. Their cakes don&apos;t seem to be recommended with syrup since they come with sauces and creams of their own that the restaurant recommends. I also got a turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Both entrees had a lot of potential but had less flavor than I wanted them to. The server was delightful and the bill didn&apos;t make us cry so I&apos;m writing it off as a good experience but I will continue the hunt for cute, brunch spots."
4,"I had been to a different location Bongo Room in the past and decided to try this one during a visit to Chicago. We went shortly after opening on a Saturday morning so there where still plenty of open tables.

The menu is not too big, with a side dedicated to brunch (Saturdays and Sundays only). We ordered two savory dishes and one individual strawberry and banana pancakes (yes, you can order pancakes individually, though it does not explicitly say so on the menu).

I enjoyed my food, though wish the lobster benedict overall was more hot (temperature-wise). I also bit into a few fragments of lobster shell which was not so fun. The pancake was good but a bit dry and thick.

The interior is nice with an industrial feel. Service was probably the highlight of the meal, with a friendly host and server and waters brought to your table almost immediately after being seated.

Prices are fair and basically what I expected for brunch.

Overall, a solid meal though not quite as memorable as my previous visit.

P.S. The sink in the restroom is really unique, it has the hand dryer integrated into the faucet!"
2,"I had been wanting to come here for a couple years now, unfortunately just to be disappointed. When we arrived the hostess sat us at a very noticeably dirty table. I assumed she would ask someone to come clean it but she didn&apos;t. The guy that brought over our water and utensils moved us to a different table after noticing how dirty it was. I ordered a breakfast burrito which was supposed to be in a spinach tortilla but it wasn&apos;t, it came in a regular flour tortilla. It wouldn&apos;t have been a big deal if someone would&apos;ve just gave me a heads up but no one said anything. I guess they were hoping I didn&apos;t notice? The flavor was mediocre, definitely nothing to brag about. My son ordered eggs, bacon, house potatoes, and an English muffin. He wasn&apos;t impressed either. I paid $40 for brunch neither one of us particularly enjoyed."
4,"When picture of food from this place on Yelp, from their savory looking dishes to the foods sweet and scrumptiously looking, sugar filled French toast, I knew I had to stop by!

I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was nothing special. I wouldn&apos;t order it again just cause it didn&apos;t leave an impression on be. Also a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little (or a lot) of hot sauce couldn&apos;t fix.

The chocolate tower French toast was absolutely perfect. Very rich and chocolatey but not too sweet.

The service was a little on the slow side. Our glasses were only filled once and it took a lot of effort to get the waiters attention so I had to knock off one star. Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!"

A wait is to be expected. According to my cousins, the Bongo Room is pretty popular in these parts. If you&apos;re visiting from out of town and want to try this for a weekend brunch, I suggest you plan your trip a bit early to account for waiting!"
5,"Food was yummy in the tummy.  The wait is long to get a table, but hey, it&apos;s a small space. 

It is noisy and there are loads of people here for breakfast and brunch on the weekends.

Facility is clean, servers are friendly.

The door and entry is not super ADA friendly.

The food was plentiful, flavorful, and rich.  Expect a heavy meal, not light."
5,"come hungry and ready to wait. on a sunday morning around 1030, youre looking at a good hour. leave your name and hit up a bar down the block while you wait. however, let me tell you - its worth every minute. the place is small and crammed, but the staff is great and the service is fast!

the irish coffee hit the spot and grew some hair on my chest. i gulped it down in 2 gulps. priced a bit high, but worth it since it woke me up and got me a nice buzz all in 1.

the lobster roll eggs benedict is a must get. its deconstructed, but a full on mess. the potatoes it comes with are delish too. its filling, and you will eat every last bite off the plate. as simple as it is, hollanidaise sauce its constantly messed up. not here, the bongo room nails their perfect hollaindaise sauce. they had a generous hand with the lobster meat too. 

the chocolate tower of french toast would be the next dish i order if i come back. i grabbed a few bites of my friends and fell in love instantly. its not overpowering with sweetness, and the chocolate is real chocolate!"
4,"Up until this last weekend, I was sole Chicagoan left who had not yet been to The Bongo Room. With three locations including one within walking distance of me, I had no excuse left not to give them a try!

When you go to Bongo Room, always expect a wait. We were quoted about 30 minutes so checked in, then grabbed some coffees next door. There are a million fab coffee shops right next to the Wicker Park location so waiting a few minutes is no problem at all.

We were seated at the counter and Jessica took care of us. She was so bubbly &amp; friendly for a Saturday morning! Perfect amount of service to check in on us but also leave us to our chatting. 

I had the BLT Pesto Benedict which was a unique offering and huge portion with a mountain of breakfast potatoes on the side. Loved this $15 dish and would def get it again. My friend had the Cinnamon Pear French Toast which I tried and whoa, was it indulgent and savory but very sweet &amp; tasty.

All in all, wonderful brunch at The Bongo Room and I&apos;d definitely pop in again for some eats."
4,"I went here on a Sunday morning after a weekend in Chicago. We had a party of 11 so we had to split between two tables. The place is fairly small so if you have a big group I would no recommend it. This is nothing against the food though, it was delicious! I got a caprese eggs Benedict with sweet Italian sausage. It was very good and I liked that it was on an English muffin. The potatoes were also good. My only complaint was that there was too much hollandaise sauce. Next time I would just ask for less. Overall I recommend this breakfast spot!"
4,"So far only tried the white chocolate caramel pancakes which were super tasty! I did a call in order so they were settled a bit and I had to heat them up when I made it home. Good topping, good portion, good flavor. Almost $15 after tax for just pancakes though which is a little much especially since you can&apos;t make them a platter but still enjoyed them."
3,"Fun restaurant, definitely need a reservation for brunch, decent food and prices.

I wanted to try a cute, brunch place in Wicker Park and Bongo Room kept showing up. We made a reservation, and thank goodness for that since it was a full house Saturday day. We got seated and I immediate was drawn to their pancakes. They no longer have the red velvet pancakes featured in the yelp photo. I got their pumpkin spice pancakes. Their cakes don&apos;t seem to be recommended with syrup since they come with sauces and creams of their own that the restaurant recommends. I also got a turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Both entrees had a lot of potential but had less flavor than I wanted them to. The server was delightful and the bill didn&apos;t make us cry so I&apos;m writing it off as a good experience but I will continue the hunt for cute, brunch spots."
4,"I had been to a different location Bongo Room in the past and decided to try this one during a visit to Chicago. We went shortly after opening on a Saturday morning so there where still plenty of open tables.

The menu is not too big, with a side dedicated to brunch (Saturdays and Sundays only). We ordered two savory dishes and one individual strawberry and banana pancakes (yes, you can order pancakes individually, though it does not explicitly say so on the menu).

I enjoyed my food, though wish the lobster benedict overall was more hot (temperature-wise). I also bit into a few fragments of lobster shell which was not so fun. The pancake was good but a bit dry and thick.

The interior is nice with an industrial feel. Service was probably the highlight of the meal, with a friendly host and server and waters brought to your table almost immediately after being seated.

Prices are fair and basically what I expected for brunch.

Overall, a solid meal though not quite as memorable as my previous visit.

P.S. The sink in the restroom is really unique, it has the hand dryer integrated into the faucet!"
2,"I had been wanting to come here for a couple years now, unfortunately just to be disappointed. When we arrived the hostess sat us at a very noticeably dirty table. I assumed she would ask someone to come clean it but she didn&apos;t. The guy that brought over our water and utensils moved us to a different table after noticing how dirty it was. I ordered a breakfast burrito which was supposed to be in a spinach tortilla but it wasn&apos;t, it came in a regular flour tortilla. It wouldn&apos;t have been a big deal if someone would&apos;ve just gave me a heads up but no one said anything. I guess they were hoping I didn&apos;t notice? The flavor was mediocre, definitely nothing to brag about. My son ordered eggs, bacon, house potatoes, and an English muffin. He wasn&apos;t impressed either. I paid $40 for brunch neither one of us particularly enjoyed."
4,"When picture of food from this place on Yelp, from their savory looking dishes to the foods sweet and scrumptiously looking, sugar filled French toast, I knew I had to stop by!

I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was nothing special. I wouldn&apos;t order it again just cause it didn&apos;t leave an impression on be. Also a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little (or a lot) of hot sauce couldn&apos;t fix.

The chocolate tower French toast was absolutely perfect. Very rich and chocolatey but not too sweet.

The service was a little on the slow side. Our glasses were only filled once and it took a lot of effort to get the waiters attention so I had to knock off one star. Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!"
5,I love this place. Might be my new favorite brunch spot. I had the lobster roll Benedict and the chocolate tower French toast. It was mouth watering and very filling. The French toast was very heavy and it&apos;s a big portion so I would recommend sharing it. The best time to go is at 9am right when they open otherwise you&apos;re going to be waiting for a long time but it&apos;s definitely worth the wait. They do not have flavored creamers for the coffee which I would suggest for them to offer. Parking is also tricky in this area but I can&apos;t wait to come back to try more off the menu!
5,"Absolutely delicious brunch. Large portions. Got the croissant sandwich, deconstructed lobster roll, churro french toast and berry lemon pancakes. Every dish was flavorful. Highly recommend. 

Got pickup due to covid. Ordered online and was ready within 20 minutes."
5,Got takeout. It was amazing !!! Not one item I didnt love. And we couldn&apos;t eat it all!
3,"This place was good and good service, but I think my expectations were too high. They have a fun menu but the taste of the dishes themselves was average. For drinks, the coffee was good (just basic drip coffee), as was the chai tea latte. The chai latte was more milky and less spicy than I prefer, but still good. As for dishes, the best was the Apple and Pear Crumble French Toast- very flavorful toppings and fluffy french toast. We also tried the banana praline pancakes which had good flavors but not enough crunch. It almost tasted a bit mushy with all the sauce on it. Lastly, the lobster roll Benedict was tasty but came out cold. I think I would have liked this dish more if the lobster used was more plain (it tasted like tuna salad but with lobster). Overall good place if you&apos;re looking for brunch or breakfast nearby, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of your way to come here."
5,"I love Bongo Room! Such a fun, eclectic brunch spot. I love how fast they change menu&apos;s and incorporate seasonal faire. Out of the many times I&apos;ve eaten here my most favorite meals of all time where Strawberry Banana Pancakes and Red Velvet Cream Cheese Pancakes! Last I checked these menu items are not available ATM but could make a come back! I hope so because everyone deserves to try the SB ones. So yummy and sweet! It&apos;s like eating dessert for breakfast."
4,"Very high quality breakfast options with rich and flavorful options to choose from. I enjoyed the open and airy ambience that was able to accommodate large groups. 

I tried the BLT Benedict and was pleasantly surprised. It had a very nice sauce that complimented the egg yolk and kept the English muffin from leaving the plate too dry. I also appreciated that the portion size was large enough to satisfy my hunger.

One thing I will say I did not like was the space between the booths. I consider myself average size and the booths were so tight to the table I felt a little claustrophobic. I like to feel comfortable when eating, and I had to seriously concentrate to allow that to not center my attention while dining."
4,"Nice cafe, no words. But a lily bit pricey. They offer traditional breakfast options. Tasty omelette, home fries, but a bit crispy. The staff is very attentive. I never saw my glass empty;)"
5,"Bingo room you have my heart. I go here quite often, especially when things are actually open and you can sit down. This is by far my favorite breakfast place ever. My all time favorite is the strawberries and cream French toast. My second favorite- the pretzel pancakes. Yum. Grab a side of bacon and an iced tea and there you have the best breakfast ever. Service here is always pretty fast and I always leave enjoying my meal. I have taken to go as well and pancakes were hot, warm, and just as tasty. I highly recommend."
3,"The food was pretty good, my friend particularly loved her white chocolate pancakes. The restaurant was very busy and told us we could not be seated unless our whole party was ready. One of my friends has a gluten allergy and the server failed to communicate to the chef that the bread from his order should come on a separate plate--however they did remake it at no cost. 

We had a friend who was very late and arrived after we had already started eating. We asked if we could order her food, or food to go. They replied that they do not do to-go food on weekends and that they don&apos;t allow any orders after the first one has been made (Assumedly to stop people from taking too long at a table and keep things moving). They also told us she wouldn&apos;t be allowed to join our table to sit with us while we finished up and that she had to wait outside/in the waiting area.

Some notes:
Wait time was nonexistent at 9 am, it got busy quickly though. The waiting area was very small--just the vestibule with a heat lamp. Booths seated 6. Staff were friendly and polite. Although I wasn&apos;t a fan of the restaurants policies and they gave us a bad experience, I understand why they have them I&apos;m general."
5,"I love the bongo rooms pancakes! So do my children and ALL of my girlfriends. If you want a healthy option the Tomatillo salsa scramble is my go to and it&apos;s delicious. My husband liked the chorizo, potato and avocado omelette. He just reminded me that he actually likes everything at the bongo room so you can order anything and you will probably love it. Every pancake/French toast is yummy and unique in its own way. We typically order four or five different options then share family style with our kids. We have three children so seating is typically finagled but it always works out and they find us a table for five. The wait seems extra short due to all the fun shops in the area and the service is always prompt once seated."
4,"I feel like the only thing I need to say is that they serve Deconstructed. Lobster Roll. Eggs Benedict. Say it with me! 

This excited me because I&apos;m not used to seeing this type of benedict on any menu, so I took a chance. For $15.95. And it literally is a deconstructed lobster roll with poached eggs and hollandaise. The lobster meat was plentiful, the roll was nicely buttered and soft. The eggs and the hollandaise were just an added bonus. 

Let&apos;s also talk about the potatoes - they were cooked to perfection. Usually I have trouble finishing a side of potatoes because they can get so heavy. But the portion was excellent, and the consistency helped with consumption! Not too starchy.

4,"When picture of food from this place on Yelp, from their savory looking dishes to the foods sweet and scrumptiously looking, sugar filled French toast, I knew I had to stop by!

I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was nothing special. I wouldn&apos;t order it again just cause it didn&apos;t leave an impression on be. Also a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little (or a lot) of hot sauce couldn&apos;t fix.

The chocolate tower French toast was absolutely perfect. Very rich and chocolatey but not too sweet.

The service was a little on the slow side. Our glasses were only filled once and it took a lot of effort to get the waiters attention so I had to knock off one star. Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!"
5,I love this place. Might be my new favorite brunch spot. I had the lobster roll Benedict and the chocolate tower French toast. It was mouth watering and very filling. The French toast was very heavy and it&apos;s a big portion so I would recommend sharing it. The best time to go is at 9am right when they open otherwise you&apos;re going to be waiting for a long time but it&apos;s definitely worth the wait. They do not have flavored creamers for the coffee which I would suggest for them to offer. Parking is also tricky in this area but I can&apos;t wait to come back to try more off the menu!
5,"Absolutely delicious brunch. Large portions. Got the croissant sandwich, deconstructed lobster roll, churro french toast and berry lemon pancakes. Every dish was flavorful. Highly recommend. 

Got pickup due to covid. Ordered online and was ready within 20 minutes."
5,Got takeout. It was amazing !!! Not one item I didnt love. And we couldn&apos;t eat it all!
3,"This place was good and good service, but I think my expectations were too high. They have a fun menu but the taste of the dishes themselves was average. For drinks, the coffee was good (just basic drip coffee), as was the chai tea latte. The chai latte was more milky and less spicy than I prefer, but still good. As for dishes, the best was the Apple and Pear Crumble French Toast- very flavorful toppings and fluffy french toast. We also tried the banana praline pancakes which had good flavors but not enough crunch. It almost tasted a bit mushy with all the sauce on it. Lastly, the lobster roll Benedict was tasty but came out cold. I think I would have liked this dish more if the lobster used was more plain (it tasted like tuna salad but with lobster). Overall good place if you&apos;re looking for brunch or breakfast nearby, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of your way to come here."
5,"I love Bongo Room! Such a fun, eclectic brunch spot. I love how fast they change menu&apos;s and incorporate seasonal faire. Out of the many times I&apos;ve eaten here my most favorite meals of all time where Strawberry Banana Pancakes and Red Velvet Cream Cheese Pancakes! Last I checked these menu items are not available ATM but could make a come back! I hope so because everyone deserves to try the SB ones. So yummy and sweet! It&apos;s like eating dessert for breakfast."
4,"Very high quality breakfast options with rich and flavorful options to choose from. I enjoyed the open and airy ambience that was able to accommodate large groups. 

I tried the BLT Benedict and was pleasantly surprised. It had a very nice sauce that complimented the egg yolk and kept the English muffin from leaving the plate too dry. I also appreciated that the portion size was large enough to satisfy my hunger.

One thing I will say I did not like was the space between the booths. I consider myself average size and the booths were so tight to the table I felt a little claustrophobic. I like to feel comfortable when eating, and I had to seriously concentrate to allow that to not center my attention while dining."
4,"Nice cafe, no words. But a lily bit pricey. They offer traditional breakfast options. Tasty omelette, home fries, but a bit crispy. The staff is very attentive. I never saw my glass empty;)"
5,"Bingo room you have my heart. I go here quite often, especially when things are actually open and you can sit down. This is by far my favorite breakfast place ever. My all time favorite is the strawberries and cream French toast. My second favorite- the pretzel pancakes. Yum. Grab a side of bacon and an iced tea and there you have the best breakfast ever. Service here is always pretty fast and I always leave enjoying my meal. I have taken to go as well and pancakes were hot, warm, and just as tasty. I highly recommend."
3,"The food was pretty good, my friend particularly loved her white chocolate pancakes. The restaurant was very busy and told us we could not be seated unless our whole party was ready. One of my friends has a gluten allergy and the server failed to communicate to the chef that the bread from his order should come on a separate plate--however they did remake it at no cost. 

We had a friend who was very late and arrived after we had already started eating. We asked if we could order her food, or food to go. They replied that they do not do to-go food on weekends and that they don&apos;t allow any orders after the first one has been made (Assumedly to stop people from taking too long at a table and keep things moving). They also told us she wouldn&apos;t be allowed to join our table to sit with us while we finished up and that she had to wait outside/in the waiting area.

Some notes:
Wait time was nonexistent at 9 am, it got busy quickly though. The waiting area was very small--just the vestibule with a heat lamp. Booths seated 6. Staff were friendly and polite. Although I wasn&apos;t a fan of the restaurants policies and they gave us a bad experience, I understand why they have them I&apos;m general."
5,"I love the bongo rooms pancakes! So do my children and ALL of my girlfriends. If you want a healthy option the Tomatillo salsa scramble is my go to and it&apos;s delicious. My husband liked the chorizo, potato and avocado omelette. He just reminded me that he actually likes everything at the bongo room so you can order anything and you will probably love it. Every pancake/French toast is yummy and unique in its own way. We typically order four or five different options then share family style with our kids. We have three children so seating is typically finagled but it always works out and they find us a table for five. The wait seems extra short due to all the fun shops in the area and the service is always prompt once seated."
4,"I feel like the only thing I need to say is that they serve Deconstructed. Lobster Roll. Eggs Benedict. Say it with me! 

This excited me because I&apos;m not used to seeing this type of benedict on any menu, so I took a chance. For $15.95. And it literally is a deconstructed lobster roll with poached eggs and hollandaise. The lobster meat was plentiful, the roll was nicely buttered and soft. The eggs and the hollandaise were just an added bonus. 

Let&apos;s also talk about the potatoes - they were cooked to perfection. Usually I have trouble finishing a side of potatoes because they can get so heavy. But the portion was excellent, and the consistency helped with consumption! Not too starchy. 

A wait is to be expected. According to my cousins, the Bongo Room is pretty popular in these parts. If you&apos;re visiting from out of town and want to try this for a weekend brunch, I suggest you plan your trip a bit early to account for waiting!"
5,"Food was yummy in the tummy.  The wait is long to get a table, but hey, it&apos;s a small space. 

It is noisy and there are loads of people here for breakfast and brunch on the weekends.

Facility is clean, servers are friendly.

The door and entry is not super ADA friendly.

The food was plentiful, flavorful, and rich.  Expect a heavy meal, not light."
5,"come hungry and ready to wait. on a sunday morning around 1030, youre looking at a good hour. leave your name and hit up a bar down the block while you wait. however, let me tell you - its worth every minute. the place is small and crammed, but the staff is great and the service is fast!

the irish coffee hit the spot and grew some hair on my chest. i gulped it down in 2 gulps. priced a bit high, but worth it since it woke me up and got me a nice buzz all in 1.

the lobster roll eggs benedict is a must get. its deconstructed, but a full on mess. the potatoes it comes with are delish too. its filling, and you will eat every last bite off the plate. as simple as it is, hollanidaise sauce its constantly messed up. not here, the bongo room nails their perfect hollaindaise sauce. they had a generous hand with the lobster meat too. 

the chocolate tower of french toast would be the next dish i order if i come back. i grabbed a few bites of my friends and fell in love instantly. its not overpowering with sweetness, and the chocolate is real chocolate!"
4,"Up until this last weekend, I was sole Chicagoan left who had not yet been to The Bongo Room. With three locations including one within walking distance of me, I had no excuse left not to give them a try!

When you go to Bongo Room, always expect a wait. We were quoted about 30 minutes so checked in, then grabbed some coffees next door. There are a million fab coffee shops right next to the Wicker Park location so waiting a few minutes is no problem at all.

We were seated at the counter and Jessica took care of us. She was so bubbly &amp; friendly for a Saturday morning! Perfect amount of service to check in on us but also leave us to our chatting. 

I had the BLT Pesto Benedict which was a unique offering and huge portion with a mountain of breakfast potatoes on the side. Loved this $15 dish and would def get it again. My friend had the Cinnamon Pear French Toast which I tried and whoa, was it indulgent and savory but very sweet &amp; tasty.

All in all, wonderful brunch at The Bongo Room and I&apos;d definitely pop in again for some eats."
4,"I went here on a Sunday morning after a weekend in Chicago. We had a party of 11 so we had to split between two tables. The place is fairly small so if you have a big group I would no recommend it. This is nothing against the food though, it was delicious! I got a caprese eggs Benedict with sweet Italian sausage. It was very good and I liked that it was on an English muffin. The potatoes were also good. My only complaint was that there was too much hollandaise sauce. Next time I would just ask for less. Overall I recommend this breakfast spot!"
4,"So far only tried the white chocolate caramel pancakes which were super tasty! I did a call in order so they were settled a bit and I had to heat them up when I made it home. Good topping, good portion, good flavor. Almost $15 after tax for just pancakes though which is a little much especially since you can&apos;t make them a platter but still enjoyed them."
3,"Fun restaurant, definitely need a reservation for brunch, decent food and prices.

I wanted to try a cute, brunch place in Wicker Park and Bongo Room kept showing up. We made a reservation, and thank goodness for that since it was a full house Saturday day. We got seated and I immediate was drawn to their pancakes. They no longer have the red velvet pancakes featured in the yelp photo. I got their pumpkin spice pancakes. Their cakes don&apos;t seem to be recommended with syrup since they come with sauces and creams of their own that the restaurant recommends. I also got a turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Both entrees had a lot of potential but had less flavor than I wanted them to. The server was delightful and the bill didn&apos;t make us cry so I&apos;m writing it off as a good experience but I will continue the hunt for cute, brunch spots."
4,"I had been to a different location Bongo Room in the past and decided to try this one during a visit to Chicago. We went shortly after opening on a Saturday morning so there where still plenty of open tables.

The menu is not too big, with a side dedicated to brunch (Saturdays and Sundays only). We ordered two savory dishes and one individual strawberry and banana pancakes (yes, you can order pancakes individually, though it does not explicitly say so on the menu).

I enjoyed my food, though wish the lobster benedict overall was more hot (temperature-wise). I also bit into a few fragments of lobster shell which was not so fun. The pancake was good but a bit dry and thick.

The interior is nice with an industrial feel. Service was probably the highlight of the meal, with a friendly host and server and waters brought to your table almost immediately after being seated.

Prices are fair and basically what I expected for brunch.

Overall, a solid meal though not quite as memorable as my previous visit.

P.S. The sink in the restroom is really unique, it has the hand dryer integrated into the faucet!"
2,"I had been wanting to come here for a couple years now, unfortunately just to be disappointed. When we arrived the hostess sat us at a very noticeably dirty table. I assumed she would ask someone to come clean it but she didn&apos;t. The guy that brought over our water and utensils moved us to a different table after noticing how dirty it was. I ordered a breakfast burrito which was supposed to be in a spinach tortilla but it wasn&apos;t, it came in a regular flour tortilla. It wouldn&apos;t have been a big deal if someone would&apos;ve just gave me a heads up but no one said anything. I guess they were hoping I didn&apos;t notice? The flavor was mediocre, definitely nothing to brag about. My son ordered eggs, bacon, house potatoes, and an English muffin. He wasn&apos;t impressed either. I paid $40 for brunch neither one of us particularly enjoyed."

This excited me because I&apos;m not used to seeing this type of benedict on any menu, so I took a chance. For $15.95. And it literally is a deconstructed lobster roll with poached eggs and hollandaise. The lobster meat was plentiful, the roll was nicely buttered and soft. The eggs and the hollandaise were just an added bonus. 

Let&apos;s also talk about the potatoes - they were cooked to perfection. Usually I have trouble finishing a side of potatoes because they can get so heavy. But the portion was excellent, and the consistency helped with consumption! Not too starchy. 

A wait is to be expected. According to my cousins, the Bongo Room is pretty popular in these parts. If you&apos;re visiting from out of town and want to try this for a weekend brunch, I suggest you plan your trip a bit early to account for waiting!"
5,"Food was yummy in the tummy.  The wait is long to get a table, but hey, it&apos;s a small space. 

It is noisy and there are loads of people here for breakfast and brunch on the weekends.

Facility is clean, servers are friendly.

The door and entry is not super ADA friendly.

The food was plentiful, flavorful, and rich.  Expect a heavy meal, not light."
5,"come hungry and ready to wait. on a sunday morning around 1030, youre looking at a good hour. leave your name and hit up a bar down the block while you wait. however, let me tell you - its worth every minute. the place is small and crammed, but the staff is great and the service is fast!

the irish coffee hit the spot and grew some hair on my chest. i gulped it down in 2 gulps. priced a bit high, but worth it since it woke me up and got me a nice buzz all in 1.

the lobster roll eggs benedict is a must get. its deconstructed, but a full on mess. the potatoes it comes with are delish too. its filling, and you will eat every last bite off the plate. as simple as it is, hollanidaise sauce its constantly messed up. not here, the bongo room nails their perfect hollaindaise sauce. they had a generous hand with the lobster meat too. 

the chocolate tower of french toast would be the next dish i order if i come back. i grabbed a few bites of my friends and fell in love instantly. its not overpowering with sweetness, and the chocolate is real chocolate!"
4,"Up until this last weekend, I was sole Chicagoan left who had not yet been to The Bongo Room. With three locations including one within walking distance of me, I had no excuse left not to give them a try!

When you go to Bongo Room, always expect a wait. We were quoted about 30 minutes so checked in, then grabbed some coffees next door. There are a million fab coffee shops right next to the Wicker Park location so waiting a few minutes is no problem at all.

We were seated at the counter and Jessica took care of us. She was so bubbly &amp; friendly for a Saturday morning! Perfect amount of service to check in on us but also leave us to our chatting. 

I had the BLT Pesto Benedict which was a unique offering and huge portion with a mountain of breakfast potatoes on the side. Loved this $15 dish and would def get it again. My friend had the Cinnamon Pear French Toast which I tried and whoa, was it indulgent and savory but very sweet &amp; tasty.

All in all, wonderful brunch at The Bongo Room and I&apos;d definitely pop in again for some eats."
4,"I went here on a Sunday morning after a weekend in Chicago. We had a party of 11 so we had to split between two tables. The place is fairly small so if you have a big group I would no recommend it. This is nothing against the food though, it was delicious! I got a caprese eggs Benedict with sweet Italian sausage. It was very good and I liked that it was on an English muffin. The potatoes were also good. My only complaint was that there was too much hollandaise sauce. Next time I would just ask for less. Overall I recommend this breakfast spot!"
4,"So far only tried the white chocolate caramel pancakes which were super tasty! I did a call in order so they were settled a bit and I had to heat them up when I made it home. Good topping, good portion, good flavor. Almost $15 after tax for just pancakes though which is a little much especially since you can&apos;t make them a platter but still enjoyed them."
3,"Fun restaurant, definitely need a reservation for brunch, decent food and prices.

I wanted to try a cute, brunch place in Wicker Park and Bongo Room kept showing up. We made a reservation, and thank goodness for that since it was a full house Saturday day. We got seated and I immediate was drawn to their pancakes. They no longer have the red velvet pancakes featured in the yelp photo. I got their pumpkin spice pancakes. Their cakes don&apos;t seem to be recommended with syrup since they come with sauces and creams of their own that the restaurant recommends. I also got a turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Both entrees had a lot of potential but had less flavor than I wanted them to. The server was delightful and the bill didn&apos;t make us cry so I&apos;m writing it off as a good experience but I will continue the hunt for cute, brunch spots."
4,"I had been to a different location Bongo Room in the past and decided to try this one during a visit to Chicago. We went shortly after opening on a Saturday morning so there where still plenty of open tables.

The menu is not too big, with a side dedicated to brunch (Saturdays and Sundays only). We ordered two savory dishes and one individual strawberry and banana pancakes (yes, you can order pancakes individually, though it does not explicitly say so on the menu).

I enjoyed my food, though wish the lobster benedict overall was more hot (temperature-wise). I also bit into a few fragments of lobster shell which was not so fun. The pancake was good but a bit dry and thick.

The interior is nice with an industrial feel. Service was probably the highlight of the meal, with a friendly host and server and waters brought to your table almost immediately after being seated.

Prices are fair and basically what I expected for brunch.

Overall, a solid meal though not quite as memorable as my previous visit.

P.S. The sink in the restroom is really unique, it has the hand dryer integrated into the faucet!"
2,"I had been wanting to come here for a couple years now, unfortunately just to be disappointed. When we arrived the hostess sat us at a very noticeably dirty table. I assumed she would ask someone to come clean it but she didn&apos;t. The guy that brought over our water and utensils moved us to a different table after noticing how dirty it was. I ordered a breakfast burrito which was supposed to be in a spinach tortilla but it wasn&apos;t, it came in a regular flour tortilla. It wouldn&apos;t have been a big deal if someone would&apos;ve just gave me a heads up but no one said anything. I guess they were hoping I didn&apos;t notice? The flavor was mediocre, definitely nothing to brag about. My son ordered eggs, bacon, house potatoes, and an English muffin. He wasn&apos;t impressed either. I paid $40 for brunch neither one of us particularly enjoyed."
4,"When picture of food from this place on Yelp, from their savory looking dishes to the foods sweet and scrumptiously looking, sugar filled French toast, I knew I had to stop by!

I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was nothing special. I wouldn&apos;t order it again just cause it didn&apos;t leave an impression on be. Also a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little (or a lot) of hot sauce couldn&apos;t fix.

The chocolate tower French toast was absolutely perfect. Very rich and chocolatey but not too sweet.

The service was a little on the slow side. Our glasses were only filled once and it took a lot of effort to get the waiters attention so I had to knock off one star. Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!"
5,I love this place. Might be my new favorite brunch spot. I had the lobster roll Benedict and the chocolate tower French toast. It was mouth watering and very filling. The French toast was very heavy and it&apos;s a big portion so I would recommend sharing it. The best time to go is at 9am right when they open otherwise you&apos;re going to be waiting for a long time but it&apos;s definitely worth the wait. They do not have flavored creamers for the coffee which I would suggest for them to offer. Parking is also tricky in this area but I can&apos;t wait to come back to try more off the menu!
5,"Absolutely delicious brunch. Large portions. Got the croissant sandwich, deconstructed lobster roll, churro french toast and berry lemon pancakes. Every dish was flavorful. Highly recommend. 

Got pickup due to covid. Ordered online and was ready within 20 minutes."
5,Got takeout. It was amazing !!! Not one item I didnt love. And we couldn&apos;t eat it all!
3,"This place was good and good service, but I think my expectations were too high. They have a fun menu but the taste of the dishes themselves was average. For drinks, the coffee was good (just basic drip coffee), as was the chai tea latte. The chai latte was more milky and less spicy than I prefer, but still good. As for dishes, the best was the Apple and Pear Crumble French Toast- very flavorful toppings and fluffy french toast. We also tried the banana praline pancakes which had good flavors but not enough crunch. It almost tasted a bit mushy with all the sauce on it. Lastly, the lobster roll Benedict was tasty but came out cold. I think I would have liked this dish more if the lobster used was more plain (it tasted like tuna salad but with lobster). Overall good place if you&apos;re looking for brunch or breakfast nearby, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of your way to come here."
5,"I love Bongo Room! Such a fun, eclectic brunch spot. I love how fast they change menu&apos;s and incorporate seasonal faire. Out of the many times I&apos;ve eaten here my most favorite meals of all time where Strawberry Banana Pancakes and Red Velvet Cream Cheese Pancakes! Last I checked these menu items are not available ATM but could make a come back! I hope so because everyone deserves to try the SB ones. So yummy and sweet! It&apos;s like eating dessert for breakfast."
4,"Very high quality breakfast options with rich and flavorful options to choose from. I enjoyed the open and airy ambience that was able to accommodate large groups. 

I tried the BLT Benedict and was pleasantly surprised. It had a very nice sauce that complimented the egg yolk and kept the English muffin from leaving the plate too dry. I also appreciated that the portion size was large enough to satisfy my hunger.

One thing I will say I did not like was the space between the booths. I consider myself average size and the booths were so tight to the table I felt a little claustrophobic. I like to feel comfortable when eating, and I had to seriously concentrate to allow that to not center my attention while dining."
4,"Nice cafe, no words. But a lily bit pricey. They offer traditional breakfast options. Tasty omelette, home fries, but a bit crispy. The staff is very attentive. I never saw my glass empty;)"
5,"Bingo room you have my heart. I go here quite often, especially when things are actually open and you can sit down. This is by far my favorite breakfast place ever. My all time favorite is the strawberries and cream French toast. My second favorite- the pretzel pancakes. Yum. Grab a side of bacon and an iced tea and there you have the best breakfast ever. Service here is always pretty fast and I always leave enjoying my meal. I have taken to go as well and pancakes were hot, warm, and just as tasty. I highly recommend."
3,"The food was pretty good, my friend particularly loved her white chocolate pancakes. The restaurant was very busy and told us we could not be seated unless our whole party was ready. One of my friends has a gluten allergy and the server failed to communicate to the chef that the bread from his order should come on a separate plate--however they did remake it at no cost. 

We had a friend who was very late and arrived after we had already started eating. We asked if we could order her food, or food to go. They replied that they do not do to-go food on weekends and that they don&apos;t allow any orders after the first one has been made (Assumedly to stop people from taking too long at a table and keep things moving). They also told us she wouldn&apos;t be allowed to join our table to sit with us while we finished up and that she had to wait outside/in the waiting area.

Some notes:
Wait time was nonexistent at 9 am, it got busy quickly though. The waiting area was very small--just the vestibule with a heat lamp. Booths seated 6. Staff were friendly and polite. Although I wasn&apos;t a fan of the restaurants policies and they gave us a bad experience, I understand why they have them I&apos;m general."
5,"I love the bongo rooms pancakes! So do my children and ALL of my girlfriends. If you want a healthy option the Tomatillo salsa scramble is my go to and it&apos;s delicious. My husband liked the chorizo, potato and avocado omelette. He just reminded me that he actually likes everything at the bongo room so you can order anything and you will probably love it. Every pancake/French toast is yummy and unique in its own way. We typically order four or five different options then share family style with our kids. We have three children so seating is typically finagled but it always works out and they find us a table for five. The wait seems extra short due to all the fun shops in the area and the service is always prompt once seated."

I ordered a breakfast burrito which was supposed to be in a spinach tortilla but it wasn&apos;t, it came in a regular flour tortilla. It wouldn&apos;t have been a big deal if someone would&apos;ve just gave me a heads up but no one said anything. I guess they were hoping I didn&apos;t notice? The flavor was mediocre, definitely nothing to brag about. My son ordered eggs, bacon, house potatoes, and an English muffin. He wasn&apos;t impressed either. I paid $40 for brunch neither one of us particularly enjoyed."
4,"When picture of food from this place on Yelp, from their savory looking dishes to the foods sweet and scrumptiously looking, sugar filled French toast, I knew I had to stop by!

I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was nothing special. I wouldn&apos;t order it again just cause it didn&apos;t leave an impression on be. Also a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little (or a lot) of hot sauce couldn&apos;t fix.

The chocolate tower French toast was absolutely perfect. Very rich and chocolatey but not too sweet.

The service was a little on the slow side. Our glasses were only filled once and it took a lot of effort to get the waiters attention so I had to knock off one star. Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!"
5,I love this place. Might be my new favorite brunch spot. I had the lobster roll Benedict and the chocolate tower French toast. It was mouth watering and very filling. The French toast was very heavy and it&apos;s a big portion so I would recommend sharing it. The best time to go is at 9am right when they open otherwise you&apos;re going to be waiting for a long time but it&apos;s definitely worth the wait. They do not have flavored creamers for the coffee which I would suggest for them to offer. Parking is also tricky in this area but I can&apos;t wait to come back to try more off the menu!
5,"Absolutely delicious brunch. Large portions. Got the croissant sandwich, deconstructed lobster roll, churro french toast and berry lemon pancakes. Every dish was flavorful. Highly recommend. 

Got pickup due to covid. Ordered online and was ready within 20 minutes."
5,Got takeout. It was amazing !!! Not one item I didnt love. And we couldn&apos;t eat it all!
3,"This place was good and good service, but I think my expectations were too high. They have a fun menu but the taste of the dishes themselves was average. For drinks, the coffee was good (just basic drip coffee), as was the chai tea latte. The chai latte was more milky and less spicy than I prefer, but still good. As for dishes, the best was the Apple and Pear Crumble French Toast- very flavorful toppings and fluffy french toast. We also tried the banana praline pancakes which had good flavors but not enough crunch. It almost tasted a bit mushy with all the sauce on it. Lastly, the lobster roll Benedict was tasty but came out cold. I think I would have liked this dish more if the lobster used was more plain (it tasted like tuna salad but with lobster). Overall good place if you&apos;re looking for brunch or breakfast nearby, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of your way to come here."
5,"I love Bongo Room! Such a fun, eclectic brunch spot. I love how fast they change menu&apos;s and incorporate seasonal faire. Out of the many times I&apos;ve eaten here my most favorite meals of all time where Strawberry Banana Pancakes and Red Velvet Cream Cheese Pancakes! Last I checked these menu items are not available ATM but could make a come back! I hope so because everyone deserves to try the SB ones. So yummy and sweet! It&apos;s like eating dessert for breakfast."
4,"Very high quality breakfast options with rich and flavorful options to choose from. I enjoyed the open and airy ambience that was able to accommodate large groups. 

I tried the BLT Benedict and was pleasantly surprised. It had a very nice sauce that complimented the egg yolk and kept the English muffin from leaving the plate too dry. I also appreciated that the portion size was large enough to satisfy my hunger.

One thing I will say I did not like was the space between the booths. I consider myself average size and the booths were so tight to the table I felt a little claustrophobic. I like to feel comfortable when eating, and I had to seriously concentrate to allow that to not center my attention while dining."
4,"Nice cafe, no words. But a lily bit pricey. They offer traditional breakfast options. Tasty omelette, home fries, but a bit crispy. The staff is very attentive. I never saw my glass empty;)"
5,"Bingo room you have my heart. I go here quite often, especially when things are actually open and you can sit down. This is by far my favorite breakfast place ever. My all time favorite is the strawberries and cream French toast. My second favorite- the pretzel pancakes. Yum. Grab a side of bacon and an iced tea and there you have the best breakfast ever. Service here is always pretty fast and I always leave enjoying my meal. I have taken to go as well and pancakes were hot, warm, and just as tasty. I highly recommend."
3,"The food was pretty good, my friend particularly loved her white chocolate pancakes. The restaurant was very busy and told us we could not be seated unless our whole party was ready. One of my friends has a gluten allergy and the server failed to communicate to the chef that the bread from his order should come on a separate plate--however they did remake it at no cost. 

We had a friend who was very late and arrived after we had already started eating. We asked if we could order her food, or food to go. They replied that they do not do to-go food on weekends and that they don&apos;t allow any orders after the first one has been made (Assumedly to stop people from taking too long at a table and keep things moving). They also told us she wouldn&apos;t be allowed to join our table to sit with us while we finished up and that she had to wait outside/in the waiting area.

Some notes:
Wait time was nonexistent at 9 am, it got busy quickly though. The waiting area was very small--just the vestibule with a heat lamp. Booths seated 6. Staff were friendly and polite. Although I wasn&apos;t a fan of the restaurants policies and they gave us a bad experience, I understand why they have them I&apos;m general."
5,"I love the bongo rooms pancakes! So do my children and ALL of my girlfriends. If you want a healthy option the Tomatillo salsa scramble is my go to and it&apos;s delicious. My husband liked the chorizo, potato and avocado omelette. He just reminded me that he actually likes everything at the bongo room so you can order anything and you will probably love it. Every pancake/French toast is yummy and unique in its own way. We typically order four or five different options then share family style with our kids. We have three children so seating is typically finagled but it always works out and they find us a table for five. The wait seems extra short due to all the fun shops in the area and the service is always prompt once seated."
4,"I feel like the only thing I need to say is that they serve Deconstructed. Lobster Roll. Eggs Benedict. Say it with me! 

This excited me because I&apos;m not used to seeing this type of benedict on any menu, so I took a chance. For $15.95. And it literally is a deconstructed lobster roll with poached eggs and hollandaise. The lobster meat was plentiful, the roll was nicely buttered and soft. The eggs and the hollandaise were just an added bonus. 

Let&apos;s also talk about the potatoes - they were cooked to perfection. Usually I have trouble finishing a side of potatoes because they can get so heavy. But the portion was excellent, and the consistency helped with consumption! Not too starchy. 

A wait is to be expected. According to my cousins, the Bongo Room is pretty popular in these parts. If you&apos;re visiting from out of town and want to try this for a weekend brunch, I suggest you plan your trip a bit early to account for waiting!"
5,"Food was yummy in the tummy.  The wait is long to get a table, but hey, it&apos;s a small space. 

It is noisy and there are loads of people here for breakfast and brunch on the weekends.

Facility is clean, servers are friendly.

The door and entry is not super ADA friendly.

The food was plentiful, flavorful, and rich.  Expect a heavy meal, not light."
5,"come hungry and ready to wait. on a sunday morning around 1030, youre looking at a good hour. leave your name and hit up a bar down the block while you wait. however, let me tell you - its worth every minute. the place is small and crammed, but the staff is great and the service is fast!

the irish coffee hit the spot and grew some hair on my chest. i gulped it down in 2 gulps. priced a bit high, but worth it since it woke me up and got me a nice buzz all in 1.

the lobster roll eggs benedict is a must get. its deconstructed, but a full on mess. the potatoes it comes with are delish too. its filling, and you will eat every last bite off the plate. as simple as it is, hollanidaise sauce its constantly messed up. not here, the bongo room nails their perfect hollaindaise sauce. they had a generous hand with the lobster meat too. 

the chocolate tower of french toast would be the next dish i order if i come back. i grabbed a few bites of my friends and fell in love instantly. its not overpowering with sweetness, and the chocolate is real chocolate!"
4,"Up until this last weekend, I was sole Chicagoan left who had not yet been to The Bongo Room. With three locations including one within walking distance of me, I had no excuse left not to give them a try!

When you go to Bongo Room, always expect a wait. We were quoted about 30 minutes so checked in, then grabbed some coffees next door. There are a million fab coffee shops right next to the Wicker Park location so waiting a few minutes is no problem at all.

We were seated at the counter and Jessica took care of us. She was so bubbly &amp; friendly for a Saturday morning! Perfect amount of service to check in on us but also leave us to our chatting. 

I had the BLT Pesto Benedict which was a unique offering and huge portion with a mountain of breakfast potatoes on the side. Loved this $15 dish and would def get it again. My friend had the Cinnamon Pear French Toast which I tried and whoa, was it indulgent and savory but very sweet &amp; tasty.

All in all, wonderful brunch at The Bongo Room and I&apos;d definitely pop in again for some eats."
4,"I went here on a Sunday morning after a weekend in Chicago. We had a party of 11 so we had to split between two tables. The place is fairly small so if you have a big group I would no recommend it. This is nothing against the food though, it was delicious! I got a caprese eggs Benedict with sweet Italian sausage. It was very good and I liked that it was on an English muffin. The potatoes were also good. My only complaint was that there was too much hollandaise sauce. Next time I would just ask for less. Overall I recommend this breakfast spot!"
4,"So far only tried the white chocolate caramel pancakes which were super tasty! I did a call in order so they were settled a bit and I had to heat them up when I made it home. Good topping, good portion, good flavor. Almost $15 after tax for just pancakes though which is a little much especially since you can&apos;t make them a platter but still enjoyed them."
3,"Fun restaurant, definitely need a reservation for brunch, decent food and prices.

I wanted to try a cute, brunch place in Wicker Park and Bongo Room kept showing up. We made a reservation, and thank goodness for that since it was a full house Saturday day. We got seated and I immediate was drawn to their pancakes. They no longer have the red velvet pancakes featured in the yelp photo. I got their pumpkin spice pancakes. Their cakes don&apos;t seem to be recommended with syrup since they come with sauces and creams of their own that the restaurant recommends. I also got a turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Both entrees had a lot of potential but had less flavor than I wanted them to. The server was delightful and the bill didn&apos;t make us cry so I&apos;m writing it off as a good experience but I will continue the hunt for cute, brunch spots."
4,"I had been to a different location Bongo Room in the past and decided to try this one during a visit to Chicago. We went shortly after opening on a Saturday morning so there where still plenty of open tables.

The menu is not too big, with a side dedicated to brunch (Saturdays and Sundays only). We ordered two savory dishes and one individual strawberry and banana pancakes (yes, you can order pancakes individually, though it does not explicitly say so on the menu).

I enjoyed my food, though wish the lobster benedict overall was more hot (temperature-wise). I also bit into a few fragments of lobster shell which was not so fun. The pancake was good but a bit dry and thick.

The interior is nice with an industrial feel. Service was probably the highlight of the meal, with a friendly host and server and waters brought to your table almost immediately after being seated.

Prices are fair and basically what I expected for brunch.

Overall, a solid meal though not quite as memorable as my previous visit.

P.S. The sink in the restroom is really unique, it has the hand dryer integrated into the faucet!"

My husband liked the chorizo, potato and avocado omelette. He just reminded me that he actually likes everything at the bongo room so you can order anything and you will probably love it. Every pancake/French toast is yummy and unique in its own way. We typically order four or five different options then share family style with our kids. We have three children so seating is typically finagled but it always works out and they find us a table for five. The wait seems extra short due to all the fun shops in the area and the service is always prompt once seated."
4,"I feel like the only thing I need to say is that they serve Deconstructed. Lobster Roll. Eggs Benedict. Say it with me! 

This excited me because I&apos;m not used to seeing this type of benedict on any menu, so I took a chance. For $15.95. And it literally is a deconstructed lobster roll with poached eggs and hollandaise. The lobster meat was plentiful, the roll was nicely buttered and soft. The eggs and the hollandaise were just an added bonus. 

Let&apos;s also talk about the potatoes - they were cooked to perfection. Usually I have trouble finishing a side of potatoes because they can get so heavy. But the portion was excellent, and the consistency helped with consumption! Not too starchy. 

A wait is to be expected. According to my cousins, the Bongo Room is pretty popular in these parts. If you&apos;re visiting from out of town and want to try this for a weekend brunch, I suggest you plan your trip a bit early to account for waiting!"
5,"Food was yummy in the tummy.  The wait is long to get a table, but hey, it&apos;s a small space. 

It is noisy and there are loads of people here for breakfast and brunch on the weekends.

Facility is clean, servers are friendly.

The door and entry is not super ADA friendly.

The food was plentiful, flavorful, and rich.  Expect a heavy meal, not light."
5,"come hungry and ready to wait. on a sunday morning around 1030, youre looking at a good hour. leave your name and hit up a bar down the block while you wait. however, let me tell you - its worth every minute. the place is small and crammed, but the staff is great and the service is fast!

the irish coffee hit the spot and grew some hair on my chest. i gulped it down in 2 gulps. priced a bit high, but worth it since it woke me up and got me a nice buzz all in 1.

the lobster roll eggs benedict is a must get. its deconstructed, but a full on mess. the potatoes it comes with are delish too. its filling, and you will eat every last bite off the plate. as simple as it is, hollanidaise sauce its constantly messed up. not here, the bongo room nails their perfect hollaindaise sauce. they had a generous hand with the lobster meat too. 

the chocolate tower of french toast would be the next dish i order if i come back. i grabbed a few bites of my friends and fell in love instantly. its not overpowering with sweetness, and the chocolate is real chocolate!"
4,"Up until this last weekend, I was sole Chicagoan left who had not yet been to The Bongo Room. With three locations including one within walking distance of me, I had no excuse left not to give them a try!

When you go to Bongo Room, always expect a wait. We were quoted about 30 minutes so checked in, then grabbed some coffees next door. There are a million fab coffee shops right next to the Wicker Park location so waiting a few minutes is no problem at all.

We were seated at the counter and Jessica took care of us. She was so bubbly &amp; friendly for a Saturday morning! Perfect amount of service to check in on us but also leave us to our chatting. 

I had the BLT Pesto Benedict which was a unique offering and huge portion with a mountain of breakfast potatoes on the side. Loved this $15 dish and would def get it again. My friend had the Cinnamon Pear French Toast which I tried and whoa, was it indulgent and savory but very sweet &amp; tasty.

All in all, wonderful brunch at The Bongo Room and I&apos;d definitely pop in again for some eats."
4,"I went here on a Sunday morning after a weekend in Chicago. We had a party of 11 so we had to split between two tables. The place is fairly small so if you have a big group I would no recommend it. This is nothing against the food though, it was delicious! I got a caprese eggs Benedict with sweet Italian sausage. It was very good and I liked that it was on an English muffin. The potatoes were also good. My only complaint was that there was too much hollandaise sauce. Next time I would just ask for less. Overall I recommend this breakfast spot!"
4,"So far only tried the white chocolate caramel pancakes which were super tasty! I did a call in order so they were settled a bit and I had to heat them up when I made it home. Good topping, good portion, good flavor. Almost $15 after tax for just pancakes though which is a little much especially since you can&apos;t make them a platter but still enjoyed them."
3,"Fun restaurant, definitely need a reservation for brunch, decent food and prices.

I wanted to try a cute, brunch place in Wicker Park and Bongo Room kept showing up. We made a reservation, and thank goodness for that since it was a full house Saturday day. We got seated and I immediate was drawn to their pancakes. They no longer have the red velvet pancakes featured in the yelp photo. I got their pumpkin spice pancakes. Their cakes don&apos;t seem to be recommended with syrup since they come with sauces and creams of their own that the restaurant recommends. I also got a turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Both entrees had a lot of potential but had less flavor than I wanted them to. The server was delightful and the bill didn&apos;t make us cry so I&apos;m writing it off as a good experience but I will continue the hunt for cute, brunch spots."
4,"I had been to a different location Bongo Room in the past and decided to try this one during a visit to Chicago. We went shortly after opening on a Saturday morning so there where still plenty of open tables.

The menu is not too big, with a side dedicated to brunch (Saturdays and Sundays only). We ordered two savory dishes and one individual strawberry and banana pancakes (yes, you can order pancakes individually, though it does not explicitly say so on the menu).

I enjoyed my food, though wish the lobster benedict overall was more hot (temperature-wise). I also bit into a few fragments of lobster shell which was not so fun. The pancake was good but a bit dry and thick.

The interior is nice with an industrial feel. Service was probably the highlight of the meal, with a friendly host and server and waters brought to your table almost immediately after being seated.

Prices are fair and basically what I expected for brunch.

Overall, a solid meal though not quite as memorable as my previous visit.

P.S. The sink in the restroom is really unique, it has the hand dryer integrated into the faucet!"
2,"I had been wanting to come here for a couple years now, unfortunately just to be disappointed. When we arrived the hostess sat us at a very noticeably dirty table. I assumed she would ask someone to come clean it but she didn&apos;t. The guy that brought over our water and utensils moved us to a different table after noticing how dirty it was. I ordered a breakfast burrito which was supposed to be in a spinach tortilla but it wasn&apos;t, it came in a regular flour tortilla. It wouldn&apos;t have been a big deal if someone would&apos;ve just gave me a heads up but no one said anything. I guess they were hoping I didn&apos;t notice? The flavor was mediocre, definitely nothing to brag about. My son ordered eggs, bacon, house potatoes, and an English muffin. He wasn&apos;t impressed either. I paid $40 for brunch neither one of us particularly enjoyed."
4,"When picture of food from this place on Yelp, from their savory looking dishes to the foods sweet and scrumptiously looking, sugar filled French toast, I knew I had to stop by!

I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was nothing special. I wouldn&apos;t order it again just cause it didn&apos;t leave an impression on be. Also a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little (or a lot) of hot sauce couldn&apos;t fix.

The chocolate tower French toast was absolutely perfect. Very rich and chocolatey but not too sweet.

The service was a little on the slow side. Our glasses were only filled once and it took a lot of effort to get the waiters attention so I had to knock off one star. Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!"
5,I love this place. Might be my new favorite brunch spot. I had the lobster roll Benedict and the chocolate tower French toast. It was mouth watering and very filling. The French toast was very heavy and it&apos;s a big portion so I would recommend sharing it. The best time to go is at 9am right when they open otherwise you&apos;re going to be waiting for a long time but it&apos;s definitely worth the wait. They do not have flavored creamers for the coffee which I would suggest for them to offer. Parking is also tricky in this area but I can&apos;t wait to come back to try more off the menu!
5,"Absolutely delicious brunch. Large portions. Got the croissant sandwich, deconstructed lobster roll, churro french toast and berry lemon pancakes. Every dish was flavorful. Highly recommend. 

Got pickup due to covid. Ordered online and was ready within 20 minutes."
5,Got takeout. It was amazing !!! Not one item I didnt love. And we couldn&apos;t eat it all!
3,"This place was good and good service, but I think my expectations were too high. They have a fun menu but the taste of the dishes themselves was average. For drinks, the coffee was good (just basic drip coffee), as was the chai tea latte. The chai latte was more milky and less spicy than I prefer, but still good. As for dishes, the best was the Apple and Pear Crumble French Toast- very flavorful toppings and fluffy french toast. We also tried the banana praline pancakes which had good flavors but not enough crunch. It almost tasted a bit mushy with all the sauce on it. Lastly, the lobster roll Benedict was tasty but came out cold. I think I would have liked this dish more if the lobster used was more plain (it tasted like tuna salad but with lobster). Overall good place if you&apos;re looking for brunch or breakfast nearby, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily go out of your way to come here."
5,"I love Bongo Room! Such a fun, eclectic brunch spot. I love how fast they change menu&apos;s and incorporate seasonal faire. Out of the many times I&apos;ve eaten here my most favorite meals of all time where Strawberry Banana Pancakes and Red Velvet Cream Cheese Pancakes! Last I checked these menu items are not available ATM but could make a come back! I hope so because everyone deserves to try the SB ones. So yummy and sweet! It&apos;s like eating dessert for breakfast."
4,"Very high quality breakfast options with rich and flavorful options to choose from. I enjoyed the open and airy ambience that was able to accommodate large groups. 

I tried the BLT Benedict and was pleasantly surprised. It had a very nice sauce that complimented the egg yolk and kept the English muffin from leaving the plate too dry. I also appreciated that the portion size was large enough to satisfy my hunger.

One thing I will say I did not like was the space between the booths. I consider myself average size and the booths were so tight to the table I felt a little claustrophobic. I like to feel comfortable when eating, and I had to seriously concentrate to allow that to not center my attention while dining."
4,"Nice cafe, no words. But a lily bit pricey. They offer traditional breakfast options. Tasty omelette, home fries, but a bit crispy. The staff is very attentive. I never saw my glass empty;)"
5,"Bingo room you have my heart. I go here quite often, especially when things are actually open and you can sit down. This is by far my favorite breakfast place ever. My all time favorite is the strawberries and cream French toast. My second favorite- the pretzel pancakes. Yum. Grab a side of bacon and an iced tea and there you have the best breakfast ever. Service here is always pretty fast and I always leave enjoying my meal. I have taken to go as well and pancakes were hot, warm, and just as tasty. I highly recommend."
3,"The food was pretty good, my friend particularly loved her white chocolate pancakes. The restaurant was very busy and told us we could not be seated unless our whole party was ready. One of my friends has a gluten allergy and the server failed to communicate to the chef that the bread from his order should come on a separate plate--however they did remake it at no cost. 

We had a friend who was very late and arrived after we had already started eating. We asked if we could order her food, or food to go. They replied that they do not do to-go food on weekends and that they don&apos;t allow any orders after the first one has been made (Assumedly to stop people from taking too long at a table and keep things moving). They also told us she wouldn&apos;t be allowed to join our table to sit with us while we finished up and that she had to wait outside/in the waiting area.

Some notes:
Wait time was nonexistent at 9 am, it got busy quickly though. The waiting area was very small--just the vestibule with a heat lamp. Booths seated 6. Staff were friendly and polite. Although I wasn&apos;t a fan of the restaurants policies and they gave us a bad experience, I understand why they have them I&apos;m general."

The interior is nice with an industrial feel. Service was probably the highlight of the meal, with a friendly host and server and waters brought to your table almost immediately after being seated.

Prices are fair and basically what I expected for brunch.

Overall, a solid meal though not quite as memorable as my previous visit.

P.S. The sink in the restroom is really unique, it has the hand dryer integrated into the faucet!"
2,"I had been wanting to come here for a couple years now, unfortunately just to be disappointed. When we arrived the hostess sat us at a very noticeably dirty table. I assumed she would ask someone to come clean it but she didn&apos;t. The guy that brought over our water and utensils moved us to a different table after noticing how dirty it was. I ordered a breakfast burrito which was supposed to be in a spinach tortilla but it wasn&apos;t, it came in a regular flour tortilla. It wouldn&apos;t have been a big deal if someone would&apos;ve just gave me a heads up but no one said anything. I guess they were hoping I didn&apos;t notice? The flavor was mediocre, definitely nothing to brag about. My son ordered eggs, bacon, house potatoes, and an English muffin. He wasn&apos;t impressed either. I paid $40 for brunch neither one of us particularly enjoyed."
4,"When picture of food from this place on Yelp, from their savory looking dishes to the foods sweet and scrumptiously looking, sugar filled French toast, I knew I had to stop by!

I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was nothing special. I wouldn&apos;t order it again just cause it didn&apos;t leave an impression on be. Also a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little (or a lot) of hot sauce couldn&apos;t fix.

The chocolate tower French toast was absolutely perfect. Very rich and chocolatey but not too sweet.

The service was a little on the slow side. Our glasses were only filled once and it took a lot of effort to get the waiters attention so I had to knock off one star. Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!"
5,I love this place. Might be my new favorite brunch spot. I had the lobster roll Benedict and the chocolate tower French toast. It was mouth watering and very filling. The French toast was very heavy and it&apos;s a big portion so I would recommend sharing it. The best time to go is at 9am right when they open otherwise you&apos;re going to be waiting for a long time but it&apos;s definitely worth the wait. They do not have flavored creamers for the coffee which I would suggest for them to offer. Parking is also tricky in this area but I can&apos;t wait to come back to try more off the menu!
