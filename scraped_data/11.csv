5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"

I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"

5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"

I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.

We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"

I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate.

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be.

If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food.

Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."

All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."

5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."

The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready.

5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s.

It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.

3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."

Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).

4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"

5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"

I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.

We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"

I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate.

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be.

If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food.

Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."

All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."

5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."

The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready.

5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s.

It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.

3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."

Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).

4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"

5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"

I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.

We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"

I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate.

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be.

If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food.

Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."

All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."

5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."

The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready.

5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s.

It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.

3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."

Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).

4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"

5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"

I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.

We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"

I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate.

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be.

If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food.

Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."

All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."

5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."

The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready.

5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s.

It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.

3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."

Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).

4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"

5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"

I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.

We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"

I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate.

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be.

If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food.

Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."

All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."

5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."

The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready.

5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good! We ordered take-out about a month ago via their website. You can order beer if you want to go as well. 

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."

We approached the host stand outside, who directed us to the building next door to pick up our order. Our order was ready and handed to us through a window. Seamless! 

We got a deep dish w extra sauce and cheese. Added sausage and spinach and mushroom and maybe even pineapple and pepperoni on half? It was intense!"
2,Highly over rated. I&apos;ve seen different media outlets rank them as the best deep dish in Chicago. They are not. Pizza was very bland and they didn&apos;t even cut it.
5,"Pequod&apos;s pizza rightfully gets rave reviews, and there&apos;s not too much I can add to them (besides some advice to order a personal pan pizza for each person so you can maximize that carmelized crust!). The shout out I want to give is for the outstanding pick up experience I had several weeks ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I placed an order through their website, which was super convenient and allowed great ability to customize (e.g. doneness). I requested a specific time for pickup, and got a text when ready. The pickup was at the Whale Tale, a couple doors down from the restaurant - the front window was wide open and served as the pickup window. The employees wore masks (properly, thank you thank you!) and grabbed our pizzas out of a large hotbox quickly. Easy, peasy, and safe. 

Many thanks to Pequod&apos;s for a great setup for takeaway. Being able to have your awesome pizza made our evening!"
5,"We got a Medium deep dish carry out.

Wow, this was delicious. Pequod&apos;s deep dish differs from the other major Chicago chains - Giordano&apos;s, Lou Malnati&apos;s, Nancy&apos;s, etc - in that it doesn&apos;t have a thick layer of cheese. This pie had a greater emphasis on bread than cheese, which was a welcomed discovery.

The slightly burnt crust was perfect. Overall, this is a top notch deep dish pizza. I&apos;ll definitely be back."
4,"Got a small pan pizza with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. I was planning to order for delivery on Saturday for lunch, but accidentally ordered for immediate delivery on a Friday night right before bed. Oops. All good, though I ended up having to put it in the fridge and reheat it the next morning. Was still delicious, though a bit on the soft side. Sausage was yummy and came in huge chunks. Onions were bit on the tiny side, mushrooms rather small as well. Overall though, pretty tasty and will definitely order from here again!"
5,"Chicago has a lot of deep dish pizza options, but of all the places my friend (who lives in Chicago) chose to order from Pequod&apos;s, which in itself is saying a lot. On top of that, in the past when I&apos;ve had deep dish pizza, I&apos;ve always felt overly full and honestly kind of shitty afterwards.. this was not the case after pequods! Their crust wasn&apos;t as heavy and greasy as other deep dish pizza that I&apos;ve had. We got a pizza with sausage, onion, and spinach to split between 3 people, and man it was good.

This Pequod&apos;s has a takeout window (actually they have 2) that made it really easy and covid safe to get food. Additionally, they had our pizza ready exactly when they said they would, and it stayed warm and crunchy for the drive home. If I go back to Chicago I will definitely go back to Pequod&apos;s, hands down."
3,"I&apos;ve been here twice- the first time the pizza was delicious, server was friendly, we had a great time and quick service.

The second time however- our pizza was completely burned, the server barely came to our table, and when we asked about why the pizza was so burned the waitress didn&apos;t care. Also the apps were basically out of a frozen bag and were not good."
1,"Update: after two weeks, I still have not received the promised refund of the item that was left out of my order. Make it right Pequod&apos;s!

After almost two hours of waiting, we received our delivery but instead of the appetizer sampler we ordered, we received an order of cheese bread. I called the store, and the person who answered stated that she was going to contact the driver and see if he had our correct item, and that she would call me back. I ate the pizza we ordered, more on that later, and never heard back from her. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item, which she said she would initiate. 

The pizza tasted okay--good cheese and sauce flavor. The crust was okay, but really burned on the edges. This gave it a bitter flavor, which is unfortunate because normally I&apos;m a crust eater. In reading other reviews, apparently the crust is burned intentionally? Maybe good for some folks but not my jam. 

I&apos;m visiting from out of town, so this will most likely be my first and only experience with Pequod&apos;s."
5,"This place has a intimate setting.

I brought my family here and we were packed into the only big table that I think could handle our crowd.  

Looking at the menu shows lots of varieties and options. 

The staff here were friendly and  very accommodating with my family."
4,"Visiting my sister for the long weekend and she said this was a MUST have for traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

We made reservations ahead of time which I would recommend as there was a line out the door. 

This pizza did not disappoint in terms of being DEEP dish! After 1 piece I was stuffed but of course ate another because it was so good. My only complaint is that they do a special cheese crusted crust on the bottom and ours was a bit overdone/burnt. This made the crust incredibly tough/crunchy and hard to bite through. I&apos;m sure if it was not burnt it would be delicious! 

Very fun hole in the wall/ mom and pop authentic feel!"
5,"I don&apos;t live in Chicago...so I had to get in as much Chicago style pizza as I could during the small amount of time I was in town.  Pequod&apos;s found it&apos;s way onto that list when I checked out the different social media postings and articles on the best in town.

We had heard that lines and waits could be a bit long so we arrived right after they opened.  They checked our temperature and seated us right away.  We got a cool table by the open window to enjoy the nice late morning.  

Being here this early reduces the amount of drinking that can be done...so I just ordered one of the rotating beers, I forgot the name of it.  It came in plastic...which isn&apos;t optimal but covid could be changing how places do things.  Our pizza came out in normal time but while we waited I decided to have the buffalo cauliflower.  It was a nice snack to get me to pizza.  And boy was this pizza good.  So much flavor and yum.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have the space to eat another piece.  I think this could be my favorite Chicago style.  The meats and cheese popped with flavor...nothing bland about this at all.  

When I go back to visit my son, I will definitely be saving room for this pizza as we hit more of the Chicago food scene.

Parking is street parking.  You know the drill."
3,"Not the greatest pizza I&apos;ve ever tried but definitely better than Lou Manaltis. 

We got a large pepperoni pizza. Excited to see it inundated with pepperoni. The cheese was good. The crust was decent."
5,"Worth the hype. I ate a few Chicago style pizza places while in town, and this one takes the win no doubt! It comes out literally bubbling and smelling like cheese paradise. The sausage was in massive pieces but didn&apos;t overpower anything. That burnt cheese that everyone is talking about is not over hyped. It made that pizza! The pies are pricey, that&apos;s because they are massive. I swear this pizza was almost 10lbs. And the leftovers are just as good, so go for the large no matter what. You won&apos;t regret it!"
1,"Pequod&apos;s crap pizza? I have been privileged to have eaten there twice and I ordered via goldbelly. and the crust is 99% with no cheese, no caramelized cheese. just a crappy bread.. someone needs to learn how to make bread or even Italian.. a zero. tasteless, just thousands of calories and carbs with zero taste. 

I understand that shipping across country is difficult, most can&apos;t ship/deliver across town, but pizza crust doesn&apos;t transform into an inedible, gummy, attack on people sheltered because they are suffering with sars-cov-2.

Taking advantage of a global pandemic and sending something cheap an inferior is unforgivable."
5,"Places like this are the reason I use Yelp. In a word, amazing. 

Food 5/5. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with garlic. SO GOOD. Four days later I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. I&apos;ve had deep dish in Chicago before and it always made me feel like crap after. For some reason that didn&apos;t happen with this pie. It&apos;s not super greasy. The crust is soft on the inside and crispy out the outside. 2 slides was the perfect amount for one person (i could&apos;ve had 3 I liked it so much).  For three people we shared a medium and it was perfect. The ambiance was great - brick walls, sports games, and beer. Will totally come back."
4,"Despite all my visits to Chicago, I&apos;d yet to try the pizza Chicago is famous for -- deep dish, or pan pizza as it&apos;s known at the very popular Pequod&apos;s Pizzeria. Fixed that during my last stay in December with a dinner delivery. My daughter and I split the medium pan pizza (12&quot;) and the full Caesar salad. Pequod&apos;s pizza is known for its caramelized crust, achieved by cooking the pizza in a cast iron pan. The pizza is good and very filling. We had loads left for round two the next day. The salad was nice and fresh but we definitely could have used more dressing. Order BEFORE you are hungry. My daughter said they make each pizza to order and deep dish takes a long time to cook.  I&apos;d say ours with us in about 90 minutes, which can happen if the place is busy and just makes you enjoy it all the more."
4,"The crust on this pizza is AMAZING! I wish I could just get the crust. The sauce was also fantastic. We got the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas. I would definitely the pepperoni again. I&apos;d eat the sausage again, but if I were between the 2, I&apos;d definitely pick the pepperoni. The dough to sauce to cheese ratio wasn&apos;t exactly where I&apos;d want it to be. I&apos;d want less dough, and more cheese, but there was the perfect amount of sauce. 

It did take almost 2 hours for them to deliver the pizza to us although we were surprised they delivered to us because we&apos;re on the edge of their delivery radius. That being said the mozzarella sticks were a little cold by the time that we had them. Definitely give it a try!"
2,"The best thing I can say about Pequod&apos;s is that it is not the worst deep dish I&apos;ve had here in Chicago. (Obviously as New Yorker I&apos;d never call any of this trash, &quot;pizza&quot;) 

The crumbly crust here is more like a bland crouton, next goes a sort of lack luster sauce and cheese, with your toppings of choice of course. 

The meatballs were decent and the garlic was definitely prevalent; I couldn&apos;t taste olive or much else in this pretty pictured pizza.

All in all I had high hopes going in to this experience but in retrospect I wouldn&apos;t call Pequods much of an experience at all.

From your big crappy chains like Lou Malnati&apos;s, Giordanos, to smaller guys like here at Pequod&apos;s, I almost feel like I&apos;d rather have freezer section pies at a fraction of the cost, at least I&apos;d get some flavor and satisfaction.

We were all severely let down by this spot but I should probably give an extra star just because Shitcago deep dish starts at a severe disadvantage and needs handicap... then again, they just don&apos;t deserve it.

So after &quot;researching&quot; over my past 4-5 Chicago trips my final comparisons for Pequod&apos;s are: 
* The crust is better than Lou Malnatis (but who&apos;s isn&apos;t?) 
* it&apos;s a toss up if they are much better than giordanos.... 
* Gino&apos;s East is way better and most likely all other Chicago pizza is straight garbage  (prove me wrong... this is one instance I&apos;d love to find out how wrong I am with an actual good version of what Chicago seems pizza)"
3,"I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave it a try and it was too much bread for me because it&apos;s a 1 inch bread with not much sauce and cheese and big pieces of Italian sausage and pepperoni. The thin crust pizza was not as flavorful, we got a small with spinach, mushrooms, green pepper and olives. We picked it up and it was an easy pick up but I wish they would double wrap the pan pizza because it was dripping grease and I got it all over my shirt as I walked to the car."
5,"a visit to Chicago wouldn&apos;t have been complete without a trip to Pequod&apos;s. 

Ordered the 14 inch deep dish and it was perfect. Enjoyed it with my son. His friend and my wife and I and had lots of leftovers. 

This deep dish is delicious and full of flavor. 

Enjoy!"
