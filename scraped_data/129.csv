5,"This is a wonderful healthy carry out/pick-up option. I tried one of the Wok out bowls with quinoa and my husband had a burger. Both were ready quickly, great portion sizes, and delicious. We&apos;re so glad the location on Grand is open for pick up!"
5,"So glad to see restaurants are open for business in this pandemic. Courtney, our server, was polite and attentive and delivered delicious food that was ready quickly. My daughter devoured the Veggie Burger while I enjoyed the Quinoa Salad and we split the Sweet Potato Fries. All-in-all, it was a wonderful dining experience in difficult times. If you find yourself in the River North neighborhood of Chicago, stop by this this gem."
5,"Their menu selection and food quality is amazing.  Dining in is definitely a 5 star experience,  carry out is a bit messier but always top notch quality"
5,"Great food, portions, music, good drink selection. 
Cajun chicken sandwich with fries, one of the better chicken sandwiches I&apos;ve had
Ask for the garlic aioli"
4,"This spot is awesomeness located off of the Magnificent Mile, which makes for great views for those who like to people watch. It has a pretty laid back atmosphere meaning no bells and whistles here but you don&apos;t need that when they&apos;ve got great food and drinks!
I played it safe as it was my first time here and ordered the Chicken Sandwich with a side of Candied Bacon! Now that I&apos;m thinking about it, I should&apos;ve put a strip or two of the bacon on the sandwich.. Guess I&apos;ll have to go back and try that!
I totally don&apos;t mind doing so since Doc B&apos;s has such a creative food and drink menu. I ordered some type of Hibiscus drink which was light and refreshing. 
Overall, this is always a place to go when you don&apos;t know where else to go! You can&apos;t go wrong with Doc B&apos;s."
4,"My sister and I stopped here for lunch. The casual environment was great and the COVID precautions they took were decent. They even gave us our on bottle of hand sanitizer for our table.

The steak sandwich and steak we ordered were a little over cooked. We also had the Internal Affair cocktail and it was soooooo good. I slammed two of them, if it was the summer I would have pounded at least 3 more. It&apos;s a great lunch/casual spot!"
3,"Felt somewhat disappointed with this one but felt mislead by the outstanding Yelp reviews. Given the location I did prepare myself for a bit of a tourist trap with mediocre food and Doc B&apos;s is exactly that. 

Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich after scrolling through the Yelp page and being persuaded by picture after picture of the sandwich. MEH. Bun lacked some major moisture and the chicken lacked crisp. The sweet potato fries were oddly large cut and undercooked.  Overall, not a meal I would return for.

Service was good and they had hand sanitizer available at the table, which I appreciated."
4,"Ordered delivery through the yelp app and my dinner arrived within an hour, nicely packaged, with no issues. I got the veggie burger, which was really good - a unique blend of quinoa, black bean, and veggies plus the kale slaw on top was a nice touch. All the burger items on the menu come with a choice of side and this time I went with the sweet potato fries, but next time I&apos;d select something else (thick cut style just wasn&apos;t for me). 
Overall, I still really enjoyed my meal and would recommend as a good delivery option. While a little more ($$) than I&apos;d usually spend, I&apos;m happy to help safely support Chicago businesses during the pandemic."
4,"This review is written in memory of the fruit fly that kamikaze&apos;d into my husband&apos;s beer. May it rest in peace.

We ordered two items tonight, the brussel sprout salad with steak and the ledge burger. Both were DELICIOUS.  The burger was juicy and packed with flavor. The fries that came with the burger was perfect! We might go back just for more fries. The salad was also crisp and flavorful, and the steak was so good it melted in my mouth. It was weird though, that the steak was hidden inside my salad. For a second there, I thought the steak was forgotten! While digging around for it added a fun element, it also would have been nice to be see how much steak came with the salad. The food overall though, was very delicious all around. Oh and one odd compliment- the water here is so delicious! It tasted so clean and was very cold even without ice. I do appreciate a restaurant with great quality water!

The experience wasn&apos;t perfect though, because of the cleanliness factor. Even though we sat inside, fruit flies were every where and there were some food crumbs on the seats. The food made up for it though!"
4,"I&apos;ve found the quality of food here to be mostly great. We&apos;ve ordered takeout thrice, and, with a couple of notable exceptions, everything was excellent. I especially like their salads, which are thoughtfully put together and feature homemade dressings. My husband really likes the cucumber salad, although it was better the first time he tried it; it tasted like it had been sitting around too long the second time. We will skip both the fried chicken and the coleslaw from here on out. My years living in the south have spoiled me for truly remarkable fried chicken, and I&apos;ve found no counterpart here. Theirs is under seasoned and just not up to par. The coleslaw was decidedly sweet and had too much mayonnaise; with this much sugar, it needs the balancing factor that vinegar supplies. These have been rare blips, however, so 4 stars it is. The rather sizable and varied menu means that returns here don&apos;t get too one note."
3,"They have great burgers, sandwiches, and salads. The sweet potato fries are exceptional. The California Salad is delicious. The turkey burger was pretty good. I&apos;ve also tried the wok out bowl - it was pretty good, but a bit oily. I like how you can add whatever you want to it (choose your base, choose your protein, choose your sauce). I got mine with salmon, quinoa, and teriyaki sauce. The salmon was excellent and very well cooked. My friend always orders the crispy chicken sandwich and loves it. 

Can usually get a reservation not too far in advance, but the Gold Coast location can get VERY crowded on Fridays/Saturdays. Wouldn&apos;t say this is a super healthy place like it is advertised but could be worse."
5,"Like Ferris Bueller once said, there are &apos;4,000 restaurants in downtown Chicago&apos;, so you have plenty of choices. And given that this great city is known for its skill with beef, Doc B&apos;s is a fantastic choice should you crave that which once went &apos;moo&apos;, in burger form or otherwise.

With the wind whipping down Rush Street, we knew we needed a respite from the cold. Doc B&apos;s is done with minimalist decor and some relatively dim lighting, but it fits perfectly in the downtown bar &amp; dining scene. We snared a streetside window table and watched the city bustle by and checked out that menu.

Our server, Brandon, made my love&apos;s day by announcing that the house soup was matzo ball, so we had to have some of that. I&apos;m just learning those ways to make a Jewish woman smile, and this happens to be one of said ways! The broth was soooo rich and delish, with the matzo formed just right, though the veggie representation was a tad bit shy (carrots only?). But that soup did its job, warming from the soul outwards.

I went with the Backyard - burg, grilled Canadian bacon, an onion ring that had a short lifespan, BBQ, and shredded cheddar that they clearly meant for six people. It was simply fabulous all put together. My partner went a touch healthier (snicker) with the Napa, pretty much just for the arugula and avocado, but it&apos;s still red meat, yo? Sidled up next to sweet potato fries, she was very happy.

Pricing is fairly Loop standard, meaning ya ain&apos;t getting out without dropping a Jackson or more, but it is completely worth it. Great service, warm environment, a great bar selection, and of course, fabulous food garners Doc B all of my stars to give."
5,"Awesome. Loved the menu. Loved the food. Loved the service. Great down to earth all American menu with something for everyone. I had a turkey burger in a lettuce bun with coleslaw and it was fantastic. This is going to sound weird but i loved the ice that was served in my ice tea. So refreshing. Husband enjoyed wok bowl but agreed wrong order for this type of place. Menu is inviting and there were 10 things I easily could have picked. Can&apos;t wait to go back. 
Edited to add- I went again tonight to this restaurant with my 11 year old who loved his burger and sweet potato fries. I ordered the &quot; number 1 tuna salad&quot; which might be the best salad I&apos;ve had in my lifetime ( ok tied with the seafood salad from falstroms ). I&apos;m convinced after my second visit that this has to be the best casual American restaurant in this town."
4,"This was my first time visiting this chain. Made reservations via OpenTable and strolled over during the dinner hour. Stepped through the maze of doors (for those really cold months ahead to attempt to keep that wind out) to the host. We were immediately led to a booth. Ambiance is casual, loud and lively. 

Decided to start with one of their cocktails: Crazy Beautiful (Straight Up)
Vodka, Voveti, elderflower &amp; spiced pear. Strong and not too sweet.

What I was really craving was a burger. I went with: Wedge Burger of Danish Blue, Sesame Seed Bun, Sunny-side up egg, candied bacon, lettuce &amp; tomato with roasted garlic dressing.  Was it worth the $18? Yes. Delicious and exactly what I was looking for. Served with French fries (or sweet potato fries, coleslaw, or quinoa) that I ate a few more than usual. Had no room for dessert. 

Server was friendly and attentive. A filling dinner after a long day of traveling."
1,"I&apos;ve been doordashing for a while now. I come in here and the staff is usually super polite. I went in the night of 2/2/21 and the order was taking a bit so I hung around. There was a new lady there, older, wearing a skirt. She was SCREAMING at the employees. It was one after another after another. There was cooks, a girl with her hair up who is usually at the front desk, and some other employees I don&apos;t remember. Honestly if I was a customer I would have demanded her manager (assuming she was one). It took everything in my power not to speak up. The tip of the iceburg was hearing her talk badly about the customers as she walked by me. I have ears. 0/5 do not recommend going here. Management displays unprofessionalism."
2,"This was a Rough Experience, with Gross Seats, and Mediocre Food.

We asked for a booth and when presented the booth, the bench was disgusting--take a look at the picture. It&apos;s not like it was just dirty, it that it&apos;s gotten worse and worse over time and no one seems to care. I mentioned it to the staff and manager and only hope that it has been cleaned or reupholstered.

I ordered the Cajun Chicken Club ($17), a fried chicken breast with Monterey Jack, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and dijon honey, tucked in a pretzel bun, and served with fries. It was pathetic--a thin, sad breast of chicken with little-to-no toppings, flavor, or satiation. My date ordered the Wok Out Bowl with Tuna ($23) and sticky brown rice and a sweet and spicy Thai sauce, served with market veggies and chopped cashews. She was underwhelmed as well, as the bowl had little-to-no flavors and just seemed phoned in. Our kids ordered the cheeseburger and fries which my date and I both coveted and wished we ordered.

Kind of surprised this place got such high reviews, seeing Chicago is such a foodie town and folks would have a more discerning palette."
5,"Ribs were amazing, the baked potato was the size of my head, and I&apos;m still salivating over the number six sandwich. Would equate it to a Bandera, but better (not as salty)!"
5,Very good food!! I think the burgers are overpriced but they are very good and they are massive. I like the Matzo ball soup and the chili too. The service is great. They have happy hour
5,"We thought this place was fabulous! We randomly picked it because my dad is is a Doctor B lol and it turned out to be a great choice. Definitely make a reservation for dinner. We did it right through Yelp. The sweet potato fries are great! Very thick cut which I like. I got the shrimp salad and fries, my dad got ribs and ate the whole taco, and my mom got a chicken wok bowl. Then we split chocolate cake which was moist and not too rich."
2,"We ordered a steak frites, the chicken satay, a coke, and Oreo balls. The food all came cold, we got no utensils or napkins with our steak and we were in a hotel that also could not offer us utensils due to COVID, so we essentially couldn&apos;t even eat our steak. Not to mention our Oreo balls also didn&apos;t come OR the drink. When I called and complained about the order, and our inability to eat our food, the staff was short, and said &quot;thanks have a good one&quot; and hung up on me before I was even finished speaking to her. 
Chicken satay and peanut sauce was good just wish it hadn&apos;t come cold. 
Will be looking else where next time I order."

Our server, Brandon, made my love&apos;s day by announcing that the house soup was matzo ball, so we had to have some of that. I&apos;m just learning those ways to make a Jewish woman smile, and this happens to be one of said ways! The broth was soooo rich and delish, with the matzo formed just right, though the veggie representation was a tad bit shy (carrots only?). But that soup did its job, warming from the soul outwards.

I went with the Backyard - burg, grilled Canadian bacon, an onion ring that had a short lifespan, BBQ, and shredded cheddar that they clearly meant for six people. It was simply fabulous all put together. My partner went a touch healthier (snicker) with the Napa, pretty much just for the arugula and avocado, but it&apos;s still red meat, yo? Sidled up next to sweet potato fries, she was very happy.

Pricing is fairly Loop standard, meaning ya ain&apos;t getting out without dropping a Jackson or more, but it is completely worth it. Great service, warm environment, a great bar selection, and of course, fabulous food garners Doc B all of my stars to give."
5,"Awesome. Loved the menu. Loved the food. Loved the service. Great down to earth all American menu with something for everyone. I had a turkey burger in a lettuce bun with coleslaw and it was fantastic. This is going to sound weird but i loved the ice that was served in my ice tea. So refreshing. Husband enjoyed wok bowl but agreed wrong order for this type of place. Menu is inviting and there were 10 things I easily could have picked. Can&apos;t wait to go back. 
Edited to add- I went again tonight to this restaurant with my 11 year old who loved his burger and sweet potato fries. I ordered the &quot; number 1 tuna salad&quot; which might be the best salad I&apos;ve had in my lifetime ( ok tied with the seafood salad from falstroms ). I&apos;m convinced after my second visit that this has to be the best casual American restaurant in this town."
4,"This was my first time visiting this chain. Made reservations via OpenTable and strolled over during the dinner hour. Stepped through the maze of doors (for those really cold months ahead to attempt to keep that wind out) to the host. We were immediately led to a booth. Ambiance is casual, loud and lively. 

Decided to start with one of their cocktails: Crazy Beautiful (Straight Up)
Vodka, Voveti, elderflower &amp; spiced pear. Strong and not too sweet.

What I was really craving was a burger. I went with: Wedge Burger of Danish Blue, Sesame Seed Bun, Sunny-side up egg, candied bacon, lettuce &amp; tomato with roasted garlic dressing.  Was it worth the $18? Yes. Delicious and exactly what I was looking for. Served with French fries (or sweet potato fries, coleslaw, or quinoa) that I ate a few more than usual. Had no room for dessert. 

Server was friendly and attentive. A filling dinner after a long day of traveling."
1,"I&apos;ve been doordashing for a while now. I come in here and the staff is usually super polite. I went in the night of 2/2/21 and the order was taking a bit so I hung around. There was a new lady there, older, wearing a skirt. She was SCREAMING at the employees. It was one after another after another. There was cooks, a girl with her hair up who is usually at the front desk, and some other employees I don&apos;t remember. Honestly if I was a customer I would have demanded her manager (assuming she was one). It took everything in my power not to speak up. The tip of the iceburg was hearing her talk badly about the customers as she walked by me. I have ears. 0/5 do not recommend going here. Management displays unprofessionalism."
2,"This was a Rough Experience, with Gross Seats, and Mediocre Food.

We asked for a booth and when presented the booth, the bench was disgusting--take a look at the picture. It&apos;s not like it was just dirty, it that it&apos;s gotten worse and worse over time and no one seems to care. I mentioned it to the staff and manager and only hope that it has been cleaned or reupholstered.

I ordered the Cajun Chicken Club ($17), a fried chicken breast with Monterey Jack, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and dijon honey, tucked in a pretzel bun, and served with fries. It was pathetic--a thin, sad breast of chicken with little-to-no toppings, flavor, or satiation. My date ordered the Wok Out Bowl with Tuna ($23) and sticky brown rice and a sweet and spicy Thai sauce, served with market veggies and chopped cashews. She was underwhelmed as well, as the bowl had little-to-no flavors and just seemed phoned in. Our kids ordered the cheeseburger and fries which my date and I both coveted and wished we ordered.

Kind of surprised this place got such high reviews, seeing Chicago is such a foodie town and folks would have a more discerning palette."
5,"Ribs were amazing, the baked potato was the size of my head, and I&apos;m still salivating over the number six sandwich. Would equate it to a Bandera, but better (not as salty)!"
5,Very good food!! I think the burgers are overpriced but they are very good and they are massive. I like the Matzo ball soup and the chili too. The service is great. They have happy hour
5,"We thought this place was fabulous! We randomly picked it because my dad is is a Doctor B lol and it turned out to be a great choice. Definitely make a reservation for dinner. We did it right through Yelp. The sweet potato fries are great! Very thick cut which I like. I got the shrimp salad and fries, my dad got ribs and ate the whole taco, and my mom got a chicken wok bowl. Then we split chocolate cake which was moist and not too rich."
2,"We ordered a steak frites, the chicken satay, a coke, and Oreo balls. The food all came cold, we got no utensils or napkins with our steak and we were in a hotel that also could not offer us utensils due to COVID, so we essentially couldn&apos;t even eat our steak. Not to mention our Oreo balls also didn&apos;t come OR the drink. When I called and complained about the order, and our inability to eat our food, the staff was short, and said &quot;thanks have a good one&quot; and hung up on me before I was even finished speaking to her. 
Chicken satay and peanut sauce was good just wish it hadn&apos;t come cold. 
Will be looking else where next time I order."
5,"This is a wonderful healthy carry out/pick-up option. I tried one of the Wok out bowls with quinoa and my husband had a burger. Both were ready quickly, great portion sizes, and delicious. We&apos;re so glad the location on Grand is open for pick up!"
5,"So glad to see restaurants are open for business in this pandemic. Courtney, our server, was polite and attentive and delivered delicious food that was ready quickly. My daughter devoured the Veggie Burger while I enjoyed the Quinoa Salad and we split the Sweet Potato Fries. All-in-all, it was a wonderful dining experience in difficult times. If you find yourself in the River North neighborhood of Chicago, stop by this this gem."
5,"Their menu selection and food quality is amazing.  Dining in is definitely a 5 star experience,  carry out is a bit messier but always top notch quality"
5,"Great food, portions, music, good drink selection. 
Cajun chicken sandwich with fries, one of the better chicken sandwiches I&apos;ve had
Ask for the garlic aioli"
4,"This spot is awesomeness located off of the Magnificent Mile, which makes for great views for those who like to people watch. It has a pretty laid back atmosphere meaning no bells and whistles here but you don&apos;t need that when they&apos;ve got great food and drinks!
I played it safe as it was my first time here and ordered the Chicken Sandwich with a side of Candied Bacon! Now that I&apos;m thinking about it, I should&apos;ve put a strip or two of the bacon on the sandwich.. Guess I&apos;ll have to go back and try that!
I totally don&apos;t mind doing so since Doc B&apos;s has such a creative food and drink menu. I ordered some type of Hibiscus drink which was light and refreshing. 
Overall, this is always a place to go when you don&apos;t know where else to go! You can&apos;t go wrong with Doc B&apos;s."
4,"My sister and I stopped here for lunch. The casual environment was great and the COVID precautions they took were decent. They even gave us our on bottle of hand sanitizer for our table.

The steak sandwich and steak we ordered were a little over cooked. We also had the Internal Affair cocktail and it was soooooo good. I slammed two of them, if it was the summer I would have pounded at least 3 more. It&apos;s a great lunch/casual spot!"
3,"Felt somewhat disappointed with this one but felt mislead by the outstanding Yelp reviews. Given the location I did prepare myself for a bit of a tourist trap with mediocre food and Doc B&apos;s is exactly that. 

Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich after scrolling through the Yelp page and being persuaded by picture after picture of the sandwich. MEH. Bun lacked some major moisture and the chicken lacked crisp. The sweet potato fries were oddly large cut and undercooked.  Overall, not a meal I would return for.

Service was good and they had hand sanitizer available at the table, which I appreciated."
4,"Ordered delivery through the yelp app and my dinner arrived within an hour, nicely packaged, with no issues. I got the veggie burger, which was really good - a unique blend of quinoa, black bean, and veggies plus the kale slaw on top was a nice touch. All the burger items on the menu come with a choice of side and this time I went with the sweet potato fries, but next time I&apos;d select something else (thick cut style just wasn&apos;t for me). 
Overall, I still really enjoyed my meal and would recommend as a good delivery option. While a little more ($$) than I&apos;d usually spend, I&apos;m happy to help safely support Chicago businesses during the pandemic."
4,"This review is written in memory of the fruit fly that kamikaze&apos;d into my husband&apos;s beer. May it rest in peace.

We ordered two items tonight, the brussel sprout salad with steak and the ledge burger. Both were DELICIOUS.  The burger was juicy and packed with flavor. The fries that came with the burger was perfect! We might go back just for more fries. The salad was also crisp and flavorful, and the steak was so good it melted in my mouth. It was weird though, that the steak was hidden inside my salad. For a second there, I thought the steak was forgotten! While digging around for it added a fun element, it also would have been nice to be see how much steak came with the salad. The food overall though, was very delicious all around. Oh and one odd compliment- the water here is so delicious! It tasted so clean and was very cold even without ice. I do appreciate a restaurant with great quality water!

The experience wasn&apos;t perfect though, because of the cleanliness factor. Even though we sat inside, fruit flies were every where and there were some food crumbs on the seats. The food made up for it though!"
4,"I&apos;ve found the quality of food here to be mostly great. We&apos;ve ordered takeout thrice, and, with a couple of notable exceptions, everything was excellent. I especially like their salads, which are thoughtfully put together and feature homemade dressings. My husband really likes the cucumber salad, although it was better the first time he tried it; it tasted like it had been sitting around too long the second time. We will skip both the fried chicken and the coleslaw from here on out. My years living in the south have spoiled me for truly remarkable fried chicken, and I&apos;ve found no counterpart here. Theirs is under seasoned and just not up to par. The coleslaw was decidedly sweet and had too much mayonnaise; with this much sugar, it needs the balancing factor that vinegar supplies. These have been rare blips, however, so 4 stars it is. The rather sizable and varied menu means that returns here don&apos;t get too one note."
3,"They have great burgers, sandwiches, and salads. The sweet potato fries are exceptional. The California Salad is delicious. The turkey burger was pretty good. I&apos;ve also tried the wok out bowl - it was pretty good, but a bit oily. I like how you can add whatever you want to it (choose your base, choose your protein, choose your sauce). I got mine with salmon, quinoa, and teriyaki sauce. The salmon was excellent and very well cooked. My friend always orders the crispy chicken sandwich and loves it. 

Can usually get a reservation not too far in advance, but the Gold Coast location can get VERY crowded on Fridays/Saturdays. Wouldn&apos;t say this is a super healthy place like it is advertised but could be worse."
5,"Like Ferris Bueller once said, there are &apos;4,000 restaurants in downtown Chicago&apos;, so you have plenty of choices. And given that this great city is known for its skill with beef, Doc B&apos;s is a fantastic choice should you crave that which once went &apos;moo&apos;, in burger form or otherwise.

With the wind whipping down Rush Street, we knew we needed a respite from the cold. Doc B&apos;s is done with minimalist decor and some relatively dim lighting, but it fits perfectly in the downtown bar &amp; dining scene. We snared a streetside window table and watched the city bustle by and checked out that menu.

Our server, Brandon, made my love&apos;s day by announcing that the house soup was matzo ball, so we had to have some of that. I&apos;m just learning those ways to make a Jewish woman smile, and this happens to be one of said ways! The broth was soooo rich and delish, with the matzo formed just right, though the veggie representation was a tad bit shy (carrots only?). But that soup did its job, warming from the soul outwards.

I went with the Backyard - burg, grilled Canadian bacon, an onion ring that had a short lifespan, BBQ, and shredded cheddar that they clearly meant for six people. It was simply fabulous all put together. My partner went a touch healthier (snicker) with the Napa, pretty much just for the arugula and avocado, but it&apos;s still red meat, yo? Sidled up next to sweet potato fries, she was very happy.

Pricing is fairly Loop standard, meaning ya ain&apos;t getting out without dropping a Jackson or more, but it is completely worth it. Great service, warm environment, a great bar selection, and of course, fabulous food garners Doc B all of my stars to give."

Cajun chicken sandwich with fries, one of the better chicken sandwiches I&apos;ve had
Ask for the garlic aioli"
4,"This spot is awesomeness located off of the Magnificent Mile, which makes for great views for those who like to people watch. It has a pretty laid back atmosphere meaning no bells and whistles here but you don&apos;t need that when they&apos;ve got great food and drinks!
I played it safe as it was my first time here and ordered the Chicken Sandwich with a side of Candied Bacon! Now that I&apos;m thinking about it, I should&apos;ve put a strip or two of the bacon on the sandwich.. Guess I&apos;ll have to go back and try that!
I totally don&apos;t mind doing so since Doc B&apos;s has such a creative food and drink menu. I ordered some type of Hibiscus drink which was light and refreshing. 
Overall, this is always a place to go when you don&apos;t know where else to go! You can&apos;t go wrong with Doc B&apos;s."
4,"My sister and I stopped here for lunch. The casual environment was great and the COVID precautions they took were decent. They even gave us our on bottle of hand sanitizer for our table.

3,"Felt somewhat disappointed with this one but felt mislead by the outstanding Yelp reviews. Given the location I did prepare myself for a bit of a tourist trap with mediocre food and Doc B&apos;s is exactly that.

Bun lacked some major moisture and the chicken lacked crisp. The sweet potato fries were oddly large cut and undercooked.  Overall, not a meal I would return for.

Service was good and they had hand sanitizer available at the table, which I appreciated."
4,"Ordered delivery through the yelp app and my dinner arrived within an hour, nicely packaged, with no issues. I got the veggie burger, which was really good - a unique blend of quinoa, black bean, and veggies plus the kale slaw on top was a nice touch. All the burger items on the menu come with a choice of side and this time I went with the sweet potato fries, but next time I&apos;d select something else (thick cut style just wasn&apos;t for me). 
Overall, I still really enjoyed my meal and would recommend as a good delivery option. While a little more ($$) than I&apos;d usually spend, I&apos;m happy to help safely support Chicago businesses during the pandemic."
4,"This review is written in memory of the fruit fly that kamikaze&apos;d into my husband&apos;s beer. May it rest in peace.

We ordered two items tonight, the brussel sprout salad with steak and the ledge burger. Both were DELICIOUS.  The burger was juicy and packed with flavor. The fries that came with the burger was perfect! We might go back just for more fries. The salad was also crisp and flavorful, and the steak was so good it melted in my mouth. It was weird though, that the steak was hidden inside my salad. For a second there, I thought the steak was forgotten! While digging around for it added a fun element, it also would have been nice to be see how much steak came with the salad. The food overall though, was very delicious all around. Oh and one odd compliment- the water here is so delicious! It tasted so clean and was very cold even without ice. I do appreciate a restaurant with great quality water!

The experience wasn&apos;t perfect though, because of the cleanliness factor. Even though we sat inside, fruit flies were every where and there were some food crumbs on the seats. The food made up for it though!"
4,"I&apos;ve found the quality of food here to be mostly great. We&apos;ve ordered takeout thrice, and, with a couple of notable exceptions, everything was excellent. I especially like their salads, which are thoughtfully put together and feature homemade dressings. My husband really likes the cucumber salad, although it was better the first time he tried it; it tasted like it had been sitting around too long the second time. We will skip both the fried chicken and the coleslaw from here on out. My years living in the south have spoiled me for truly remarkable fried chicken, and I&apos;ve found no counterpart here. Theirs is under seasoned and just not up to par. The coleslaw was decidedly sweet and had too much mayonnaise; with this much sugar, it needs the balancing factor that vinegar supplies. These have been rare blips, however, so 4 stars it is. The rather sizable and varied menu means that returns here don&apos;t get too one note."
3,"They have great burgers, sandwiches, and salads. The sweet potato fries are exceptional. The California Salad is delicious. The turkey burger was pretty good.

Can usually get a reservation not too far in advance, but the Gold Coast location can get VERY crowded on Fridays/Saturdays. Wouldn&apos;t say this is a super healthy place like it is advertised but could be worse."
5,"Like Ferris Bueller once said, there are &apos;4,000 restaurants in downtown Chicago&apos;, so you have plenty of choices. And given that this great city is known for its skill with beef, Doc B&apos;s is a fantastic choice should you crave that which once went &apos;moo&apos;, in burger form or otherwise.

With the wind whipping down Rush Street, we knew we needed a respite from the cold. Doc B&apos;s is done with minimalist decor and some relatively dim lighting, but it fits perfectly in the downtown bar &amp; dining scene. We snared a streetside window table and watched the city bustle by and checked out that menu.

Our server, Brandon, made my love&apos;s day by announcing that the house soup was matzo ball, so we had to have some of that. I&apos;m just learning those ways to make a Jewish woman smile, and this happens to be one of said ways! The broth was soooo rich and delish, with the matzo formed just right, though the veggie representation was a tad bit shy (carrots only?). But that soup did its job, warming from the soul outwards.

I went with the Backyard - burg, grilled Canadian bacon, an onion ring that had a short lifespan, BBQ, and shredded cheddar that they clearly meant for six people. It was simply fabulous all put together. My partner went a touch healthier (snicker) with the Napa, pretty much just for the arugula and avocado, but it&apos;s still red meat, yo? Sidled up next to sweet potato fries, she was very happy.

Pricing is fairly Loop standard, meaning ya ain&apos;t getting out without dropping a Jackson or more, but it is completely worth it. Great service, warm environment, a great bar selection, and of course, fabulous food garners Doc B all of my stars to give."
5,"Awesome. Loved the menu. Loved the food. Loved the service. Great down to earth all American menu with something for everyone. I had a turkey burger in a lettuce bun with coleslaw and it was fantastic. This is going to sound weird but i loved the ice that was served in my ice tea. So refreshing. Husband enjoyed wok bowl but agreed wrong order for this type of place. Menu is inviting and there were 10 things I easily could have picked. Can&apos;t wait to go back. 
Edited to add- I went again tonight to this restaurant with my 11 year old who loved his burger and sweet potato fries. I ordered the &quot; number 1 tuna salad&quot; which might be the best salad I&apos;ve had in my lifetime ( ok tied with the seafood salad from falstroms ). I&apos;m convinced after my second visit that this has to be the best casual American restaurant in this town."
4,"This was my first time visiting this chain. Made reservations via OpenTable and strolled over during the dinner hour. Stepped through the maze of doors (for those really cold months ahead to attempt to keep that wind out) to the host. We were immediately led to a booth. Ambiance is casual, loud and lively. 

Decided to start with one of their cocktails: Crazy Beautiful (Straight Up)
Vodka, Voveti, elderflower &amp; spiced pear. Strong and not too sweet.

What I was really craving was a burger. I went with: Wedge Burger of Danish Blue, Sesame Seed Bun, Sunny-side up egg, candied bacon, lettuce &amp; tomato with roasted garlic dressing.  Was it worth the $18? Yes. Delicious and exactly what I was looking for. Served with French fries (or sweet potato fries, coleslaw, or quinoa) that I ate a few more than usual. Had no room for dessert. 

Server was friendly and attentive. A filling dinner after a long day of traveling."
1,"I&apos;ve been doordashing for a while now. I come in here and the staff is usually super polite. I went in the night of 2/2/21 and the order was taking a bit so I hung around. There was a new lady there, older, wearing a skirt. She was SCREAMING at the employees. It was one after another after another. There was cooks, a girl with her hair up who is usually at the front desk, and some other employees I don&apos;t remember. Honestly if I was a customer I would have demanded her manager (assuming she was one). It took everything in my power not to speak up. The tip of the iceburg was hearing her talk badly about the customers as she walked by me. I have ears. 0/5 do not recommend going here. Management displays unprofessionalism."
2,"This was a Rough Experience, with Gross Seats, and Mediocre Food.

We asked for a booth and when presented the booth, the bench was disgusting--take a look at the picture. It&apos;s not like it was just dirty, it that it&apos;s gotten worse and worse over time and no one seems to care. I mentioned it to the staff and manager and only hope that it has been cleaned or reupholstered.

I ordered the Cajun Chicken Club ($17), a fried chicken breast with Monterey Jack, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and dijon honey, tucked in a pretzel bun, and served with fries. It was pathetic--a thin, sad breast of chicken with little-to-no toppings, flavor, or satiation. My date ordered the Wok Out Bowl with Tuna ($23) and sticky brown rice and a sweet and spicy Thai sauce, served with market veggies and chopped cashews. She was underwhelmed as well, as the bowl had little-to-no flavors and just seemed phoned in. Our kids ordered the cheeseburger and fries which my date and I both coveted and wished we ordered.

Kind of surprised this place got such high reviews, seeing Chicago is such a foodie town and folks would have a more discerning palette."
5,"Ribs were amazing, the baked potato was the size of my head, and I&apos;m still salivating over the number six sandwich. Would equate it to a Bandera, but better (not as salty)!"
5,Very good food!! I think the burgers are overpriced but they are very good and they are massive. I like the Matzo ball soup and the chili too. The service is great. They have happy hour
5,"We thought this place was fabulous! We randomly picked it because my dad is is a Doctor B lol and it turned out to be a great choice. Definitely make a reservation for dinner. We did it right through Yelp. The sweet potato fries are great! Very thick cut which I like. I got the shrimp salad and fries, my dad got ribs and ate the whole taco, and my mom got a chicken wok bowl. Then we split chocolate cake which was moist and not too rich."
2,"We ordered a steak frites, the chicken satay, a coke, and Oreo balls. The food all came cold, we got no utensils or napkins with our steak and we were in a hotel that also could not offer us utensils due to COVID, so we essentially couldn&apos;t even eat our steak. Not to mention our Oreo balls also didn&apos;t come OR the drink. When I called and complained about the order, and our inability to eat our food, the staff was short, and said &quot;thanks have a good one&quot; and hung up on me before I was even finished speaking to her. 
Chicken satay and peanut sauce was good just wish it hadn&apos;t come cold.

Doc B&apos;s is done with minimalist decor and some relatively dim lighting, but it fits perfectly in the downtown bar &amp; dining scene. We snared a streetside window table and watched the city bustle by and checked out that menu.

Our server, Brandon, made my love&apos;s day by announcing that the house soup was matzo ball, so we had to have some of that. I&apos;m just learning those ways to make a Jewish woman smile, and this happens to be one of said ways! The broth was soooo rich and delish, with the matzo formed just right, though the veggie representation was a tad bit shy (carrots only?). But that soup did its job, warming from the soul outwards.

I went with the Backyard - burg, grilled Canadian bacon, an onion ring that had a short lifespan, BBQ, and shredded cheddar that they clearly meant for six people. It was simply fabulous all put together. My partner went a touch healthier (snicker) with the Napa, pretty much just for the arugula and avocado, but it&apos;s still red meat, yo? Sidled up next to sweet potato fries, she was very happy.

Pricing is fairly Loop standard, meaning ya ain&apos;t getting out without dropping a Jackson or more, but it is completely worth it. Great service, warm environment, a great bar selection, and of course, fabulous food garners Doc B all of my stars to give."
5,"Awesome. Loved the menu. Loved the food. Loved the service. Great down to earth all American menu with something for everyone. I had a turkey burger in a lettuce bun with coleslaw and it was fantastic. This is going to sound weird but i loved the ice that was served in my ice tea. So refreshing. Husband enjoyed wok bowl but agreed wrong order for this type of place. Menu is inviting and there were 10 things I easily could have picked. Can&apos;t wait to go back. 
Edited to add- I went again tonight to this restaurant with my 11 year old who loved his burger and sweet potato fries. I ordered the &quot; number 1 tuna salad&quot; which might be the best salad I&apos;ve had in my lifetime ( ok tied with the seafood salad from falstroms ). I&apos;m convinced after my second visit that this has to be the best casual American restaurant in this town."
4,"This was my first time visiting this chain. Made reservations via OpenTable and strolled over during the dinner hour. Stepped through the maze of doors (for those really cold months ahead to attempt to keep that wind out) to the host. We were immediately led to a booth. Ambiance is casual, loud and lively. 

Decided to start with one of their cocktails: Crazy Beautiful (Straight Up)
Vodka, Voveti, elderflower &amp; spiced pear. Strong and not too sweet.

What I was really craving was a burger. I went with: Wedge Burger of Danish Blue, Sesame Seed Bun, Sunny-side up egg, candied bacon, lettuce &amp; tomato with roasted garlic dressing.  Was it worth the $18? Yes. Delicious and exactly what I was looking for. Served with French fries (or sweet potato fries, coleslaw, or quinoa) that I ate a few more than usual. Had no room for dessert. 

Server was friendly and attentive. A filling dinner after a long day of traveling."
1,"I&apos;ve been doordashing for a while now. I come in here and the staff is usually super polite. I went in the night of 2/2/21 and the order was taking a bit so I hung around. There was a new lady there, older, wearing a skirt. She was SCREAMING at the employees. It was one after another after another. There was cooks, a girl with her hair up who is usually at the front desk, and some other employees I don&apos;t remember. Honestly if I was a customer I would have demanded her manager (assuming she was one). It took everything in my power not to speak up. The tip of the iceburg was hearing her talk badly about the customers as she walked by me. I have ears. 0/5 do not recommend going here. Management displays unprofessionalism."
2,"This was a Rough Experience, with Gross Seats, and Mediocre Food.

We asked for a booth and when presented the booth, the bench was disgusting--take a look at the picture. It&apos;s not like it was just dirty, it that it&apos;s gotten worse and worse over time and no one seems to care. I mentioned it to the staff and manager and only hope that it has been cleaned or reupholstered.

I ordered the Cajun Chicken Club ($17), a fried chicken breast with Monterey Jack, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and dijon honey, tucked in a pretzel bun, and served with fries. It was pathetic--a thin, sad breast of chicken with little-to-no toppings, flavor, or satiation. My date ordered the Wok Out Bowl with Tuna ($23) and sticky brown rice and a sweet and spicy Thai sauce, served with market veggies and chopped cashews. She was underwhelmed as well, as the bowl had little-to-no flavors and just seemed phoned in. Our kids ordered the cheeseburger and fries which my date and I both coveted and wished we ordered.

Kind of surprised this place got such high reviews, seeing Chicago is such a foodie town and folks would have a more discerning palette."
5,"Ribs were amazing, the baked potato was the size of my head, and I&apos;m still salivating over the number six sandwich. Would equate it to a Bandera, but better (not as salty)!"
5,Very good food!! I think the burgers are overpriced but they are very good and they are massive. I like the Matzo ball soup and the chili too. The service is great. They have happy hour
5,"We thought this place was fabulous! We randomly picked it because my dad is is a Doctor B lol and it turned out to be a great choice. Definitely make a reservation for dinner. We did it right through Yelp. The sweet potato fries are great! Very thick cut which I like. I got the shrimp salad and fries, my dad got ribs and ate the whole taco, and my mom got a chicken wok bowl. Then we split chocolate cake which was moist and not too rich."
2,"We ordered a steak frites, the chicken satay, a coke, and Oreo balls. The food all came cold, we got no utensils or napkins with our steak and we were in a hotel that also could not offer us utensils due to COVID, so we essentially couldn&apos;t even eat our steak. Not to mention our Oreo balls also didn&apos;t come OR the drink. When I called and complained about the order, and our inability to eat our food, the staff was short, and said &quot;thanks have a good one&quot; and hung up on me before I was even finished speaking to her. 
Chicken satay and peanut sauce was good just wish it hadn&apos;t come cold. 
Will be looking else where next time I order."
5,"This is a wonderful healthy carry out/pick-up option. I tried one of the Wok out bowls with quinoa and my husband had a burger. Both were ready quickly, great portion sizes, and delicious. We&apos;re so glad the location on Grand is open for pick up!"
5,"So glad to see restaurants are open for business in this pandemic. Courtney, our server, was polite and attentive and delivered delicious food that was ready quickly. My daughter devoured the Veggie Burger while I enjoyed the Quinoa Salad and we split the Sweet Potato Fries. All-in-all, it was a wonderful dining experience in difficult times. If you find yourself in the River North neighborhood of Chicago, stop by this this gem."
5,"Their menu selection and food quality is amazing.  Dining in is definitely a 5 star experience,  carry out is a bit messier but always top notch quality"
5,"Great food, portions, music, good drink selection. 
Cajun chicken sandwich with fries, one of the better chicken sandwiches I&apos;ve had
Ask for the garlic aioli"
4,"This spot is awesomeness located off of the Magnificent Mile, which makes for great views for those who like to people watch. It has a pretty laid back atmosphere meaning no bells and whistles here but you don&apos;t need that when they&apos;ve got great food and drinks!
I played it safe as it was my first time here and ordered the Chicken Sandwich with a side of Candied Bacon! Now that I&apos;m thinking about it, I should&apos;ve put a strip or two of the bacon on the sandwich.. Guess I&apos;ll have to go back and try that!
I totally don&apos;t mind doing so since Doc B&apos;s has such a creative food and drink menu. I ordered some type of Hibiscus drink which was light and refreshing. 
Overall, this is always a place to go when you don&apos;t know where else to go! You can&apos;t go wrong with Doc B&apos;s."
4,"My sister and I stopped here for lunch. The casual environment was great and the COVID precautions they took were decent. They even gave us our on bottle of hand sanitizer for our table.

The steak sandwich and steak we ordered were a little over cooked. We also had the Internal Affair cocktail and it was soooooo good. I slammed two of them, if it was the summer I would have pounded at least 3 more. It&apos;s a great lunch/casual spot!"
3,"Felt somewhat disappointed with this one but felt mislead by the outstanding Yelp reviews. Given the location I did prepare myself for a bit of a tourist trap with mediocre food and Doc B&apos;s is exactly that. 

Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich after scrolling through the Yelp page and being persuaded by picture after picture of the sandwich. MEH. Bun lacked some major moisture and the chicken lacked crisp. The sweet potato fries were oddly large cut and undercooked.  Overall, not a meal I would return for.

Service was good and they had hand sanitizer available at the table, which I appreciated."
4,"Ordered delivery through the yelp app and my dinner arrived within an hour, nicely packaged, with no issues. I got the veggie burger, which was really good - a unique blend of quinoa, black bean, and veggies plus the kale slaw on top was a nice touch. All the burger items on the menu come with a choice of side and this time I went with the sweet potato fries, but next time I&apos;d select something else (thick cut style just wasn&apos;t for me). 
Overall, I still really enjoyed my meal and would recommend as a good delivery option. While a little more ($$) than I&apos;d usually spend, I&apos;m happy to help safely support Chicago businesses during the pandemic."
4,"This review is written in memory of the fruit fly that kamikaze&apos;d into my husband&apos;s beer. May it rest in peace.

We ordered two items tonight, the brussel sprout salad with steak and the ledge burger. Both were DELICIOUS.  The burger was juicy and packed with flavor. The fries that came with the burger was perfect! We might go back just for more fries. The salad was also crisp and flavorful, and the steak was so good it melted in my mouth. It was weird though, that the steak was hidden inside my salad. For a second there, I thought the steak was forgotten! While digging around for it added a fun element, it also would have been nice to be see how much steak came with the salad. The food overall though, was very delicious all around. Oh and one odd compliment- the water here is so delicious! It tasted so clean and was very cold even without ice. I do appreciate a restaurant with great quality water!

The experience wasn&apos;t perfect though, because of the cleanliness factor. Even though we sat inside, fruit flies were every where and there were some food crumbs on the seats. The food made up for it though!"
4,"I&apos;ve found the quality of food here to be mostly great. We&apos;ve ordered takeout thrice, and, with a couple of notable exceptions, everything was excellent. I especially like their salads, which are thoughtfully put together and feature homemade dressings. My husband really likes the cucumber salad, although it was better the first time he tried it; it tasted like it had been sitting around too long the second time. We will skip both the fried chicken and the coleslaw from here on out. My years living in the south have spoiled me for truly remarkable fried chicken, and I&apos;ve found no counterpart here. Theirs is under seasoned and just not up to par. The coleslaw was decidedly sweet and had too much mayonnaise; with this much sugar, it needs the balancing factor that vinegar supplies. These have been rare blips, however, so 4 stars it is. The rather sizable and varied menu means that returns here don&apos;t get too one note."
3,"They have great burgers, sandwiches, and salads. The sweet potato fries are exceptional. The California Salad is delicious. The turkey burger was pretty good. I&apos;ve also tried the wok out bowl - it was pretty good, but a bit oily. I like how you can add whatever you want to it (choose your base, choose your protein, choose your sauce). I got mine with salmon, quinoa, and teriyaki sauce. The salmon was excellent and very well cooked. My friend always orders the crispy chicken sandwich and loves it. 

Can usually get a reservation not too far in advance, but the Gold Coast location can get VERY crowded on Fridays/Saturdays. Wouldn&apos;t say this is a super healthy place like it is advertised but could be worse."
5,"Like Ferris Bueller once said, there are &apos;4,000 restaurants in downtown Chicago&apos;, so you have plenty of choices. And given that this great city is known for its skill with beef, Doc B&apos;s is a fantastic choice should you crave that which once went &apos;moo&apos;, in burger form or otherwise.

With the wind whipping down Rush Street, we knew we needed a respite from the cold. Doc B&apos;s is done with minimalist decor and some relatively dim lighting, but it fits perfectly in the downtown bar &amp; dining scene. We snared a streetside window table and watched the city bustle by and checked out that menu.

Our server, Brandon, made my love&apos;s day by announcing that the house soup was matzo ball, so we had to have some of that. I&apos;m just learning those ways to make a Jewish woman smile, and this happens to be one of said ways! The broth was soooo rich and delish, with the matzo formed just right, though the veggie representation was a tad bit shy (carrots only?). But that soup did its job, warming from the soul outwards.

I went with the Backyard - burg, grilled Canadian bacon, an onion ring that had a short lifespan, BBQ, and shredded cheddar that they clearly meant for six people. It was simply fabulous all put together. My partner went a touch healthier (snicker) with the Napa, pretty much just for the arugula and avocado, but it&apos;s still red meat, yo? Sidled up next to sweet potato fries, she was very happy.

Pricing is fairly Loop standard, meaning ya ain&apos;t getting out without dropping a Jackson or more, but it is completely worth it. Great service, warm environment, a great bar selection, and of course, fabulous food garners Doc B all of my stars to give."

Will be looking else where next time I order."

5,"So glad to see restaurants are open for business in this pandemic. Courtney, our server, was polite and attentive and delivered delicious food that was ready quickly.

Cajun chicken sandwich with fries, one of the better chicken sandwiches I&apos;ve had

4,"This spot is awesomeness located off of the Magnificent Mile, which makes for great views for those who like to people watch. It has a pretty laid back atmosphere meaning no bells and whistles here but you don&apos;t need that when they&apos;ve got great food and drinks!
I played it safe as it was my first time here and ordered the Chicken Sandwich with a side of Candied Bacon! Now that I&apos;m thinking about it, I should&apos;ve put a strip or two of the bacon on the sandwich.. Guess I&apos;ll have to go back and try that!
I totally don&apos;t mind doing so since Doc B&apos;s has such a creative food and drink menu. I ordered some type of Hibiscus drink which was light and refreshing. 
Overall, this is always a place to go when you don&apos;t know where else to go! You can&apos;t go wrong with Doc B&apos;s."

3,"Felt somewhat disappointed with this one but felt mislead by the outstanding Yelp reviews. Given the location I did prepare myself for a bit of a tourist trap with mediocre food and Doc B&apos;s is exactly that. 

Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich after scrolling through the Yelp page and being persuaded by picture after picture of the sandwich. MEH. Bun lacked some major moisture and the chicken lacked crisp. The sweet potato fries were oddly large cut and undercooked.  Overall, not a meal I would return for.

Service was good and they had hand sanitizer available at the table, which I appreciated."
4,"Ordered delivery through the yelp app and my dinner arrived within an hour, nicely packaged, with no issues. I got the veggie burger, which was really good - a unique blend of quinoa, black bean, and veggies plus the kale slaw on top was a nice touch. All the burger items on the menu come with a choice of side and this time I went with the sweet potato fries, but next time I&apos;d select something else (thick cut style just wasn&apos;t for me). 
Overall, I still really enjoyed my meal and would recommend as a good delivery option. While a little more ($$) than I&apos;d usually spend, I&apos;m happy to help safely support Chicago businesses during the pandemic."
4,"This review is written in memory of the fruit fly that kamikaze&apos;d into my husband&apos;s beer. May it rest in peace.

We ordered two items tonight, the brussel sprout salad with steak and the ledge burger. Both were DELICIOUS.  The burger was juicy and packed with flavor. The fries that came with the burger was perfect! We might go back just for more fries. The salad was also crisp and flavorful, and the steak was so good it melted in my mouth. It was weird though, that the steak was hidden inside my salad. For a second there, I thought the steak was forgotten! While digging around for it added a fun element, it also would have been nice to be see how much steak came with the salad. The food overall though, was very delicious all around. Oh and one odd compliment- the water here is so delicious! It tasted so clean and was very cold even without ice. I do appreciate a restaurant with great quality water!

The experience wasn&apos;t perfect though, because of the cleanliness factor. Even though we sat inside, fruit flies were every where and there were some food crumbs on the seats. The food made up for it though!"
4,"I&apos;ve found the quality of food here to be mostly great. We&apos;ve ordered takeout thrice, and, with a couple of notable exceptions, everything was excellent. I especially like their salads, which are thoughtfully put together and feature homemade dressings. My husband really likes the cucumber salad, although it was better the first time he tried it; it tasted like it had been sitting around too long the second time. We will skip both the fried chicken and the coleslaw from here on out. My years living in the south have spoiled me for truly remarkable fried chicken, and I&apos;ve found no counterpart here. Theirs is under seasoned and just not up to par. The coleslaw was decidedly sweet and had too much mayonnaise; with this much sugar, it needs the balancing factor that vinegar supplies. These have been rare blips, however, so 4 stars it is. The rather sizable and varied menu means that returns here don&apos;t get too one note."
3,"They have great burgers, sandwiches, and salads. The sweet potato fries are exceptional. The California Salad is delicious. The turkey burger was pretty good.

5,"Like Ferris Bueller once said, there are &apos;4,000 restaurants in downtown Chicago&apos;, so you have plenty of choices. And given that this great city is known for its skill with beef, Doc B&apos;s is a fantastic choice should you crave that which once went &apos;moo&apos;, in burger form or otherwise.

With the wind whipping down Rush Street, we knew we needed a respite from the cold. Doc B&apos;s is done with minimalist decor and some relatively dim lighting, but it fits perfectly in the downtown bar &amp; dining scene. We snared a streetside window table and watched the city bustle by and checked out that menu.

Our server, Brandon, made my love&apos;s day by announcing that the house soup was matzo ball, so we had to have some of that. I&apos;m just learning those ways to make a Jewish woman smile, and this happens to be one of said ways! The broth was soooo rich and delish, with the matzo formed just right, though the veggie representation was a tad bit shy (carrots only?). But that soup did its job, warming from the soul outwards.

I went with the Backyard - burg, grilled Canadian bacon, an onion ring that had a short lifespan, BBQ, and shredded cheddar that they clearly meant for six people. It was simply fabulous all put together. My partner went a touch healthier (snicker) with the Napa, pretty much just for the arugula and avocado, but it&apos;s still red meat, yo? Sidled up next to sweet potato fries, she was very happy.

Pricing is fairly Loop standard, meaning ya ain&apos;t getting out without dropping a Jackson or more, but it is completely worth it. Great service, warm environment, a great bar selection, and of course, fabulous food garners Doc B all of my stars to give."
5,"Awesome. Loved the menu. Loved the food. Loved the service. Great down to earth all American menu with something for everyone. I had a turkey burger in a lettuce bun with coleslaw and it was fantastic. This is going to sound weird but i loved the ice that was served in my ice tea. So refreshing. Husband enjoyed wok bowl but agreed wrong order for this type of place. Menu is inviting and there were 10 things I easily could have picked. Can&apos;t wait to go back. 
Edited to add- I went again tonight to this restaurant with my 11 year old who loved his burger and sweet potato fries. I ordered the &quot; number 1 tuna salad&quot; which might be the best salad I&apos;ve had in my lifetime ( ok tied with the seafood salad from falstroms ). I&apos;m convinced after my second visit that this has to be the best casual American restaurant in this town."
4,"This was my first time visiting this chain. Made reservations via OpenTable and strolled over during the dinner hour. Stepped through the maze of doors (for those really cold months ahead to attempt to keep that wind out) to the host. We were immediately led to a booth. Ambiance is casual, loud and lively. 

Decided to start with one of their cocktails: Crazy Beautiful (Straight Up)
Vodka, Voveti, elderflower &amp; spiced pear. Strong and not too sweet.

What I was really craving was a burger. I went with: Wedge Burger of Danish Blue, Sesame Seed Bun, Sunny-side up egg, candied bacon, lettuce &amp; tomato with roasted garlic dressing.  Was it worth the $18? Yes. Delicious and exactly what I was looking for. Served with French fries (or sweet potato fries, coleslaw, or quinoa) that I ate a few more than usual. Had no room for dessert. 

Server was friendly and attentive. A filling dinner after a long day of traveling."
1,"I&apos;ve been doordashing for a while now. I come in here and the staff is usually super polite. I went in the night of 2/2/21 and the order was taking a bit so I hung around. There was a new lady there, older, wearing a skirt. She was SCREAMING at the employees. It was one after another after another. There was cooks, a girl with her hair up who is usually at the front desk, and some other employees I don&apos;t remember. Honestly if I was a customer I would have demanded her manager (assuming she was one). It took everything in my power not to speak up. The tip of the iceburg was hearing her talk badly about the customers as she walked by me. I have ears. 0/5 do not recommend going here. Management displays unprofessionalism."
2,"This was a Rough Experience, with Gross Seats, and Mediocre Food.

We asked for a booth and when presented the booth, the bench was disgusting--take a look at the picture. It&apos;s not like it was just dirty, it that it&apos;s gotten worse and worse over time and no one seems to care. I mentioned it to the staff and manager and only hope that it has been cleaned or reupholstered.

I ordered the Cajun Chicken Club ($17), a fried chicken breast with Monterey Jack, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and dijon honey, tucked in a pretzel bun, and served with fries. It was pathetic--a thin, sad breast of chicken with little-to-no toppings, flavor, or satiation. My date ordered the Wok Out Bowl with Tuna ($23) and sticky brown rice and a sweet and spicy Thai sauce, served with market veggies and chopped cashews. She was underwhelmed as well, as the bowl had little-to-no flavors and just seemed phoned in. Our kids ordered the cheeseburger and fries which my date and I both coveted and wished we ordered.

Kind of surprised this place got such high reviews, seeing Chicago is such a foodie town and folks would have a more discerning palette."
5,"Ribs were amazing, the baked potato was the size of my head, and I&apos;m still salivating over the number six sandwich. Would equate it to a Bandera, but better (not as salty)!"
5,Very good food!! I think the burgers are overpriced but they are very good and they are massive. I like the Matzo ball soup and the chili too. The service is great. They have happy hour
5,"We thought this place was fabulous! We randomly picked it because my dad is is a Doctor B lol and it turned out to be a great choice. Definitely make a reservation for dinner. We did it right through Yelp. The sweet potato fries are great! Very thick cut which I like. I got the shrimp salad and fries, my dad got ribs and ate the whole taco, and my mom got a chicken wok bowl. Then we split chocolate cake which was moist and not too rich."
2,"We ordered a steak frites, the chicken satay, a coke, and Oreo balls. The food all came cold, we got no utensils or napkins with our steak and we were in a hotel that also could not offer us utensils due to COVID, so we essentially couldn&apos;t even eat our steak. Not to mention our Oreo balls also didn&apos;t come OR the drink. When I called and complained about the order, and our inability to eat our food, the staff was short, and said &quot;thanks have a good one&quot; and hung up on me before I was even finished speaking to her.

And given that this great city is known for its skill with beef, Doc B&apos;s is a fantastic choice should you crave that which once went &apos;moo&apos;, in burger form or otherwise.

With the wind whipping down Rush Street, we knew we needed a respite from the cold. Doc B&apos;s is done with minimalist decor and some relatively dim lighting, but it fits perfectly in the downtown bar &amp; dining scene. We snared a streetside window table and watched the city bustle by and checked out that menu.

Our server, Brandon, made my love&apos;s day by announcing that the house soup was matzo ball, so we had to have some of that. I&apos;m just learning those ways to make a Jewish woman smile, and this happens to be one of said ways! The broth was soooo rich and delish, with the matzo formed just right, though the veggie representation was a tad bit shy (carrots only?). But that soup did its job, warming from the soul outwards.

I went with the Backyard - burg, grilled Canadian bacon, an onion ring that had a short lifespan, BBQ, and shredded cheddar that they clearly meant for six people. It was simply fabulous all put together. My partner went a touch healthier (snicker) with the Napa, pretty much just for the arugula and avocado, but it&apos;s still red meat, yo? Sidled up next to sweet potato fries, she was very happy.

Pricing is fairly Loop standard, meaning ya ain&apos;t getting out without dropping a Jackson or more, but it is completely worth it. Great service, warm environment, a great bar selection, and of course, fabulous food garners Doc B all of my stars to give."
5,"Awesome. Loved the menu. Loved the food. Loved the service. Great down to earth all American menu with something for everyone. I had a turkey burger in a lettuce bun with coleslaw and it was fantastic. This is going to sound weird but i loved the ice that was served in my ice tea. So refreshing. Husband enjoyed wok bowl but agreed wrong order for this type of place. Menu is inviting and there were 10 things I easily could have picked. Can&apos;t wait to go back. 
Edited to add- I went again tonight to this restaurant with my 11 year old who loved his burger and sweet potato fries. I ordered the &quot; number 1 tuna salad&quot; which might be the best salad I&apos;ve had in my lifetime ( ok tied with the seafood salad from falstroms ). I&apos;m convinced after my second visit that this has to be the best casual American restaurant in this town."
4,"This was my first time visiting this chain. Made reservations via OpenTable and strolled over during the dinner hour. Stepped through the maze of doors (for those really cold months ahead to attempt to keep that wind out) to the host. We were immediately led to a booth. Ambiance is casual, loud and lively. 

Decided to start with one of their cocktails: Crazy Beautiful (Straight Up)
Vodka, Voveti, elderflower &amp; spiced pear. Strong and not too sweet.

What I was really craving was a burger. I went with: Wedge Burger of Danish Blue, Sesame Seed Bun, Sunny-side up egg, candied bacon, lettuce &amp; tomato with roasted garlic dressing.  Was it worth the $18? Yes. Delicious and exactly what I was looking for. Served with French fries (or sweet potato fries, coleslaw, or quinoa) that I ate a few more than usual. Had no room for dessert. 

Server was friendly and attentive. A filling dinner after a long day of traveling."
1,"I&apos;ve been doordashing for a while now. I come in here and the staff is usually super polite. I went in the night of 2/2/21 and the order was taking a bit so I hung around. There was a new lady there, older, wearing a skirt. She was SCREAMING at the employees. It was one after another after another. There was cooks, a girl with her hair up who is usually at the front desk, and some other employees I don&apos;t remember. Honestly if I was a customer I would have demanded her manager (assuming she was one). It took everything in my power not to speak up. The tip of the iceburg was hearing her talk badly about the customers as she walked by me. I have ears. 0/5 do not recommend going here. Management displays unprofessionalism."
2,"This was a Rough Experience, with Gross Seats, and Mediocre Food.

We asked for a booth and when presented the booth, the bench was disgusting--take a look at the picture. It&apos;s not like it was just dirty, it that it&apos;s gotten worse and worse over time and no one seems to care. I mentioned it to the staff and manager and only hope that it has been cleaned or reupholstered.

I ordered the Cajun Chicken Club ($17), a fried chicken breast with Monterey Jack, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and dijon honey, tucked in a pretzel bun, and served with fries. It was pathetic--a thin, sad breast of chicken with little-to-no toppings, flavor, or satiation. My date ordered the Wok Out Bowl with Tuna ($23) and sticky brown rice and a sweet and spicy Thai sauce, served with market veggies and chopped cashews. She was underwhelmed as well, as the bowl had little-to-no flavors and just seemed phoned in. Our kids ordered the cheeseburger and fries which my date and I both coveted and wished we ordered.

Kind of surprised this place got such high reviews, seeing Chicago is such a foodie town and folks would have a more discerning palette."
5,"Ribs were amazing, the baked potato was the size of my head, and I&apos;m still salivating over the number six sandwich. Would equate it to a Bandera, but better (not as salty)!"
5,Very good food!! I think the burgers are overpriced but they are very good and they are massive. I like the Matzo ball soup and the chili too. The service is great. They have happy hour
5,"We thought this place was fabulous! We randomly picked it because my dad is is a Doctor B lol and it turned out to be a great choice. Definitely make a reservation for dinner. We did it right through Yelp. The sweet potato fries are great! Very thick cut which I like. I got the shrimp salad and fries, my dad got ribs and ate the whole taco, and my mom got a chicken wok bowl. Then we split chocolate cake which was moist and not too rich."
2,"We ordered a steak frites, the chicken satay, a coke, and Oreo balls. The food all came cold, we got no utensils or napkins with our steak and we were in a hotel that also could not offer us utensils due to COVID, so we essentially couldn&apos;t even eat our steak. Not to mention our Oreo balls also didn&apos;t come OR the drink. When I called and complained about the order, and our inability to eat our food, the staff was short, and said &quot;thanks have a good one&quot; and hung up on me before I was even finished speaking to her. 
Chicken satay and peanut sauce was good just wish it hadn&apos;t come cold. 
Will be looking else where next time I order."
5,"This is a wonderful healthy carry out/pick-up option. I tried one of the Wok out bowls with quinoa and my husband had a burger. Both were ready quickly, great portion sizes, and delicious. We&apos;re so glad the location on Grand is open for pick up!"
5,"So glad to see restaurants are open for business in this pandemic. Courtney, our server, was polite and attentive and delivered delicious food that was ready quickly. My daughter devoured the Veggie Burger while I enjoyed the Quinoa Salad and we split the Sweet Potato Fries. All-in-all, it was a wonderful dining experience in difficult times. If you find yourself in the River North neighborhood of Chicago, stop by this this gem."
5,"Their menu selection and food quality is amazing.  Dining in is definitely a 5 star experience,  carry out is a bit messier but always top notch quality"
5,"Great food, portions, music, good drink selection. 
Cajun chicken sandwich with fries, one of the better chicken sandwiches I&apos;ve had
Ask for the garlic aioli"
4,"This spot is awesomeness located off of the Magnificent Mile, which makes for great views for those who like to people watch. It has a pretty laid back atmosphere meaning no bells and whistles here but you don&apos;t need that when they&apos;ve got great food and drinks!
I played it safe as it was my first time here and ordered the Chicken Sandwich with a side of Candied Bacon! Now that I&apos;m thinking about it, I should&apos;ve put a strip or two of the bacon on the sandwich.. Guess I&apos;ll have to go back and try that!
I totally don&apos;t mind doing so since Doc B&apos;s has such a creative food and drink menu. I ordered some type of Hibiscus drink which was light and refreshing. 
Overall, this is always a place to go when you don&apos;t know where else to go! You can&apos;t go wrong with Doc B&apos;s."
4,"My sister and I stopped here for lunch. The casual environment was great and the COVID precautions they took were decent. They even gave us our on bottle of hand sanitizer for our table.

The steak sandwich and steak we ordered were a little over cooked. We also had the Internal Affair cocktail and it was soooooo good. I slammed two of them, if it was the summer I would have pounded at least 3 more. It&apos;s a great lunch/casual spot!"
3,"Felt somewhat disappointed with this one but felt mislead by the outstanding Yelp reviews. Given the location I did prepare myself for a bit of a tourist trap with mediocre food and Doc B&apos;s is exactly that. 

Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich after scrolling through the Yelp page and being persuaded by picture after picture of the sandwich. MEH. Bun lacked some major moisture and the chicken lacked crisp. The sweet potato fries were oddly large cut and undercooked.  Overall, not a meal I would return for.

Service was good and they had hand sanitizer available at the table, which I appreciated."
4,"Ordered delivery through the yelp app and my dinner arrived within an hour, nicely packaged, with no issues. I got the veggie burger, which was really good - a unique blend of quinoa, black bean, and veggies plus the kale slaw on top was a nice touch. All the burger items on the menu come with a choice of side and this time I went with the sweet potato fries, but next time I&apos;d select something else (thick cut style just wasn&apos;t for me). 
Overall, I still really enjoyed my meal and would recommend as a good delivery option. While a little more ($$) than I&apos;d usually spend, I&apos;m happy to help safely support Chicago businesses during the pandemic."
4,"This review is written in memory of the fruit fly that kamikaze&apos;d into my husband&apos;s beer. May it rest in peace.

We ordered two items tonight, the brussel sprout salad with steak and the ledge burger. Both were DELICIOUS.  The burger was juicy and packed with flavor. The fries that came with the burger was perfect! We might go back just for more fries. The salad was also crisp and flavorful, and the steak was so good it melted in my mouth. It was weird though, that the steak was hidden inside my salad. For a second there, I thought the steak was forgotten! While digging around for it added a fun element, it also would have been nice to be see how much steak came with the salad. The food overall though, was very delicious all around. Oh and one odd compliment- the water here is so delicious! It tasted so clean and was very cold even without ice. I do appreciate a restaurant with great quality water!

The experience wasn&apos;t perfect though, because of the cleanliness factor. Even though we sat inside, fruit flies were every where and there were some food crumbs on the seats. The food made up for it though!"
4,"I&apos;ve found the quality of food here to be mostly great. We&apos;ve ordered takeout thrice, and, with a couple of notable exceptions, everything was excellent. I especially like their salads, which are thoughtfully put together and feature homemade dressings. My husband really likes the cucumber salad, although it was better the first time he tried it; it tasted like it had been sitting around too long the second time. We will skip both the fried chicken and the coleslaw from here on out. My years living in the south have spoiled me for truly remarkable fried chicken, and I&apos;ve found no counterpart here. Theirs is under seasoned and just not up to par. The coleslaw was decidedly sweet and had too much mayonnaise; with this much sugar, it needs the balancing factor that vinegar supplies. These have been rare blips, however, so 4 stars it is. The rather sizable and varied menu means that returns here don&apos;t get too one note."
3,"They have great burgers, sandwiches, and salads. The sweet potato fries are exceptional. The California Salad is delicious. The turkey burger was pretty good. I&apos;ve also tried the wok out bowl - it was pretty good, but a bit oily. I like how you can add whatever you want to it (choose your base, choose your protein, choose your sauce). I got mine with salmon, quinoa, and teriyaki sauce. The salmon was excellent and very well cooked. My friend always orders the crispy chicken sandwich and loves it. 

Can usually get a reservation not too far in advance, but the Gold Coast location can get VERY crowded on Fridays/Saturdays. Wouldn&apos;t say this is a super healthy place like it is advertised but could be worse."

I went with the Backyard - burg, grilled Canadian bacon, an onion ring that had a short lifespan, BBQ, and shredded cheddar that they clearly meant for six people. It was simply fabulous all put together. My partner went a touch healthier (snicker) with the Napa, pretty much just for the arugula and avocado, but it&apos;s still red meat, yo?

Not to mention our Oreo balls also didn&apos;t come OR the drink. When I called and complained about the order, and our inability to eat our food, the staff was short, and said &quot;thanks have a good one&quot; and hung up on me before I was even finished speaking to her. 
Chicken satay and peanut sauce was good just wish it hadn&apos;t come cold. 
Will be looking else where next time I order."
