5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"

5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"

It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."

4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)

The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them.

That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.

The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."

My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."

SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo.

Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day.

I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES.

The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce.

5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."

5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."

4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"

Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good.

Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation.

He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"

I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food.

When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."

It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary.

The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly.

I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked.

Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate.

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"

5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."

4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)

The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them.

That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.

The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."

My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."

SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo.

Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day.

I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES.

The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce.

5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."

5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."

4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"

Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good.

Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation.

He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"

I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
5,"We ordered carry out for the Christmas holiday. 

Ordering couldn&apos;t have been easier. 

Pick up, even easier. Everything was super organized, everyone was socially distant. 

Crab bisque was wonderfully delicious. 
Seafood Cobb salad was scrumptious.
Stone crab, amazing as always. 
Crab cakes, yum!! 

Thank you for offering an amazing carry out and dining experience while you could not be open.

Looking forward to dining with you in 2021."
5,"Joe&apos;s is the place to eat stone crab. I experienced my first stone crab claws at the original Joe&apos;s location in Miami, FL. Ever since, I have been hooked. 

On this occasion, I ordered delivery for lunch from the Chicago location because my parents were in town. I ordered the Medium Stone Crab Claws (7 per order) ($59.95), Chilean Sea Bass ($42.95), Baked Potato, and Guiliana Prosseco ($24.00). 

Because my father loves baked potaotes I doctored the rather plain baked potato, which comes with chives and sour cream, with broccolini and munster cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious.

If you love seafood check out Joe&apos;s. I will warn that the price point is not practical. It is rather over priced to be honest. Save up and look into the Lettuce Entertain You membership perks. That way you can save some $$$. Joe&apos;s is great for special occasions and if you really want to spoil yourself. Check it out and take a look at my blog for more honest reviews!

5,"Customer service was superb from the moment they picked the phone to take my order. The lady was very kind and helpful when asked about the menu. The curbside pickup gentlemen who delivered the food and took the payment was also very friendly. The food was delicious, the stone crab was fresh and cold. The crab bisque was hot and tasty. The complimentary bread was fresh and soft. The Joes famous mustard sauce is out of this world. The key lime pie slice tastes just like the ones in Florida! (FYI -limes are actually shipped directly from Florida). I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are a seafood fan."
5,"If you have the chance to participate in a zoom dinner from Joe&apos;s, grab it! We have done Zoom meals with others, but Joe&apos;s learned from others for their first one. The meal was teamed with a wine tasting with Jordan wine. You got a red and white bottle with your order. When I picked up the order, they surprised me with a large Joe&apos;s box perfectly packed with food and the wine. No bag full of food from Joe&apos;s!
The food was excellent. It was partially cooked so we just had an easy warmup. We started with a whipped feta cheese dip and then a wonderful lobster tail appetizer. It was so well prepared and was remarkable after being warmed up. 
We had a choice of their salmon, which I think is the best in town, a steak fillet, or a cauliflower steak. The food was so well prepared that the quality suffered little being made ready at home. The sides were tasty truffle potatoes and asparagus. We finished with their wonderful key lime pie. 
The care in putting this meal together and the zoom presentation on cooking the food and wine discussion was perfect!
They lived up to their reputation for superb food!"
5,"We ordered the NYE package for two to go, and added crab claws, every item was executed perfectly and was packed up to go really nicely with clear instructions. The colossal stone crab claws were quite the treat. We were very partial to the lobsters and king crab, perfection in its simplicity that highlights the deft cookery. 

Dinner with both delicious, aesthetically beautiful, and a great value considering the high quality ingredients. We had a minor follow up question the next day, and received a very pleasant call from the manager, thank you very much. It&apos;s really great to experience and support a restaurant that puts this much care into the food and dining experience, many thanks!"
4,"First visit to Chicago location. We arrived to Chicago on a Friday, and in that particular day the curfew was dropped to 10 pm from 1 am due to covid 19 increased ratio. Needless to say, the ma√Ætre made some effort to accommodate us since we did not have reservation. 
We are from Miami so this location is not like the Joe&apos;s in South Beach.  This location is super casual and a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation. 
We ordered the scallops and filet mignon , both were cooked perfect and were very tasty as well. Scott, our server, who works a bartender as well, was very knowledgeable about the  menu and the wine as well, and made some priceless suggestions that complimented our entrees very nicely. He also told us about the other locations in DC and Vegas.  
The key lime pie was as good as the ones served  at the Joe&apos;s in Miami."
4,"I was a bit torn between 3 and 4 stars, but at the end of the day the food is delicious so the 4 wins out. We ordered takeout during COVID, and one of the meals was not in the bag upon arriving home. When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food.

When we called about it, they did note that it had been handwritten down for the order but did not appear punched into the actual computer and thus we were not charged for the meal. Still, they didn&apos;t really offer to fix it or try to get the meal to us across town.... for an upscale restaurant I guess I would&apos;ve expected a bit more.

The food itself was very good. My Caeser salad was tasty and I ate the whole thing... and while it&apos;s hard to really screw up a Caesar salad, I&apos;m not usually a salad person so definitely worth ordering if you are! I also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze. This was the primary reason for the 4th star. It was delicious and well-cooked. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the sea bass was actually very large and thick, so on the thicker, center parts you didn&apos;t get any taste of the miso (and the miso glaze was sooo good). 

Overall a bit pricey for my preferences, but if you want some decent seafood I would definitely recommend it!"
5,"My friend couldn&apos;t stop talking about this joint when we came for a visit. So when we got a little bit of a wiggle room, we did and here we are. Thanks JOSH!

The Appetizer Round

Oyster Platter: New Brunswick Oysters and Cape Cod. Super fresh, super delish. I love the mignonette with it. Such a refreshing way to start the smash mode.

Chilled Seafood Platter: Perfectly done, seafood comes right off the shell which is an indication of perfect execution. Divine!

Main Event

Wet Aged Ribeye: It&apos;s a really nice piece of meat. I adore the char flavors. Plus the seasoning is hella yummy.

Sole: Perfectly done, plus the guy deboning the fish table side definitely knew what he was doing. I got to see my husband&apos;s eyes light up when they did that. Reminds me of that time we ate fish in Napoli.

...

This spot definitely has that old school feel to it. Fancy place to eat and also the service was on point. Didn&apos;t skip a beat ever. I&apos;d definitely like to extend my appreciation to the staff.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
5,We have been to the original Joe&apos;s Stone crab in Miami Beach a few times and the place is always an amazing experience with great service and phenomenal food. It was our first time in Chicago and this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel and decided to go. As expected this place did not disappoint. My steak was cooked to perfection the cream spinach was heavenly as usual. My girlfriend had the scallops she liked them but wasn&apos;t crazy about them. The waiter offered to replace it with something else But she declined. We ended the meal with a delicious slice of Keylime pie which is always a heavenly experience. If you&apos;re looking for an amazing meal and are treated like a VIP this is your place. Keep up the great work guys. See you next time.
3,"I&apos;d prob give a 3.5 if I could but due to the overall experience, I can&apos;t bump to a four. Overall, the food and the experience was pretty good. It just simply wasn&apos;t worth the price for what you got.

Then bread came first which was average. Come on people... nice place, work on your bread! We ordered the stone crab to start, a colossal and a jumbo I believe... $60 for the colossal and $30 for the jumbo. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed. We had never had it before so we didn&apos;t know what to expect but the meat had little flavor and I understand it&apos;s market price but that was outrageous for the amount of meat. Then we also got the king crab... now that was worth it. Still VERY expensive but the quality and taste was AMAZING. We would come back for just that. We wouldn&apos;t order stone crab again. My husband also had some oysters which he said may be the best he&apos;s ever had. They had this garlic salted ice for the top which was delicious!

For an entree I got the 8oz filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. This was $48 with NO SIDES. I told the wait staff and they gave me a new steak but meanwhile the sides got cold and I kept eating them because I was starving so by the time my new steak came, I wasn&apos;t as hungry. The new steak was cooked perfect but under seasoned. I&apos;ve gotten the same steak for $15-20 at other restaurants so I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay that again. 

For sides, we got broccolini and sweet potato fries. Decent portions but $8-9 a piece. The broccolini was just like steamed... no flavor. I make better at home. The sweet potato fries were average. I&apos;ve had better. And they didn&apos;t come with any dipping sauce. 

For drinks we tried the white sangria and a sparkling rose, both which were very good.

Another note- we got married last weekend and we said it was our &quot;honeymoon&quot; dinner. We didn&apos;t expect anything but often times restaurants will provide free dessert or a champagne toast for special occasions and after the steak issue... nothing comped, nothing extra. We were kinda like hmm... ok. 

Overall, I&apos;d say we were disappointed. Nothing except the king crab and oysters were something to return for. With all the other options in the city... not sure we will be back."
5,"Joe&apos;s is an institution. Make a reservation. It is always packed so don&apos;t even think you&apos;ll get lucky without a reservation.

The atmosphere is 1950&apos;s classics, with Senatra and the likes humming in the background, white table linens, dimmed lighting, mahogany wood furniture, and mirrors everywhere. Definitely dress up to feel special in this historic location.

I couldn&apos;t help feeling that being the youngest customers played to our disadvantage. Everyone around was way above 40. our waiter was courteous but not as warm and charming as he was to an elderly table right next to us. It was our anniversary, and so was the couple&apos;s next to us. They got a complementary dessert while we did not. 

Expect to pay a pretty penny for delicious food. 

I judge restaurants by their bread baskets. The bread here hit the spot. The assortment included 6-7 different pieces of fresh, warm bread! Now, that&apos;s what I call a superior bread basket! I ate way too much bread and butter, and along with the filling soup, I didn&apos;t even need to order a main, I was that stuffed.

We got England clam chowder and seafood soup and both were superb. The chowder was so delicate, creamy, and hearty, it really could&apos;ve served as a meal of its own. The soup reminded me of a homemade tomato stew, which was nice in its own way. Not as &apos;luxurious&apos; as the chowder, but still a great choice.

For mains, we got fillet mignon Oscar with regular and sweet fries. The sides are good to share for 2-3 people, so plan accordingly. The fillet mignon was perfect--melted on the tongue, just the most satisfying piece of meat that you can have. The lobster tail was humongous. Never seen such huge lobster tail. What shocked me even more was how delicate it was. That lobster must&apos;ve been swimming right before it was cooked for me. The most delicate, juicy, and flavorful lobster I&apos;ve ever had in my entire life. What a treat!

Despite being physically ill from overeating, we could not help ordering dessert, which we took to go after tasting. The famous key lime pie was not for me. Way too sweet, and that&apos;s coming from a sugar addict. The tres leches havana heaven cake, on the other hand, was sheer heaven! So light and fluffy and delicate. All the caramel lovers--you need to taste this! The piece was humongous, too, so this is great for sharing!"
4,"Made reservations here in the dining room and it lived up to the expectations!

The oysters as seen were amazing! I STRONGLY recommend their grapefruit margarita. Seems like a strange drink but with sugar on the rim it was AMAZING. 

I also want to point out that the service is exceptional our waitress was timely, professional, and funny as a bonus! 

The only loss of a star was that I asked for medium on my steak and it came out extremely rare. However they immediately fixed the issue and brought out more of the amazing sweet corn. 

A little pricey but I would say that the quality of their service and food justifies the bill! 

Overall a great spot especially if you happen to be staying across the street is the Gwen like I was!"
5,We come here allllll of the time for any sort of celebrations. It&apos;s amazing! I love everything especially the peanut butter pie- don&apos;t skip out :)
5,"I&apos;m not a picky eater but very critical in the sense that to make me go &quot;wow this is good&quot; takes a great amount of skill and effort from the kitchen. 

This restaurant absolutely nailed it from food , service, ambience... everything was just absolutely phenomenal. I will definitely be returning for some more excellent seafood and steak . I really want to thank Dan for all the hospitality he demonstrated. 5/5 will be coming back for more."
4,"Favorite seafood &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurant in the city..so it was an obvious choice for my gurl and me while participating in #YelpsBigNightIn. 

Ordering was easy. Was ready within about an hour. When I got there, even during the virus, they were meticulous with their pickup area. Appreciated their people still in suits and gloves.  

Got home and the meal was as we expected. I ordered the ribeye bone-in with asparagus. Perfectly grilled medium well. Dont sleep on the butter cream sauce for the asparagus. She had the Chilean Sea Bass perfectly cooked with bok choi. 

Even to-go containers were elegant. Black aluminum containers with the inside gold colored? Best description I can give there.  Phenomenal experience.  As long as I&apos;ve been Yelper, that&apos;s my first time participating in one of the events. Even though I didnt get to see anyone, it was exciting!!!

Looking forward to the next one."
1,"I went to buy stone crab and crab cakes today. $119.46. I asked if I could buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order bec they have a holiday promo. You get a $25 bonus gift card to use at another time when you buy $100 gift card. Would you believe the bald man at the desk said, &quot;They DON&apos;T want you to buy a gift card and spend it on the same day. You have to come back another day!&quot; I almost cancelled my order! except I had already promised to bring the food to a friend. SHAME ON YOU, Joe&apos;s and Lettuce Entertain You, for not allowing me to buy a $100 gift card to pay for my order just to deprive me of the $25 bonus card to use at a later date!!! That is just BAD business practice and very Grinchy of you!"
4,"TAKE OUT SERVICE: 

I highly recommend their take out service. While the menu was limited during the second week of the Chi- quarantine , the items that were available certainly exceeded our expectations. 

Our decision to order takeout was after losing a long held reservation thanks to COVID-19. We moved ahead with our dinner plans minus the dine in fanfare as to celebrate a  birthday and was ratheer blown away by the presentation,  preparation and labeling on the takeout items. We ordered a few sides, 12oz Filet, Salmon Au Poirve, crab cakes and seafood salad. The salad was boxed in a manner which was perfect for left overs. The seafood and dressing were boxed separate, as wAs the case for the crab cake which was accompanied by a delicious sauce to add flavor. The filet&apos;s packaging included oven reheat label instructions with a special note to suggesting one refrain from using the microwave. 

Every item we ordered was without question just as flavorful and memorable as eating inside the restaurant in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a room full of other diners and wait staff."
5,"We absolutely love Joe&apos;s! Tonight we participated in Yelp&apos;s Big Night In ... RSVP and all! I had the Chilean Sea Bass with Bok Choi and Shitake Mushrooms. Very, very good. My husband had the Bone-In 16 oz. Ribeye ~ Medium. So good. We also had the steamed asparagus. To compliment our meal (like it needed it) I made diced potatoes &amp; onion! 
Joe&apos;s continues to surpass excellence and expectations, even in take-our orders. We&apos;re so happy to have participated tonight! Thanks for the invitation Yelp!"
5,"My fianc√© and I went to Joe&apos;s Seafood for our anniversary. I love the ambiance here. It is dark and intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The food is bomb too. 

We had a reservation, so there wasn&apos;t that much of a wait. We actually were seated pretty fast. Our waiter was very nice and informative. He was able to tell us all about the specials and things he recommended. Usually, I take staff recommendations into consideration when I order; however, I already knew what I wanted prior to coming. I ordered the fillet Oscar with beurre blanc sauce. It was soooooooo good. The fillet was cooked perfectly and the beurre blanc sauce gave it a great added flavor. It wasn&apos;t too heavy like I was anticipating with all the dense ingredients. My fianc√© ordered the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a great natural flavor. This dish was super light. The macaroni and cheese was earthy and creamy which tasted great. Finally, we ordered the apple pie and the restaurant put a candle on top since it was our anniversary. It was a very nice touch! 

Overall, I would definitely want to come here again. However, due to the prices, it will probably have to be another special occasion."
5,"Good Afternoon,

Simply sending a message to say THANK YOU! My boyfriend and I had reservations last night for two. It was our 1 year anniversary dating. Our service from start to finish was impeccable! I surprised Don and kidnapped him (lol) for the evening to celebrate in the city! Jennifer was our server and a handful of others. Jennifer was amazing! Our servers, bartender and entire staff....PERFECTION! From the Tuna Tartare as a appetizer...to the steak, shrimp, scallops and MORE...LOVED IT ALL!

In a day and age where it&apos;s been hard to function &quot;normally&quot; due to covid-19, we felt at home, safe, welcomed and appreciated!

The bartender was so kind to make my &quot;custom&quot; cocktail...happily. We wanted dessert to go (brought it back to the hotel.) Jennifer sent us with an extra dessert....so kind!...

...we were so incredibly impressed and wanted to sing your praises! Our favorite restaurant in MKE is Harbor House. We now have found our favorite restaurant in Chicago! THANK YOU for helping to make our one year anniversary extra special!

Carla and Don appreciate all you do! Tell Jen and your entire staff THANK YOU!"
