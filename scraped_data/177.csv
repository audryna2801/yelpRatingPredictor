5,"I wanted to try this place for years, and never got a chance. With COVID dining became takeout and delivery only, so I decided to give this place a try. 

Their eel rolls were excellent. Perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked. We tried several other rolls and all of them were cooked to perfection. I did not have a chance to try their BBQ, but I am looking forward to it. This place gets a five-star rating for their quality of food and nice seating area. I can&apos;t wait to actually dine in."
5,"We loved our time at Union. Husband got the pork cutlet (because he&apos;s scared of ) and I tried the black rice sushi roll sampler. The Hokkaido roll was by far my favorite on the sampler--scallop, avocado, jalapeño wrapped in soy paper. The Devon is made with sweet potato and had great flavor and a surprising crunch to it. I&apos;ve not had black rice sushi before--don&apos;t let that scare you off because it&apos;s delicious!

Don&apos;t skip dessert! The Chocolate Crunch Mousse was so light and fluffy. 

For COVID, they have barriers up between all of the tables. Serving food and drinks on single use disposable dishes (except the soy sauce) and silverware. Staff is all wearing masks and gloves."
5,"What a great experience!  A unique menu, for sure! 

Our table ordered cauliflower salad, a mushroom roll, miso soup, tempura platter and the pork belly. Everything was awesome. We had one little problem and the corrected the plate and it was perfect! 

Service was excellent and was provided by Vina. During this pandemic it also feels like this business has gone over and above to be cautious. 

Thank you."
4,"I was excited to try this place after passing it several times and had a good experience overall. The outdoor seating is nice, except for the noise of the El right above.

We started with the lychee martinis, which were strong and delicious. I loved the two fresh lychees, although they were not as sweet and ripe as I would have liked. 

The highlight of the black sushi sampler was definitely the scallop sushi. It was beautiful and delicious. It also included some of the best sweet potato tempura sushi I&apos;ve had. The tuna sushi was good, but could have used some crunch or another element. 

We also got the BBQ chicken. I was surprised to find that it was very reminiscent of an Indian curry, rather than the Japanese BBQ I was expecting. It was good, although maybe not the first thing I would order again. 

Overall, this was a good experience. The service is friendly and I really enjoyed changing it up with the black rice sushi. I might not be back right away, especially considering the higher price, but I would definitely consider coming back again."
5,"Had a dinner reservation in February during All Star Weekend. 

It&apos;s a great atmosphere. Our waiter, Javier was great! He was very pleasant and he knew the menu very well! Everything he recommended was on point! The portions are perfect and delicious!

We took advantage of some of the specials, I had two Moscow mules and my husband had Sake. I was pleasantly surprised by the oysters! They are a must try! Trust me, you&apos;ll not be disappointed! 

We really enjoy our visit and will be going back for sure!"
4,"We came here for dinner and enjoyed the service and environment. We ordered in sharing fashion so we could sample more than less. Our sushi selections consisted of the Shrimp Tempura Roll and Smoked Salmon Nigiri which was pretty fresh. We also got the Truffle Ahí Tuna and the Miso salmon. I had a Tequila Moscow Mule that had a generous portion of liquor so no complaints there. Portions and prices meshed just right which made the experience even better. Whether on a date or hanging out with your friends, you&apos;ll enjoy the sociable atmosphere."
4,"Came for the $5 happy hour moscow mules, stayed for the delicious black rice bay street cali rolls. 

Union was a great recommendation from a local friend who works in the area. My 3 pals and I came here before a concert and luckily were able to sneak in at 6pm, with 30 minutes left to spare for happy hour. 

We ordered a round of moscow mules for the table. They have a few different varieties - one of my pals go the tequila variation, while I got the gin, and our two other friends got the original. Yum, yum, yum! Since happy hour was almost over, we got a few of these at once. 

My one friend and I split the happy hour oysters ($1.50/each HH price) and as a table we split two orders of the spicy shrimp rolls ($6 HH price). I loved both, but especially the spicy shrimp rolls. 

For my main entree, I got the black rice bay street cali roll. Different than most cali rolls, I&apos;ve had in the past, one of the main reasons being because of the black rice (subbed it for the supposed health benefits), and the other reason being because it had more flavor than other cali rolls. I&apos;d say this was the highlight of my dinner!

Service for the most part was great! He did forget to bring our spicy mayo, but other than that, he was always on top of our drink and food orders. 

Union is dark, romantic, and modern. Perfect for any occasion, birthday, date night, or even a weekday dinner. I&apos;d love to come back again to try more of their menu!"
5,"I ended up coming here for lunch the other day as my coworker had recommended it!

Let me tell you, the lamb chops are DELICIOUS!

A baby arugula salad comes with the lamb chops and it was simply delicious. It is a small plate, so if you are really hungry you would want to get something else to go with it. 

The ambiance and service was great!

I am looking forward to coming back here and trying  some of the other dishes.

Check it out and let me know what you think!"
3,"Awesome service and very good sushi. Nothing over the top amazing, just good. Music is loud and lights bright but The host did dim  the lights on my behalf which I greatly appreciated. This is a very Covid friendly place with all the precautions that will make you feel really safe and comfortable.  I have very high standards for sushi that&apos;s the three stars but I think most people really enjoy the spot perfectly if you&apos;re young."
5,"Happy hour, happy hour, where do we go!? I was meeting a friend after work to catch up over happy hour and was craving the bay street cali roll so we had to come here. Not to mention the amazing happy hour that they have from 5-6:30PM daily and we made it by 5:30 so we were IN in to WIN it. 

Their Happy Hour Menu is:
 $1.50 Oysters
 $3 Beef Filet Skewers
 $6 Spicy Shrimp Sushi Rolls
 $10 Truffled Tuna
 $5 Glasses of Rose
 $5 Moscow Mules
Half Price Sake

I got the Moscow mule and my friend got the Rose and we both loved our drinks. The complimentary edamame is also a nice touch once you sit down. The bay street cali roll was as amazing as ever. The homemade crab cake literally melts in your mouth and I got an extra side of the spicy mayo because, obviously. I also tried something new. They have black rice! I was hesitant at first but it&apos;s healthier and was recommended, so why not? I liked it and has a bit sweeter taste.

I also ordered the chicken ramen. This bowl is HUGE. I took half it home because it was so big. I enjoyed the red pepper flake garlic oil and I&apos;ll know next time if I order this it is fully sufficient for an entire meal.

Our server was Xavier and we found out he was very new to the job. He was friendly and very attentive. ALL of the staff were friendly and attentive. I don&apos;t think my water glass ever went below the halfway mark. Everyone was wearing a big smile and I love seeing that. Makes the whole experience that much more memorable :) 

Anyhoo, I had to write about this spot again because it&apos;s so good and you need to check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"This should&apos;ve been a 5 star review :( 
But unfortunately the service was sub par. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat. I loved that they played old R&amp;B hits. It&apos;s not your typical sushi spot. 

The food was great! Full of flavor and they offer &quot;black&quot; rice which I&apos;ve never heard of before! But apparently it&apos;s the healthiest rice known to man and really good! 

However, we waited over an hour for our food to be served and 30 minutes for every round of drinks we ordered. We started off buying sake by the bottle ..our waitress informed us that there were only two bottles of the Sake we were drinking. We told her we&apos;d take both but  wanted the second bottle to be served after the first bottle. When it was time for the second bottle our waitress disappeared or 45 minutes only to return and inform us that she couldn&apos;t find it. *eye roll* So we ended up switching to tequila but again had to wait 30 minutes just to receive our drinks. 

Overall, great food. Shit service. Enter at your own risk :)"
5,"Dropped in for happy hour and what a treat!  The Whiskey Boy is a great cocktail. Add some of the small bites and you&apos;ll be happy. The miso salmon is amazing and the Buffalo duck wing is AWESOME!  The staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Stop by!"
4,"A large group of us came here for dinner before a night out. It was really good and they offered a lot of specials! We just so happened to come during happy hour which had great food and drink deals.

We initially thought this place was similar to korean bbq but found that they just had a list of meat you can get grilled by the chef&apos;s at the bbq bar. A lot of us took advantage of the happy hour deals that included sushi, meat sticks, and moscow mules. The sushi was delicious!

I really liked the decor and vibe of the restaurant!"
5,Union Sushi + BBQ Bar never fails. I love their calamari so that&apos;s always a must for me. I tried the black rice sushi yesterday. Initially I was nervous but it&apos;s very good. It taste the same to me AND it&apos;s healthier. Why not? I definitely recommend the sampler. My favorite was the Hokkaido. The Devon is a sweet potato roll. Do not be intimidated. It&apos;s amazing!
2,"Ordered Shrimp Tempura, Bristol Bay, and Bay Street California rolls and seaweed salad for delivery. 

Delivery packaging - not very temper proof. The sticker on the paper bag wasn&apos;t placed properly, I wouldn&apos;t even know if the food was tempered with.

Food - the rolls are super small, and average tasting at best. Rice didn&apos;t taste fresh, the ingredients inside all 3 rolls were bland. The only one I thought was okay was the Bay Street California, which had crab cake inside. Overall over-priced, and not worth it. 

Seaweed salad - you really can&apos;t mess this one up, but the one I got severely lacked seasoning/rice vinegar, and was dry. Luckily I had some at home, and I had to put in quite a bit.

I&apos;ve dined once before and wasn&apos;t impressed either, but thought I&apos;d give it another try during quarantine. Conclusion, it&apos;s still a no-go for me."
5,"Lively atmosphere with basic sushi rolls and not so basic rolls. They gave us complimentary appetizers and also a special treat at the end of the meal (dessert) as it was our anniversary. 

I really love this place. It&apos;s not overly pretentious but also not a place you&apos;d go wearing gym clothes. Ambiance really is spot on.

The only disappointment was that I made an open table reservation and they didn&apos;t validate my reservation so I could get my points? Weird.

Our server was on point. I&apos;d come here again if I were in town."
3,"My friend and I came here for a late dinner, and despite it being a weekday and late, the place was decently crowded. We had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we hurriedly ordered. Our server was attentive and nice throughout our meal.

Old city market roll (4/5): This roll didn&apos;t have rice in it?! Maybe I should be glad that a bigger proportion of the roll was fish, but I still missed the familiarity of rice in a roll ready to absorb soy sauce and tying everything together.

Saba nigiri (5/5): mackerel is my favorite fish in nigiri, so I usually order it when I&apos;m at a sushi restaurant, and it didn&apos;t disappoint!

Duck yaki soba (3/5): This was soup-less noodles and was described as having tonkatsu sauce in it, but I found it quite dry. It had decent flavor and a nice spicy kick to it, but there were pieces of pepper in it where the skin of the pepper felt really tough and almost inedible. I left the dish almost untouched."
4,My husbands favorite place. My favorites are the coconut gelato because it has crispy coco flakes and it goes well with the gelato. Uni soba with ikura is unbeatable. They have good quality sushi and different type of rice like black rice. Oysters is ok to have but picture looks better than taste. I love crispy calamari but they can make it better because it&apos;s small cuts ( looks like those low quality frozen calamari) and lost the texture of it and it&apos;s lack of flavor.
4,"TLDR
Happy Hour menu items = solid, Old City Market maki, seafood ramen, robata skewers and crab legs. 

GETTING THERE
With its flashy red neon sign, Union is difficult to miss heading down Franklin. There&apos;s plenty of meter parking along the sidewalk, but the Chicago brown line is just a couple blocks north. Might be a probably the better option on a busy night. 

FARE
They have got unique and adventurous ramen selection. While our table set it a goal for each person to order different bowl of ramen, the server decided to step in and steer us to the right direction of choosing spicy pigtail or seafood ramen instead of the beef cheek as they are the most popular bowls in house. Thanks for looking out for us! Just a heads up, the uni alfredo soba is much smaller than the rest of the ramen bowls. The uni and suck sobas are dry while the other ramen counterparts are soup based. 

Union surely has you covered with the full Japanese cuisine experience. Ranging from colorful ramen, sushi, salads, appetizers, robata grill, there&apos;s surely something for everyone! I surely anticipate my next visit to try the rest of their menu."
4,"They&apos;re sushi never disappoints. It&apos;s flavorful and fresh but way too expensive for an eight piece roll compared to other restaurant. I also tried the oysters but as someone who loves the pure oyster flavor, the toppings over powered each one. It left me wishing the toppings were on the side so I can add my own amount. 

The ambiance is what I like most. It&apos;s a very trendy location and they play great old r&amp;b and hip hop choices. It&apos;s a solid choice that typically isn&apos;t too busy. In addition, they have great Moscow miles on happy hour for $5 which tasted great despite the lack of liquor in it."

Union was a great recommendation from a local friend who works in the area. My 3 pals and I came here before a concert and luckily were able to sneak in at 6pm, with 30 minutes left to spare for happy hour. 

We ordered a round of moscow mules for the table. They have a few different varieties - one of my pals go the tequila variation, while I got the gin, and our two other friends got the original. Yum, yum, yum! Since happy hour was almost over, we got a few of these at once. 

My one friend and I split the happy hour oysters ($1.50/each HH price) and as a table we split two orders of the spicy shrimp rolls ($6 HH price). I loved both, but especially the spicy shrimp rolls. 

For my main entree, I got the black rice bay street cali roll. Different than most cali rolls, I&apos;ve had in the past, one of the main reasons being because of the black rice (subbed it for the supposed health benefits), and the other reason being because it had more flavor than other cali rolls. I&apos;d say this was the highlight of my dinner!

Service for the most part was great! He did forget to bring our spicy mayo, but other than that, he was always on top of our drink and food orders. 

Union is dark, romantic, and modern. Perfect for any occasion, birthday, date night, or even a weekday dinner. I&apos;d love to come back again to try more of their menu!"
5,"I ended up coming here for lunch the other day as my coworker had recommended it!

Let me tell you, the lamb chops are DELICIOUS!

A baby arugula salad comes with the lamb chops and it was simply delicious. It is a small plate, so if you are really hungry you would want to get something else to go with it. 

The ambiance and service was great!

I am looking forward to coming back here and trying  some of the other dishes.

Check it out and let me know what you think!"
3,"Awesome service and very good sushi. Nothing over the top amazing, just good. Music is loud and lights bright but The host did dim  the lights on my behalf which I greatly appreciated. This is a very Covid friendly place with all the precautions that will make you feel really safe and comfortable.  I have very high standards for sushi that&apos;s the three stars but I think most people really enjoy the spot perfectly if you&apos;re young."
5,"Happy hour, happy hour, where do we go!? I was meeting a friend after work to catch up over happy hour and was craving the bay street cali roll so we had to come here. Not to mention the amazing happy hour that they have from 5-6:30PM daily and we made it by 5:30 so we were IN in to WIN it. 

Their Happy Hour Menu is:
 $1.50 Oysters
 $3 Beef Filet Skewers
 $6 Spicy Shrimp Sushi Rolls
 $10 Truffled Tuna
 $5 Glasses of Rose
 $5 Moscow Mules
Half Price Sake

I got the Moscow mule and my friend got the Rose and we both loved our drinks. The complimentary edamame is also a nice touch once you sit down. The bay street cali roll was as amazing as ever. The homemade crab cake literally melts in your mouth and I got an extra side of the spicy mayo because, obviously. I also tried something new. They have black rice! I was hesitant at first but it&apos;s healthier and was recommended, so why not? I liked it and has a bit sweeter taste.

I also ordered the chicken ramen. This bowl is HUGE. I took half it home because it was so big. I enjoyed the red pepper flake garlic oil and I&apos;ll know next time if I order this it is fully sufficient for an entire meal.

Our server was Xavier and we found out he was very new to the job. He was friendly and very attentive. ALL of the staff were friendly and attentive. I don&apos;t think my water glass ever went below the halfway mark. Everyone was wearing a big smile and I love seeing that. Makes the whole experience that much more memorable :) 

Anyhoo, I had to write about this spot again because it&apos;s so good and you need to check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"This should&apos;ve been a 5 star review :( 
But unfortunately the service was sub par. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat. I loved that they played old R&amp;B hits. It&apos;s not your typical sushi spot. 

The food was great! Full of flavor and they offer &quot;black&quot; rice which I&apos;ve never heard of before! But apparently it&apos;s the healthiest rice known to man and really good! 

However, we waited over an hour for our food to be served and 30 minutes for every round of drinks we ordered. We started off buying sake by the bottle ..our waitress informed us that there were only two bottles of the Sake we were drinking. We told her we&apos;d take both but  wanted the second bottle to be served after the first bottle. When it was time for the second bottle our waitress disappeared or 45 minutes only to return and inform us that she couldn&apos;t find it. *eye roll* So we ended up switching to tequila but again had to wait 30 minutes just to receive our drinks. 

Overall, great food. Shit service. Enter at your own risk :)"
5,"Dropped in for happy hour and what a treat!  The Whiskey Boy is a great cocktail. Add some of the small bites and you&apos;ll be happy. The miso salmon is amazing and the Buffalo duck wing is AWESOME!  The staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Stop by!"
4,"A large group of us came here for dinner before a night out. It was really good and they offered a lot of specials! We just so happened to come during happy hour which had great food and drink deals.

We initially thought this place was similar to korean bbq but found that they just had a list of meat you can get grilled by the chef&apos;s at the bbq bar. A lot of us took advantage of the happy hour deals that included sushi, meat sticks, and moscow mules. The sushi was delicious!

I really liked the decor and vibe of the restaurant!"
5,Union Sushi + BBQ Bar never fails. I love their calamari so that&apos;s always a must for me. I tried the black rice sushi yesterday. Initially I was nervous but it&apos;s very good. It taste the same to me AND it&apos;s healthier. Why not? I definitely recommend the sampler. My favorite was the Hokkaido. The Devon is a sweet potato roll. Do not be intimidated. It&apos;s amazing!
2,"Ordered Shrimp Tempura, Bristol Bay, and Bay Street California rolls and seaweed salad for delivery. 

Delivery packaging - not very temper proof. The sticker on the paper bag wasn&apos;t placed properly, I wouldn&apos;t even know if the food was tempered with.

Food - the rolls are super small, and average tasting at best. Rice didn&apos;t taste fresh, the ingredients inside all 3 rolls were bland. The only one I thought was okay was the Bay Street California, which had crab cake inside. Overall over-priced, and not worth it. 

Seaweed salad - you really can&apos;t mess this one up, but the one I got severely lacked seasoning/rice vinegar, and was dry. Luckily I had some at home, and I had to put in quite a bit.

I&apos;ve dined once before and wasn&apos;t impressed either, but thought I&apos;d give it another try during quarantine. Conclusion, it&apos;s still a no-go for me."
5,"Lively atmosphere with basic sushi rolls and not so basic rolls. They gave us complimentary appetizers and also a special treat at the end of the meal (dessert) as it was our anniversary. 

I really love this place. It&apos;s not overly pretentious but also not a place you&apos;d go wearing gym clothes. Ambiance really is spot on.

The only disappointment was that I made an open table reservation and they didn&apos;t validate my reservation so I could get my points? Weird.

Our server was on point. I&apos;d come here again if I were in town."
3,"My friend and I came here for a late dinner, and despite it being a weekday and late, the place was decently crowded. We had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we hurriedly ordered. Our server was attentive and nice throughout our meal.

Old city market roll (4/5): This roll didn&apos;t have rice in it?! Maybe I should be glad that a bigger proportion of the roll was fish, but I still missed the familiarity of rice in a roll ready to absorb soy sauce and tying everything together.

Saba nigiri (5/5): mackerel is my favorite fish in nigiri, so I usually order it when I&apos;m at a sushi restaurant, and it didn&apos;t disappoint!

Duck yaki soba (3/5): This was soup-less noodles and was described as having tonkatsu sauce in it, but I found it quite dry. It had decent flavor and a nice spicy kick to it, but there were pieces of pepper in it where the skin of the pepper felt really tough and almost inedible. I left the dish almost untouched."
4,My husbands favorite place. My favorites are the coconut gelato because it has crispy coco flakes and it goes well with the gelato. Uni soba with ikura is unbeatable. They have good quality sushi and different type of rice like black rice. Oysters is ok to have but picture looks better than taste. I love crispy calamari but they can make it better because it&apos;s small cuts ( looks like those low quality frozen calamari) and lost the texture of it and it&apos;s lack of flavor.
4,"TLDR
Happy Hour menu items = solid, Old City Market maki, seafood ramen, robata skewers and crab legs. 

GETTING THERE
With its flashy red neon sign, Union is difficult to miss heading down Franklin. There&apos;s plenty of meter parking along the sidewalk, but the Chicago brown line is just a couple blocks north. Might be a probably the better option on a busy night. 

FARE
They have got unique and adventurous ramen selection. While our table set it a goal for each person to order different bowl of ramen, the server decided to step in and steer us to the right direction of choosing spicy pigtail or seafood ramen instead of the beef cheek as they are the most popular bowls in house. Thanks for looking out for us! Just a heads up, the uni alfredo soba is much smaller than the rest of the ramen bowls. The uni and suck sobas are dry while the other ramen counterparts are soup based. 

Union surely has you covered with the full Japanese cuisine experience. Ranging from colorful ramen, sushi, salads, appetizers, robata grill, there&apos;s surely something for everyone! I surely anticipate my next visit to try the rest of their menu."
4,"They&apos;re sushi never disappoints. It&apos;s flavorful and fresh but way too expensive for an eight piece roll compared to other restaurant. I also tried the oysters but as someone who loves the pure oyster flavor, the toppings over powered each one. It left me wishing the toppings were on the side so I can add my own amount. 

The ambiance is what I like most. It&apos;s a very trendy location and they play great old r&amp;b and hip hop choices. It&apos;s a solid choice that typically isn&apos;t too busy. In addition, they have great Moscow miles on happy hour for $5 which tasted great despite the lack of liquor in it."
5,"I wanted to try this place for years, and never got a chance. With COVID dining became takeout and delivery only, so I decided to give this place a try. 

Their eel rolls were excellent. Perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked. We tried several other rolls and all of them were cooked to perfection. I did not have a chance to try their BBQ, but I am looking forward to it. This place gets a five-star rating for their quality of food and nice seating area. I can&apos;t wait to actually dine in."
5,"We loved our time at Union. Husband got the pork cutlet (because he&apos;s scared of ) and I tried the black rice sushi roll sampler. The Hokkaido roll was by far my favorite on the sampler--scallop, avocado, jalapeño wrapped in soy paper. The Devon is made with sweet potato and had great flavor and a surprising crunch to it. I&apos;ve not had black rice sushi before--don&apos;t let that scare you off because it&apos;s delicious!

Don&apos;t skip dessert! The Chocolate Crunch Mousse was so light and fluffy. 

For COVID, they have barriers up between all of the tables. Serving food and drinks on single use disposable dishes (except the soy sauce) and silverware. Staff is all wearing masks and gloves."
5,"What a great experience!  A unique menu, for sure! 

Our table ordered cauliflower salad, a mushroom roll, miso soup, tempura platter and the pork belly. Everything was awesome. We had one little problem and the corrected the plate and it was perfect! 

Service was excellent and was provided by Vina. During this pandemic it also feels like this business has gone over and above to be cautious. 

Thank you."
4,"I was excited to try this place after passing it several times and had a good experience overall. The outdoor seating is nice, except for the noise of the El right above.

We started with the lychee martinis, which were strong and delicious. I loved the two fresh lychees, although they were not as sweet and ripe as I would have liked. 

The highlight of the black sushi sampler was definitely the scallop sushi. It was beautiful and delicious. It also included some of the best sweet potato tempura sushi I&apos;ve had. The tuna sushi was good, but could have used some crunch or another element. 

We also got the BBQ chicken. I was surprised to find that it was very reminiscent of an Indian curry, rather than the Japanese BBQ I was expecting. It was good, although maybe not the first thing I would order again. 

Overall, this was a good experience. The service is friendly and I really enjoyed changing it up with the black rice sushi. I might not be back right away, especially considering the higher price, but I would definitely consider coming back again."
5,"Had a dinner reservation in February during All Star Weekend. 

It&apos;s a great atmosphere. Our waiter, Javier was great! He was very pleasant and he knew the menu very well! Everything he recommended was on point! The portions are perfect and delicious!

We took advantage of some of the specials, I had two Moscow mules and my husband had Sake. I was pleasantly surprised by the oysters! They are a must try! Trust me, you&apos;ll not be disappointed! 

We really enjoy our visit and will be going back for sure!"
4,"We came here for dinner and enjoyed the service and environment. We ordered in sharing fashion so we could sample more than less. Our sushi selections consisted of the Shrimp Tempura Roll and Smoked Salmon Nigiri which was pretty fresh. We also got the Truffle Ahí Tuna and the Miso salmon. I had a Tequila Moscow Mule that had a generous portion of liquor so no complaints there. Portions and prices meshed just right which made the experience even better. Whether on a date or hanging out with your friends, you&apos;ll enjoy the sociable atmosphere."

Our server was Xavier and we found out he was very new to the job. He was friendly and very attentive. ALL of the staff were friendly and attentive. I don&apos;t think my water glass ever went below the halfway mark. Everyone was wearing a big smile and I love seeing that. Makes the whole experience that much more memorable :) 

Anyhoo, I had to write about this spot again because it&apos;s so good and you need to check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"This should&apos;ve been a 5 star review :( 
But unfortunately the service was sub par. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat. I loved that they played old R&amp;B hits. It&apos;s not your typical sushi spot. 

The food was great! Full of flavor and they offer &quot;black&quot; rice which I&apos;ve never heard of before! But apparently it&apos;s the healthiest rice known to man and really good! 

However, we waited over an hour for our food to be served and 30 minutes for every round of drinks we ordered. We started off buying sake by the bottle ..our waitress informed us that there were only two bottles of the Sake we were drinking. We told her we&apos;d take both but  wanted the second bottle to be served after the first bottle. When it was time for the second bottle our waitress disappeared or 45 minutes only to return and inform us that she couldn&apos;t find it. *eye roll* So we ended up switching to tequila but again had to wait 30 minutes just to receive our drinks. 

Overall, great food. Shit service. Enter at your own risk :)"
5,"Dropped in for happy hour and what a treat!  The Whiskey Boy is a great cocktail. Add some of the small bites and you&apos;ll be happy. The miso salmon is amazing and the Buffalo duck wing is AWESOME!  The staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Stop by!"
4,"A large group of us came here for dinner before a night out. It was really good and they offered a lot of specials! We just so happened to come during happy hour which had great food and drink deals.

We initially thought this place was similar to korean bbq but found that they just had a list of meat you can get grilled by the chef&apos;s at the bbq bar. A lot of us took advantage of the happy hour deals that included sushi, meat sticks, and moscow mules. The sushi was delicious!

I really liked the decor and vibe of the restaurant!"
5,Union Sushi + BBQ Bar never fails. I love their calamari so that&apos;s always a must for me. I tried the black rice sushi yesterday. Initially I was nervous but it&apos;s very good. It taste the same to me AND it&apos;s healthier. Why not? I definitely recommend the sampler. My favorite was the Hokkaido. The Devon is a sweet potato roll. Do not be intimidated. It&apos;s amazing!
2,"Ordered Shrimp Tempura, Bristol Bay, and Bay Street California rolls and seaweed salad for delivery. 

Delivery packaging - not very temper proof. The sticker on the paper bag wasn&apos;t placed properly, I wouldn&apos;t even know if the food was tempered with.

Food - the rolls are super small, and average tasting at best. Rice didn&apos;t taste fresh, the ingredients inside all 3 rolls were bland. The only one I thought was okay was the Bay Street California, which had crab cake inside. Overall over-priced, and not worth it. 

Seaweed salad - you really can&apos;t mess this one up, but the one I got severely lacked seasoning/rice vinegar, and was dry. Luckily I had some at home, and I had to put in quite a bit.

I&apos;ve dined once before and wasn&apos;t impressed either, but thought I&apos;d give it another try during quarantine. Conclusion, it&apos;s still a no-go for me."
5,"Lively atmosphere with basic sushi rolls and not so basic rolls. They gave us complimentary appetizers and also a special treat at the end of the meal (dessert) as it was our anniversary. 

I really love this place. It&apos;s not overly pretentious but also not a place you&apos;d go wearing gym clothes. Ambiance really is spot on.

The only disappointment was that I made an open table reservation and they didn&apos;t validate my reservation so I could get my points? Weird.

Our server was on point. I&apos;d come here again if I were in town."
3,"My friend and I came here for a late dinner, and despite it being a weekday and late, the place was decently crowded. We had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we hurriedly ordered. Our server was attentive and nice throughout our meal.

Old city market roll (4/5): This roll didn&apos;t have rice in it?! Maybe I should be glad that a bigger proportion of the roll was fish, but I still missed the familiarity of rice in a roll ready to absorb soy sauce and tying everything together.

Saba nigiri (5/5): mackerel is my favorite fish in nigiri, so I usually order it when I&apos;m at a sushi restaurant, and it didn&apos;t disappoint!

Duck yaki soba (3/5): This was soup-less noodles and was described as having tonkatsu sauce in it, but I found it quite dry. It had decent flavor and a nice spicy kick to it, but there were pieces of pepper in it where the skin of the pepper felt really tough and almost inedible. I left the dish almost untouched."
4,My husbands favorite place. My favorites are the coconut gelato because it has crispy coco flakes and it goes well with the gelato. Uni soba with ikura is unbeatable. They have good quality sushi and different type of rice like black rice. Oysters is ok to have but picture looks better than taste. I love crispy calamari but they can make it better because it&apos;s small cuts ( looks like those low quality frozen calamari) and lost the texture of it and it&apos;s lack of flavor.
4,"TLDR
Happy Hour menu items = solid, Old City Market maki, seafood ramen, robata skewers and crab legs. 

GETTING THERE
With its flashy red neon sign, Union is difficult to miss heading down Franklin. There&apos;s plenty of meter parking along the sidewalk, but the Chicago brown line is just a couple blocks north. Might be a probably the better option on a busy night. 

FARE
They have got unique and adventurous ramen selection. While our table set it a goal for each person to order different bowl of ramen, the server decided to step in and steer us to the right direction of choosing spicy pigtail or seafood ramen instead of the beef cheek as they are the most popular bowls in house. Thanks for looking out for us! Just a heads up, the uni alfredo soba is much smaller than the rest of the ramen bowls. The uni and suck sobas are dry while the other ramen counterparts are soup based. 

Union surely has you covered with the full Japanese cuisine experience. Ranging from colorful ramen, sushi, salads, appetizers, robata grill, there&apos;s surely something for everyone! I surely anticipate my next visit to try the rest of their menu."
4,"They&apos;re sushi never disappoints. It&apos;s flavorful and fresh but way too expensive for an eight piece roll compared to other restaurant. I also tried the oysters but as someone who loves the pure oyster flavor, the toppings over powered each one. It left me wishing the toppings were on the side so I can add my own amount. 

The ambiance is what I like most. It&apos;s a very trendy location and they play great old r&amp;b and hip hop choices. It&apos;s a solid choice that typically isn&apos;t too busy. In addition, they have great Moscow miles on happy hour for $5 which tasted great despite the lack of liquor in it."
5,"I wanted to try this place for years, and never got a chance. With COVID dining became takeout and delivery only, so I decided to give this place a try. 

Their eel rolls were excellent. Perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked. We tried several other rolls and all of them were cooked to perfection. I did not have a chance to try their BBQ, but I am looking forward to it. This place gets a five-star rating for their quality of food and nice seating area. I can&apos;t wait to actually dine in."
5,"We loved our time at Union. Husband got the pork cutlet (because he&apos;s scared of ) and I tried the black rice sushi roll sampler. The Hokkaido roll was by far my favorite on the sampler--scallop, avocado, jalapeño wrapped in soy paper. The Devon is made with sweet potato and had great flavor and a surprising crunch to it. I&apos;ve not had black rice sushi before--don&apos;t let that scare you off because it&apos;s delicious!

Don&apos;t skip dessert! The Chocolate Crunch Mousse was so light and fluffy. 

For COVID, they have barriers up between all of the tables. Serving food and drinks on single use disposable dishes (except the soy sauce) and silverware. Staff is all wearing masks and gloves."
5,"What a great experience!  A unique menu, for sure! 

Our table ordered cauliflower salad, a mushroom roll, miso soup, tempura platter and the pork belly. Everything was awesome. We had one little problem and the corrected the plate and it was perfect! 

Service was excellent and was provided by Vina. During this pandemic it also feels like this business has gone over and above to be cautious. 

Thank you."
4,"I was excited to try this place after passing it several times and had a good experience overall. The outdoor seating is nice, except for the noise of the El right above.

We started with the lychee martinis, which were strong and delicious. I loved the two fresh lychees, although they were not as sweet and ripe as I would have liked. 

The highlight of the black sushi sampler was definitely the scallop sushi. It was beautiful and delicious. It also included some of the best sweet potato tempura sushi I&apos;ve had. The tuna sushi was good, but could have used some crunch or another element. 

We also got the BBQ chicken. I was surprised to find that it was very reminiscent of an Indian curry, rather than the Japanese BBQ I was expecting. It was good, although maybe not the first thing I would order again. 

Overall, this was a good experience. The service is friendly and I really enjoyed changing it up with the black rice sushi. I might not be back right away, especially considering the higher price, but I would definitely consider coming back again."
5,"Had a dinner reservation in February during All Star Weekend. 

It&apos;s a great atmosphere. Our waiter, Javier was great! He was very pleasant and he knew the menu very well! Everything he recommended was on point! The portions are perfect and delicious!

We took advantage of some of the specials, I had two Moscow mules and my husband had Sake. I was pleasantly surprised by the oysters! They are a must try! Trust me, you&apos;ll not be disappointed! 

We really enjoy our visit and will be going back for sure!"
4,"We came here for dinner and enjoyed the service and environment. We ordered in sharing fashion so we could sample more than less. Our sushi selections consisted of the Shrimp Tempura Roll and Smoked Salmon Nigiri which was pretty fresh. We also got the Truffle Ahí Tuna and the Miso salmon. I had a Tequila Moscow Mule that had a generous portion of liquor so no complaints there. Portions and prices meshed just right which made the experience even better. Whether on a date or hanging out with your friends, you&apos;ll enjoy the sociable atmosphere."
4,"Came for the $5 happy hour moscow mules, stayed for the delicious black rice bay street cali rolls. 

Union was a great recommendation from a local friend who works in the area. My 3 pals and I came here before a concert and luckily were able to sneak in at 6pm, with 30 minutes left to spare for happy hour. 

We ordered a round of moscow mules for the table. They have a few different varieties - one of my pals go the tequila variation, while I got the gin, and our two other friends got the original. Yum, yum, yum! Since happy hour was almost over, we got a few of these at once. 

My one friend and I split the happy hour oysters ($1.50/each HH price) and as a table we split two orders of the spicy shrimp rolls ($6 HH price). I loved both, but especially the spicy shrimp rolls. 

For my main entree, I got the black rice bay street cali roll. Different than most cali rolls, I&apos;ve had in the past, one of the main reasons being because of the black rice (subbed it for the supposed health benefits), and the other reason being because it had more flavor than other cali rolls. I&apos;d say this was the highlight of my dinner!

Service for the most part was great! He did forget to bring our spicy mayo, but other than that, he was always on top of our drink and food orders. 

Union is dark, romantic, and modern. Perfect for any occasion, birthday, date night, or even a weekday dinner. I&apos;d love to come back again to try more of their menu!"
5,"I ended up coming here for lunch the other day as my coworker had recommended it!

Let me tell you, the lamb chops are DELICIOUS!

A baby arugula salad comes with the lamb chops and it was simply delicious. It is a small plate, so if you are really hungry you would want to get something else to go with it. 

The ambiance and service was great!

I am looking forward to coming back here and trying  some of the other dishes.

Check it out and let me know what you think!"
3,"Awesome service and very good sushi. Nothing over the top amazing, just good. Music is loud and lights bright but The host did dim  the lights on my behalf which I greatly appreciated. This is a very Covid friendly place with all the precautions that will make you feel really safe and comfortable.  I have very high standards for sushi that&apos;s the three stars but I think most people really enjoy the spot perfectly if you&apos;re young."
5,"Happy hour, happy hour, where do we go!? I was meeting a friend after work to catch up over happy hour and was craving the bay street cali roll so we had to come here. Not to mention the amazing happy hour that they have from 5-6:30PM daily and we made it by 5:30 so we were IN in to WIN it. 

Their Happy Hour Menu is:
 $1.50 Oysters
 $3 Beef Filet Skewers
 $6 Spicy Shrimp Sushi Rolls
 $10 Truffled Tuna
 $5 Glasses of Rose
 $5 Moscow Mules
Half Price Sake

I got the Moscow mule and my friend got the Rose and we both loved our drinks. The complimentary edamame is also a nice touch once you sit down. The bay street cali roll was as amazing as ever. The homemade crab cake literally melts in your mouth and I got an extra side of the spicy mayo because, obviously. I also tried something new. They have black rice! I was hesitant at first but it&apos;s healthier and was recommended, so why not? I liked it and has a bit sweeter taste.

I&apos;ve dined once before and wasn&apos;t impressed either, but thought I&apos;d give it another try during quarantine. Conclusion, it&apos;s still a no-go for me."
5,"Lively atmosphere with basic sushi rolls and not so basic rolls. They gave us complimentary appetizers and also a special treat at the end of the meal (dessert) as it was our anniversary. 

I really love this place. It&apos;s not overly pretentious but also not a place you&apos;d go wearing gym clothes. Ambiance really is spot on.

The only disappointment was that I made an open table reservation and they didn&apos;t validate my reservation so I could get my points? Weird.

Our server was on point. I&apos;d come here again if I were in town."
3,"My friend and I came here for a late dinner, and despite it being a weekday and late, the place was decently crowded. We had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we hurriedly ordered. Our server was attentive and nice throughout our meal.

Old city market roll (4/5): This roll didn&apos;t have rice in it?! Maybe I should be glad that a bigger proportion of the roll was fish, but I still missed the familiarity of rice in a roll ready to absorb soy sauce and tying everything together.

Saba nigiri (5/5): mackerel is my favorite fish in nigiri, so I usually order it when I&apos;m at a sushi restaurant, and it didn&apos;t disappoint!

Duck yaki soba (3/5): This was soup-less noodles and was described as having tonkatsu sauce in it, but I found it quite dry. It had decent flavor and a nice spicy kick to it, but there were pieces of pepper in it where the skin of the pepper felt really tough and almost inedible. I left the dish almost untouched."
4,My husbands favorite place. My favorites are the coconut gelato because it has crispy coco flakes and it goes well with the gelato. Uni soba with ikura is unbeatable. They have good quality sushi and different type of rice like black rice. Oysters is ok to have but picture looks better than taste. I love crispy calamari but they can make it better because it&apos;s small cuts ( looks like those low quality frozen calamari) and lost the texture of it and it&apos;s lack of flavor.
4,"TLDR
Happy Hour menu items = solid, Old City Market maki, seafood ramen, robata skewers and crab legs. 

GETTING THERE
With its flashy red neon sign, Union is difficult to miss heading down Franklin. There&apos;s plenty of meter parking along the sidewalk, but the Chicago brown line is just a couple blocks north. Might be a probably the better option on a busy night. 

FARE
They have got unique and adventurous ramen selection. While our table set it a goal for each person to order different bowl of ramen, the server decided to step in and steer us to the right direction of choosing spicy pigtail or seafood ramen instead of the beef cheek as they are the most popular bowls in house. Thanks for looking out for us! Just a heads up, the uni alfredo soba is much smaller than the rest of the ramen bowls. The uni and suck sobas are dry while the other ramen counterparts are soup based. 

Union surely has you covered with the full Japanese cuisine experience. Ranging from colorful ramen, sushi, salads, appetizers, robata grill, there&apos;s surely something for everyone! I surely anticipate my next visit to try the rest of their menu."
4,"They&apos;re sushi never disappoints. It&apos;s flavorful and fresh but way too expensive for an eight piece roll compared to other restaurant. I also tried the oysters but as someone who loves the pure oyster flavor, the toppings over powered each one. It left me wishing the toppings were on the side so I can add my own amount. 

The ambiance is what I like most. It&apos;s a very trendy location and they play great old r&amp;b and hip hop choices. It&apos;s a solid choice that typically isn&apos;t too busy. In addition, they have great Moscow miles on happy hour for $5 which tasted great despite the lack of liquor in it."
5,"I wanted to try this place for years, and never got a chance. With COVID dining became takeout and delivery only, so I decided to give this place a try. 

Their eel rolls were excellent. Perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked. We tried several other rolls and all of them were cooked to perfection. I did not have a chance to try their BBQ, but I am looking forward to it. This place gets a five-star rating for their quality of food and nice seating area. I can&apos;t wait to actually dine in."
5,"We loved our time at Union. Husband got the pork cutlet (because he&apos;s scared of ) and I tried the black rice sushi roll sampler. The Hokkaido roll was by far my favorite on the sampler--scallop, avocado, jalapeño wrapped in soy paper. The Devon is made with sweet potato and had great flavor and a surprising crunch to it. I&apos;ve not had black rice sushi before--don&apos;t let that scare you off because it&apos;s delicious!

Don&apos;t skip dessert! The Chocolate Crunch Mousse was so light and fluffy. 

For COVID, they have barriers up between all of the tables. Serving food and drinks on single use disposable dishes (except the soy sauce) and silverware. Staff is all wearing masks and gloves."
5,"What a great experience!  A unique menu, for sure! 

Our table ordered cauliflower salad, a mushroom roll, miso soup, tempura platter and the pork belly. Everything was awesome. We had one little problem and the corrected the plate and it was perfect! 

Service was excellent and was provided by Vina. During this pandemic it also feels like this business has gone over and above to be cautious. 

Thank you."
4,"I was excited to try this place after passing it several times and had a good experience overall. The outdoor seating is nice, except for the noise of the El right above.

We started with the lychee martinis, which were strong and delicious. I loved the two fresh lychees, although they were not as sweet and ripe as I would have liked. 

The highlight of the black sushi sampler was definitely the scallop sushi. It was beautiful and delicious. It also included some of the best sweet potato tempura sushi I&apos;ve had. The tuna sushi was good, but could have used some crunch or another element. 

We also got the BBQ chicken. I was surprised to find that it was very reminiscent of an Indian curry, rather than the Japanese BBQ I was expecting. It was good, although maybe not the first thing I would order again. 

Overall, this was a good experience. The service is friendly and I really enjoyed changing it up with the black rice sushi. I might not be back right away, especially considering the higher price, but I would definitely consider coming back again."
5,"Had a dinner reservation in February during All Star Weekend. 

It&apos;s a great atmosphere. Our waiter, Javier was great! He was very pleasant and he knew the menu very well! Everything he recommended was on point! The portions are perfect and delicious!

We took advantage of some of the specials, I had two Moscow mules and my husband had Sake. I was pleasantly surprised by the oysters! They are a must try! Trust me, you&apos;ll not be disappointed! 

We really enjoy our visit and will be going back for sure!"
4,"We came here for dinner and enjoyed the service and environment. We ordered in sharing fashion so we could sample more than less. Our sushi selections consisted of the Shrimp Tempura Roll and Smoked Salmon Nigiri which was pretty fresh. We also got the Truffle Ahí Tuna and the Miso salmon. I had a Tequila Moscow Mule that had a generous portion of liquor so no complaints there. Portions and prices meshed just right which made the experience even better. Whether on a date or hanging out with your friends, you&apos;ll enjoy the sociable atmosphere."
4,"Came for the $5 happy hour moscow mules, stayed for the delicious black rice bay street cali rolls. 

Union was a great recommendation from a local friend who works in the area. My 3 pals and I came here before a concert and luckily were able to sneak in at 6pm, with 30 minutes left to spare for happy hour. 

We ordered a round of moscow mules for the table. They have a few different varieties - one of my pals go the tequila variation, while I got the gin, and our two other friends got the original. Yum, yum, yum! Since happy hour was almost over, we got a few of these at once. 

My one friend and I split the happy hour oysters ($1.50/each HH price) and as a table we split two orders of the spicy shrimp rolls ($6 HH price). I loved both, but especially the spicy shrimp rolls. 

For my main entree, I got the black rice bay street cali roll. Different than most cali rolls, I&apos;ve had in the past, one of the main reasons being because of the black rice (subbed it for the supposed health benefits), and the other reason being because it had more flavor than other cali rolls. I&apos;d say this was the highlight of my dinner!

Service for the most part was great! He did forget to bring our spicy mayo, but other than that, he was always on top of our drink and food orders. 

Union is dark, romantic, and modern. Perfect for any occasion, birthday, date night, or even a weekday dinner. I&apos;d love to come back again to try more of their menu!"
5,"I ended up coming here for lunch the other day as my coworker had recommended it!

Let me tell you, the lamb chops are DELICIOUS!

A baby arugula salad comes with the lamb chops and it was simply delicious. It is a small plate, so if you are really hungry you would want to get something else to go with it. 

The ambiance and service was great!

I am looking forward to coming back here and trying  some of the other dishes.

Check it out and let me know what you think!"
3,"Awesome service and very good sushi. Nothing over the top amazing, just good. Music is loud and lights bright but The host did dim  the lights on my behalf which I greatly appreciated. This is a very Covid friendly place with all the precautions that will make you feel really safe and comfortable.  I have very high standards for sushi that&apos;s the three stars but I think most people really enjoy the spot perfectly if you&apos;re young."
5,"Happy hour, happy hour, where do we go!? I was meeting a friend after work to catch up over happy hour and was craving the bay street cali roll so we had to come here. Not to mention the amazing happy hour that they have from 5-6:30PM daily and we made it by 5:30 so we were IN in to WIN it. 

Their Happy Hour Menu is:
 $1.50 Oysters
 $3 Beef Filet Skewers
 $6 Spicy Shrimp Sushi Rolls
 $10 Truffled Tuna
 $5 Glasses of Rose
 $5 Moscow Mules
Half Price Sake

I got the Moscow mule and my friend got the Rose and we both loved our drinks. The complimentary edamame is also a nice touch once you sit down. The bay street cali roll was as amazing as ever. The homemade crab cake literally melts in your mouth and I got an extra side of the spicy mayo because, obviously. I also tried something new. They have black rice! I was hesitant at first but it&apos;s healthier and was recommended, so why not? I liked it and has a bit sweeter taste.

I also ordered the chicken ramen. This bowl is HUGE. I took half it home because it was so big. I enjoyed the red pepper flake garlic oil and I&apos;ll know next time if I order this it is fully sufficient for an entire meal.

Our server was Xavier and we found out he was very new to the job. He was friendly and very attentive. ALL of the staff were friendly and attentive. I don&apos;t think my water glass ever went below the halfway mark. Everyone was wearing a big smile and I love seeing that. Makes the whole experience that much more memorable :) 

Anyhoo, I had to write about this spot again because it&apos;s so good and you need to check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"This should&apos;ve been a 5 star review :( 
But unfortunately the service was sub par. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat. I loved that they played old R&amp;B hits. It&apos;s not your typical sushi spot. 

The food was great! Full of flavor and they offer &quot;black&quot; rice which I&apos;ve never heard of before! But apparently it&apos;s the healthiest rice known to man and really good! 

However, we waited over an hour for our food to be served and 30 minutes for every round of drinks we ordered. We started off buying sake by the bottle ..our waitress informed us that there were only two bottles of the Sake we were drinking. We told her we&apos;d take both but  wanted the second bottle to be served after the first bottle. When it was time for the second bottle our waitress disappeared or 45 minutes only to return and inform us that she couldn&apos;t find it. *eye roll* So we ended up switching to tequila but again had to wait 30 minutes just to receive our drinks. 

Overall, great food. Shit service. Enter at your own risk :)"
5,"Dropped in for happy hour and what a treat!  The Whiskey Boy is a great cocktail. Add some of the small bites and you&apos;ll be happy. The miso salmon is amazing and the Buffalo duck wing is AWESOME!  The staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Stop by!"
4,"A large group of us came here for dinner before a night out. It was really good and they offered a lot of specials! We just so happened to come during happy hour which had great food and drink deals.

We initially thought this place was similar to korean bbq but found that they just had a list of meat you can get grilled by the chef&apos;s at the bbq bar. A lot of us took advantage of the happy hour deals that included sushi, meat sticks, and moscow mules. The sushi was delicious!

I really liked the decor and vibe of the restaurant!"
5,Union Sushi + BBQ Bar never fails. I love their calamari so that&apos;s always a must for me. I tried the black rice sushi yesterday. Initially I was nervous but it&apos;s very good. It taste the same to me AND it&apos;s healthier. Why not? I definitely recommend the sampler. My favorite was the Hokkaido. The Devon is a sweet potato roll. Do not be intimidated. It&apos;s amazing!
2,"Ordered Shrimp Tempura, Bristol Bay, and Bay Street California rolls and seaweed salad for delivery. 

Delivery packaging - not very temper proof. The sticker on the paper bag wasn&apos;t placed properly, I wouldn&apos;t even know if the food was tempered with.

4,"They&apos;re sushi never disappoints. It&apos;s flavorful and fresh but way too expensive for an eight piece roll compared to other restaurant. I also tried the oysters but as someone who loves the pure oyster flavor, the toppings over powered each one. It left me wishing the toppings were on the side so I can add my own amount. 

The ambiance is what I like most. It&apos;s a very trendy location and they play great old r&amp;b and hip hop choices. It&apos;s a solid choice that typically isn&apos;t too busy. In addition, they have great Moscow miles on happy hour for $5 which tasted great despite the lack of liquor in it."
5,"I wanted to try this place for years, and never got a chance. With COVID dining became takeout and delivery only, so I decided to give this place a try. 

Their eel rolls were excellent. Perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked. We tried several other rolls and all of them were cooked to perfection. I did not have a chance to try their BBQ, but I am looking forward to it. This place gets a five-star rating for their quality of food and nice seating area. I can&apos;t wait to actually dine in."
5,"We loved our time at Union. Husband got the pork cutlet (because he&apos;s scared of ) and I tried the black rice sushi roll sampler. The Hokkaido roll was by far my favorite on the sampler--scallop, avocado, jalapeño wrapped in soy paper. The Devon is made with sweet potato and had great flavor and a surprising crunch to it. I&apos;ve not had black rice sushi before--don&apos;t let that scare you off because it&apos;s delicious!

Don&apos;t skip dessert! The Chocolate Crunch Mousse was so light and fluffy. 

For COVID, they have barriers up between all of the tables. Serving food and drinks on single use disposable dishes (except the soy sauce) and silverware. Staff is all wearing masks and gloves."
5,"What a great experience!  A unique menu, for sure! 

Our table ordered cauliflower salad, a mushroom roll, miso soup, tempura platter and the pork belly. Everything was awesome. We had one little problem and the corrected the plate and it was perfect! 

Service was excellent and was provided by Vina. During this pandemic it also feels like this business has gone over and above to be cautious. 

Thank you."
4,"I was excited to try this place after passing it several times and had a good experience overall. The outdoor seating is nice, except for the noise of the El right above.

We started with the lychee martinis, which were strong and delicious. I loved the two fresh lychees, although they were not as sweet and ripe as I would have liked. 

The highlight of the black sushi sampler was definitely the scallop sushi. It was beautiful and delicious. It also included some of the best sweet potato tempura sushi I&apos;ve had. The tuna sushi was good, but could have used some crunch or another element. 

We also got the BBQ chicken. I was surprised to find that it was very reminiscent of an Indian curry, rather than the Japanese BBQ I was expecting. It was good, although maybe not the first thing I would order again. 

Overall, this was a good experience. The service is friendly and I really enjoyed changing it up with the black rice sushi. I might not be back right away, especially considering the higher price, but I would definitely consider coming back again."
5,"Had a dinner reservation in February during All Star Weekend. 

It&apos;s a great atmosphere. Our waiter, Javier was great! He was very pleasant and he knew the menu very well! Everything he recommended was on point! The portions are perfect and delicious!

We took advantage of some of the specials, I had two Moscow mules and my husband had Sake. I was pleasantly surprised by the oysters! They are a must try! Trust me, you&apos;ll not be disappointed! 

We really enjoy our visit and will be going back for sure!"
4,"We came here for dinner and enjoyed the service and environment. We ordered in sharing fashion so we could sample more than less. Our sushi selections consisted of the Shrimp Tempura Roll and Smoked Salmon Nigiri which was pretty fresh. We also got the Truffle Ahí Tuna and the Miso salmon. I had a Tequila Moscow Mule that had a generous portion of liquor so no complaints there. Portions and prices meshed just right which made the experience even better. Whether on a date or hanging out with your friends, you&apos;ll enjoy the sociable atmosphere."
4,"Came for the $5 happy hour moscow mules, stayed for the delicious black rice bay street cali rolls. 

Union was a great recommendation from a local friend who works in the area. My 3 pals and I came here before a concert and luckily were able to sneak in at 6pm, with 30 minutes left to spare for happy hour. 

We ordered a round of moscow mules for the table. They have a few different varieties - one of my pals go the tequila variation, while I got the gin, and our two other friends got the original. Yum, yum, yum! Since happy hour was almost over, we got a few of these at once. 

My one friend and I split the happy hour oysters ($1.50/each HH price) and as a table we split two orders of the spicy shrimp rolls ($6 HH price). I loved both, but especially the spicy shrimp rolls. 

For my main entree, I got the black rice bay street cali roll. Different than most cali rolls, I&apos;ve had in the past, one of the main reasons being because of the black rice (subbed it for the supposed health benefits), and the other reason being because it had more flavor than other cali rolls. I&apos;d say this was the highlight of my dinner!

Service for the most part was great! He did forget to bring our spicy mayo, but other than that, he was always on top of our drink and food orders. 

Union is dark, romantic, and modern. Perfect for any occasion, birthday, date night, or even a weekday dinner. I&apos;d love to come back again to try more of their menu!"
5,"I ended up coming here for lunch the other day as my coworker had recommended it!

Let me tell you, the lamb chops are DELICIOUS!

A baby arugula salad comes with the lamb chops and it was simply delicious. It is a small plate, so if you are really hungry you would want to get something else to go with it. 

The ambiance and service was great!

I am looking forward to coming back here and trying  some of the other dishes.

Check it out and let me know what you think!"
3,"Awesome service and very good sushi. Nothing over the top amazing, just good. Music is loud and lights bright but The host did dim  the lights on my behalf which I greatly appreciated. This is a very Covid friendly place with all the precautions that will make you feel really safe and comfortable.  I have very high standards for sushi that&apos;s the three stars but I think most people really enjoy the spot perfectly if you&apos;re young."
5,"Happy hour, happy hour, where do we go!? I was meeting a friend after work to catch up over happy hour and was craving the bay street cali roll so we had to come here. Not to mention the amazing happy hour that they have from 5-6:30PM daily and we made it by 5:30 so we were IN in to WIN it. 

Their Happy Hour Menu is:
 $1.50 Oysters
 $3 Beef Filet Skewers
 $6 Spicy Shrimp Sushi Rolls
 $10 Truffled Tuna
 $5 Glasses of Rose
 $5 Moscow Mules
Half Price Sake

I got the Moscow mule and my friend got the Rose and we both loved our drinks. The complimentary edamame is also a nice touch once you sit down. The bay street cali roll was as amazing as ever. The homemade crab cake literally melts in your mouth and I got an extra side of the spicy mayo because, obviously. I also tried something new. They have black rice! I was hesitant at first but it&apos;s healthier and was recommended, so why not? I liked it and has a bit sweeter taste.

I also ordered the chicken ramen. This bowl is HUGE. I took half it home because it was so big. I enjoyed the red pepper flake garlic oil and I&apos;ll know next time if I order this it is fully sufficient for an entire meal.

Our server was Xavier and we found out he was very new to the job. He was friendly and very attentive. ALL of the staff were friendly and attentive. I don&apos;t think my water glass ever went below the halfway mark. Everyone was wearing a big smile and I love seeing that. Makes the whole experience that much more memorable :) 

Anyhoo, I had to write about this spot again because it&apos;s so good and you need to check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"This should&apos;ve been a 5 star review :( 
But unfortunately the service was sub par. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat. I loved that they played old R&amp;B hits. It&apos;s not your typical sushi spot. 

The food was great! Full of flavor and they offer &quot;black&quot; rice which I&apos;ve never heard of before! But apparently it&apos;s the healthiest rice known to man and really good! 

However, we waited over an hour for our food to be served and 30 minutes for every round of drinks we ordered. We started off buying sake by the bottle ..our waitress informed us that there were only two bottles of the Sake we were drinking. We told her we&apos;d take both but  wanted the second bottle to be served after the first bottle. When it was time for the second bottle our waitress disappeared or 45 minutes only to return and inform us that she couldn&apos;t find it. *eye roll* So we ended up switching to tequila but again had to wait 30 minutes just to receive our drinks. 

Overall, great food. Shit service. Enter at your own risk :)"
5,"Dropped in for happy hour and what a treat!  The Whiskey Boy is a great cocktail. Add some of the small bites and you&apos;ll be happy. The miso salmon is amazing and the Buffalo duck wing is AWESOME!  The staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Stop by!"
4,"A large group of us came here for dinner before a night out. It was really good and they offered a lot of specials! We just so happened to come during happy hour which had great food and drink deals.

We initially thought this place was similar to korean bbq but found that they just had a list of meat you can get grilled by the chef&apos;s at the bbq bar. A lot of us took advantage of the happy hour deals that included sushi, meat sticks, and moscow mules. The sushi was delicious!

I really liked the decor and vibe of the restaurant!"
5,Union Sushi + BBQ Bar never fails. I love their calamari so that&apos;s always a must for me. I tried the black rice sushi yesterday. Initially I was nervous but it&apos;s very good. It taste the same to me AND it&apos;s healthier. Why not? I definitely recommend the sampler. My favorite was the Hokkaido. The Devon is a sweet potato roll. Do not be intimidated. It&apos;s amazing!
2,"Ordered Shrimp Tempura, Bristol Bay, and Bay Street California rolls and seaweed salad for delivery. 

Delivery packaging - not very temper proof. The sticker on the paper bag wasn&apos;t placed properly, I wouldn&apos;t even know if the food was tempered with.

Food - the rolls are super small, and average tasting at best. Rice didn&apos;t taste fresh, the ingredients inside all 3 rolls were bland. The only one I thought was okay was the Bay Street California, which had crab cake inside. Overall over-priced, and not worth it. 

Seaweed salad - you really can&apos;t mess this one up, but the one I got severely lacked seasoning/rice vinegar, and was dry. Luckily I had some at home, and I had to put in quite a bit.

I&apos;ve dined once before and wasn&apos;t impressed either, but thought I&apos;d give it another try during quarantine. Conclusion, it&apos;s still a no-go for me."
5,"Lively atmosphere with basic sushi rolls and not so basic rolls. They gave us complimentary appetizers and also a special treat at the end of the meal (dessert) as it was our anniversary. 

I really love this place. It&apos;s not overly pretentious but also not a place you&apos;d go wearing gym clothes. Ambiance really is spot on.

The only disappointment was that I made an open table reservation and they didn&apos;t validate my reservation so I could get my points? Weird.

Our server was on point. I&apos;d come here again if I were in town."
3,"My friend and I came here for a late dinner, and despite it being a weekday and late, the place was decently crowded. We had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we hurriedly ordered. Our server was attentive and nice throughout our meal.

Old city market roll (4/5): This roll didn&apos;t have rice in it?! Maybe I should be glad that a bigger proportion of the roll was fish, but I still missed the familiarity of rice in a roll ready to absorb soy sauce and tying everything together.

Saba nigiri (5/5): mackerel is my favorite fish in nigiri, so I usually order it when I&apos;m at a sushi restaurant, and it didn&apos;t disappoint!

Duck yaki soba (3/5): This was soup-less noodles and was described as having tonkatsu sauce in it, but I found it quite dry. It had decent flavor and a nice spicy kick to it, but there were pieces of pepper in it where the skin of the pepper felt really tough and almost inedible. I left the dish almost untouched."
4,My husbands favorite place. My favorites are the coconut gelato because it has crispy coco flakes and it goes well with the gelato. Uni soba with ikura is unbeatable. They have good quality sushi and different type of rice like black rice. Oysters is ok to have but picture looks better than taste. I love crispy calamari but they can make it better because it&apos;s small cuts ( looks like those low quality frozen calamari) and lost the texture of it and it&apos;s lack of flavor.
4,"TLDR
Happy Hour menu items = solid, Old City Market maki, seafood ramen, robata skewers and crab legs. 

GETTING THERE
With its flashy red neon sign, Union is difficult to miss heading down Franklin. There&apos;s plenty of meter parking along the sidewalk, but the Chicago brown line is just a couple blocks north. Might be a probably the better option on a busy night. 

FARE
They have got unique and adventurous ramen selection. While our table set it a goal for each person to order different bowl of ramen, the server decided to step in and steer us to the right direction of choosing spicy pigtail or seafood ramen instead of the beef cheek as they are the most popular bowls in house. Thanks for looking out for us! Just a heads up, the uni alfredo soba is much smaller than the rest of the ramen bowls. The uni and suck sobas are dry while the other ramen counterparts are soup based. 

Union surely has you covered with the full Japanese cuisine experience. Ranging from colorful ramen, sushi, salads, appetizers, robata grill, there&apos;s surely something for everyone! I surely anticipate my next visit to try the rest of their menu."

We took advantage of some of the specials, I had two Moscow mules and my husband had Sake. I was pleasantly surprised by the oysters! They are a must try! Trust me, you&apos;ll not be disappointed! 

We really enjoy our visit and will be going back for sure!"
4,"We came here for dinner and enjoyed the service and environment. We ordered in sharing fashion so we could sample more than less. Our sushi selections consisted of the Shrimp Tempura Roll and Smoked Salmon Nigiri which was pretty fresh. We also got the Truffle Ahí Tuna and the Miso salmon. I had a Tequila Moscow Mule that had a generous portion of liquor so no complaints there. Portions and prices meshed just right which made the experience even better. Whether on a date or hanging out with your friends, you&apos;ll enjoy the sociable atmosphere."
4,"Came for the $5 happy hour moscow mules, stayed for the delicious black rice bay street cali rolls. 

Union was a great recommendation from a local friend who works in the area. My 3 pals and I came here before a concert and luckily were able to sneak in at 6pm, with 30 minutes left to spare for happy hour. 

We ordered a round of moscow mules for the table. They have a few different varieties - one of my pals go the tequila variation, while I got the gin, and our two other friends got the original. Yum, yum, yum! Since happy hour was almost over, we got a few of these at once. 

My one friend and I split the happy hour oysters ($1.50/each HH price) and as a table we split two orders of the spicy shrimp rolls ($6 HH price). I loved both, but especially the spicy shrimp rolls. 

For my main entree, I got the black rice bay street cali roll. Different than most cali rolls, I&apos;ve had in the past, one of the main reasons being because of the black rice (subbed it for the supposed health benefits), and the other reason being because it had more flavor than other cali rolls. I&apos;d say this was the highlight of my dinner!

Service for the most part was great! He did forget to bring our spicy mayo, but other than that, he was always on top of our drink and food orders. 

Union is dark, romantic, and modern. Perfect for any occasion, birthday, date night, or even a weekday dinner. I&apos;d love to come back again to try more of their menu!"
5,"I ended up coming here for lunch the other day as my coworker had recommended it!

Let me tell you, the lamb chops are DELICIOUS!

A baby arugula salad comes with the lamb chops and it was simply delicious. It is a small plate, so if you are really hungry you would want to get something else to go with it. 

The ambiance and service was great!

I am looking forward to coming back here and trying  some of the other dishes.

Check it out and let me know what you think!"
3,"Awesome service and very good sushi. Nothing over the top amazing, just good. Music is loud and lights bright but The host did dim  the lights on my behalf which I greatly appreciated. This is a very Covid friendly place with all the precautions that will make you feel really safe and comfortable.  I have very high standards for sushi that&apos;s the three stars but I think most people really enjoy the spot perfectly if you&apos;re young."
5,"Happy hour, happy hour, where do we go!? I was meeting a friend after work to catch up over happy hour and was craving the bay street cali roll so we had to come here. Not to mention the amazing happy hour that they have from 5-6:30PM daily and we made it by 5:30 so we were IN in to WIN it. 

Their Happy Hour Menu is:
 $1.50 Oysters
 $3 Beef Filet Skewers
 $6 Spicy Shrimp Sushi Rolls
 $10 Truffled Tuna
 $5 Glasses of Rose
 $5 Moscow Mules
Half Price Sake

I got the Moscow mule and my friend got the Rose and we both loved our drinks. The complimentary edamame is also a nice touch once you sit down. The bay street cali roll was as amazing as ever. The homemade crab cake literally melts in your mouth and I got an extra side of the spicy mayo because, obviously. I also tried something new. They have black rice! I was hesitant at first but it&apos;s healthier and was recommended, so why not? I liked it and has a bit sweeter taste.

I also ordered the chicken ramen. This bowl is HUGE. I took half it home because it was so big. I enjoyed the red pepper flake garlic oil and I&apos;ll know next time if I order this it is fully sufficient for an entire meal.

Our server was Xavier and we found out he was very new to the job. He was friendly and very attentive. ALL of the staff were friendly and attentive. I don&apos;t think my water glass ever went below the halfway mark. Everyone was wearing a big smile and I love seeing that. Makes the whole experience that much more memorable :) 

Anyhoo, I had to write about this spot again because it&apos;s so good and you need to check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"This should&apos;ve been a 5 star review :( 
But unfortunately the service was sub par. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat. I loved that they played old R&amp;B hits. It&apos;s not your typical sushi spot. 

The food was great! Full of flavor and they offer &quot;black&quot; rice which I&apos;ve never heard of before! But apparently it&apos;s the healthiest rice known to man and really good! 

However, we waited over an hour for our food to be served and 30 minutes for every round of drinks we ordered. We started off buying sake by the bottle ..our waitress informed us that there were only two bottles of the Sake we were drinking. We told her we&apos;d take both but  wanted the second bottle to be served after the first bottle. When it was time for the second bottle our waitress disappeared or 45 minutes only to return and inform us that she couldn&apos;t find it. *eye roll* So we ended up switching to tequila but again had to wait 30 minutes just to receive our drinks. 

Overall, great food. Shit service. Enter at your own risk :)"
5,"Dropped in for happy hour and what a treat!  The Whiskey Boy is a great cocktail. Add some of the small bites and you&apos;ll be happy. The miso salmon is amazing and the Buffalo duck wing is AWESOME!  The staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Stop by!"
4,"A large group of us came here for dinner before a night out. It was really good and they offered a lot of specials! We just so happened to come during happy hour which had great food and drink deals.

We initially thought this place was similar to korean bbq but found that they just had a list of meat you can get grilled by the chef&apos;s at the bbq bar. A lot of us took advantage of the happy hour deals that included sushi, meat sticks, and moscow mules. The sushi was delicious!

I really liked the decor and vibe of the restaurant!"
5,Union Sushi + BBQ Bar never fails. I love their calamari so that&apos;s always a must for me. I tried the black rice sushi yesterday. Initially I was nervous but it&apos;s very good. It taste the same to me AND it&apos;s healthier. Why not? I definitely recommend the sampler. My favorite was the Hokkaido. The Devon is a sweet potato roll. Do not be intimidated. It&apos;s amazing!
2,"Ordered Shrimp Tempura, Bristol Bay, and Bay Street California rolls and seaweed salad for delivery. 

Delivery packaging - not very temper proof. The sticker on the paper bag wasn&apos;t placed properly, I wouldn&apos;t even know if the food was tempered with.

Food - the rolls are super small, and average tasting at best. Rice didn&apos;t taste fresh, the ingredients inside all 3 rolls were bland. The only one I thought was okay was the Bay Street California, which had crab cake inside. Overall over-priced, and not worth it. 

Seaweed salad - you really can&apos;t mess this one up, but the one I got severely lacked seasoning/rice vinegar, and was dry. Luckily I had some at home, and I had to put in quite a bit.

I&apos;ve dined once before and wasn&apos;t impressed either, but thought I&apos;d give it another try during quarantine. Conclusion, it&apos;s still a no-go for me."
5,"Lively atmosphere with basic sushi rolls and not so basic rolls. They gave us complimentary appetizers and also a special treat at the end of the meal (dessert) as it was our anniversary. 

I really love this place. It&apos;s not overly pretentious but also not a place you&apos;d go wearing gym clothes. Ambiance really is spot on.

The only disappointment was that I made an open table reservation and they didn&apos;t validate my reservation so I could get my points? Weird.

Our server was on point. I&apos;d come here again if I were in town."
3,"My friend and I came here for a late dinner, and despite it being a weekday and late, the place was decently crowded. We had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we hurriedly ordered. Our server was attentive and nice throughout our meal.

Old city market roll (4/5): This roll didn&apos;t have rice in it?! Maybe I should be glad that a bigger proportion of the roll was fish, but I still missed the familiarity of rice in a roll ready to absorb soy sauce and tying everything together.

Saba nigiri (5/5): mackerel is my favorite fish in nigiri, so I usually order it when I&apos;m at a sushi restaurant, and it didn&apos;t disappoint!

Duck yaki soba (3/5): This was soup-less noodles and was described as having tonkatsu sauce in it, but I found it quite dry. It had decent flavor and a nice spicy kick to it, but there were pieces of pepper in it where the skin of the pepper felt really tough and almost inedible. I left the dish almost untouched."
4,My husbands favorite place. My favorites are the coconut gelato because it has crispy coco flakes and it goes well with the gelato. Uni soba with ikura is unbeatable. They have good quality sushi and different type of rice like black rice. Oysters is ok to have but picture looks better than taste. I love crispy calamari but they can make it better because it&apos;s small cuts ( looks like those low quality frozen calamari) and lost the texture of it and it&apos;s lack of flavor.
4,"TLDR
Happy Hour menu items = solid, Old City Market maki, seafood ramen, robata skewers and crab legs. 

GETTING THERE
With its flashy red neon sign, Union is difficult to miss heading down Franklin. There&apos;s plenty of meter parking along the sidewalk, but the Chicago brown line is just a couple blocks north. Might be a probably the better option on a busy night. 

FARE
They have got unique and adventurous ramen selection. While our table set it a goal for each person to order different bowl of ramen, the server decided to step in and steer us to the right direction of choosing spicy pigtail or seafood ramen instead of the beef cheek as they are the most popular bowls in house. Thanks for looking out for us! Just a heads up, the uni alfredo soba is much smaller than the rest of the ramen bowls. The uni and suck sobas are dry while the other ramen counterparts are soup based. 

Union surely has you covered with the full Japanese cuisine experience. Ranging from colorful ramen, sushi, salads, appetizers, robata grill, there&apos;s surely something for everyone! I surely anticipate my next visit to try the rest of their menu."
4,"They&apos;re sushi never disappoints. It&apos;s flavorful and fresh but way too expensive for an eight piece roll compared to other restaurant. I also tried the oysters but as someone who loves the pure oyster flavor, the toppings over powered each one. It left me wishing the toppings were on the side so I can add my own amount. 

The ambiance is what I like most. It&apos;s a very trendy location and they play great old r&amp;b and hip hop choices. It&apos;s a solid choice that typically isn&apos;t too busy. In addition, they have great Moscow miles on happy hour for $5 which tasted great despite the lack of liquor in it."
5,"I wanted to try this place for years, and never got a chance. With COVID dining became takeout and delivery only, so I decided to give this place a try. 

Their eel rolls were excellent. Perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked. We tried several other rolls and all of them were cooked to perfection. I did not have a chance to try their BBQ, but I am looking forward to it. This place gets a five-star rating for their quality of food and nice seating area. I can&apos;t wait to actually dine in."
5,"We loved our time at Union. Husband got the pork cutlet (because he&apos;s scared of ) and I tried the black rice sushi roll sampler. The Hokkaido roll was by far my favorite on the sampler--scallop, avocado, jalapeño wrapped in soy paper. The Devon is made with sweet potato and had great flavor and a surprising crunch to it. I&apos;ve not had black rice sushi before--don&apos;t let that scare you off because it&apos;s delicious!

Don&apos;t skip dessert! The Chocolate Crunch Mousse was so light and fluffy. 

For COVID, they have barriers up between all of the tables. Serving food and drinks on single use disposable dishes (except the soy sauce) and silverware. Staff is all wearing masks and gloves."
5,"What a great experience!  A unique menu, for sure! 

Our table ordered cauliflower salad, a mushroom roll, miso soup, tempura platter and the pork belly. Everything was awesome. We had one little problem and the corrected the plate and it was perfect! 

Service was excellent and was provided by Vina. During this pandemic it also feels like this business has gone over and above to be cautious. 

Thank you."
4,"I was excited to try this place after passing it several times and had a good experience overall. The outdoor seating is nice, except for the noise of the El right above.

We started with the lychee martinis, which were strong and delicious. I loved the two fresh lychees, although they were not as sweet and ripe as I would have liked. 

The highlight of the black sushi sampler was definitely the scallop sushi. It was beautiful and delicious. It also included some of the best sweet potato tempura sushi I&apos;ve had. The tuna sushi was good, but could have used some crunch or another element. 

We also got the BBQ chicken. I was surprised to find that it was very reminiscent of an Indian curry, rather than the Japanese BBQ I was expecting. It was good, although maybe not the first thing I would order again. 

Overall, this was a good experience. The service is friendly and I really enjoyed changing it up with the black rice sushi. I might not be back right away, especially considering the higher price, but I would definitely consider coming back again."

 $3 Beef Filet Skewers
 $6 Spicy Shrimp Sushi Rolls
 $10 Truffled Tuna
 $5 Glasses of Rose
 $5 Moscow Mules
Half Price Sake

I got the Moscow mule and my friend got the Rose and we both loved our drinks. The complimentary edamame is also a nice touch once you sit down. The bay street cali roll was as amazing as ever. The homemade crab cake literally melts in your mouth and I got an extra side of the spicy mayo because, obviously. I also tried something new. They have black rice! I was hesitant at first but it&apos;s healthier and was recommended, so why not? I liked it and has a bit sweeter taste.

I also ordered the chicken ramen. This bowl is HUGE. I took half it home because it was so big. I enjoyed the red pepper flake garlic oil and I&apos;ll know next time if I order this it is fully sufficient for an entire meal.

Our server was Xavier and we found out he was very new to the job. He was friendly and very attentive. ALL of the staff were friendly and attentive. I don&apos;t think my water glass ever went below the halfway mark. Everyone was wearing a big smile and I love seeing that. Makes the whole experience that much more memorable :) 

Anyhoo, I had to write about this spot again because it&apos;s so good and you need to check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"This should&apos;ve been a 5 star review :( 
But unfortunately the service was sub par. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat. I loved that they played old R&amp;B hits. It&apos;s not your typical sushi spot. 

The food was great! Full of flavor and they offer &quot;black&quot; rice which I&apos;ve never heard of before! But apparently it&apos;s the healthiest rice known to man and really good! 

However, we waited over an hour for our food to be served and 30 minutes for every round of drinks we ordered. We started off buying sake by the bottle ..our waitress informed us that there were only two bottles of the Sake we were drinking. We told her we&apos;d take both but  wanted the second bottle to be served after the first bottle. When it was time for the second bottle our waitress disappeared or 45 minutes only to return and inform us that she couldn&apos;t find it. *eye roll* So we ended up switching to tequila but again had to wait 30 minutes just to receive our drinks. 

Overall, great food. Shit service. Enter at your own risk :)"
5,"Dropped in for happy hour and what a treat!  The Whiskey Boy is a great cocktail. Add some of the small bites and you&apos;ll be happy. The miso salmon is amazing and the Buffalo duck wing is AWESOME!  The staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Stop by!"
4,"A large group of us came here for dinner before a night out. It was really good and they offered a lot of specials! We just so happened to come during happy hour which had great food and drink deals.

We initially thought this place was similar to korean bbq but found that they just had a list of meat you can get grilled by the chef&apos;s at the bbq bar. A lot of us took advantage of the happy hour deals that included sushi, meat sticks, and moscow mules. The sushi was delicious!

I really liked the decor and vibe of the restaurant!"
5,Union Sushi + BBQ Bar never fails. I love their calamari so that&apos;s always a must for me. I tried the black rice sushi yesterday. Initially I was nervous but it&apos;s very good. It taste the same to me AND it&apos;s healthier. Why not? I definitely recommend the sampler. My favorite was the Hokkaido. The Devon is a sweet potato roll. Do not be intimidated. It&apos;s amazing!
2,"Ordered Shrimp Tempura, Bristol Bay, and Bay Street California rolls and seaweed salad for delivery. 

Delivery packaging - not very temper proof. The sticker on the paper bag wasn&apos;t placed properly, I wouldn&apos;t even know if the food was tempered with.

Food - the rolls are super small, and average tasting at best. Rice didn&apos;t taste fresh, the ingredients inside all 3 rolls were bland. The only one I thought was okay was the Bay Street California, which had crab cake inside. Overall over-priced, and not worth it. 

Seaweed salad - you really can&apos;t mess this one up, but the one I got severely lacked seasoning/rice vinegar, and was dry. Luckily I had some at home, and I had to put in quite a bit.

I&apos;ve dined once before and wasn&apos;t impressed either, but thought I&apos;d give it another try during quarantine. Conclusion, it&apos;s still a no-go for me."
5,"Lively atmosphere with basic sushi rolls and not so basic rolls. They gave us complimentary appetizers and also a special treat at the end of the meal (dessert) as it was our anniversary. 

I really love this place. It&apos;s not overly pretentious but also not a place you&apos;d go wearing gym clothes. Ambiance really is spot on.

The only disappointment was that I made an open table reservation and they didn&apos;t validate my reservation so I could get my points? Weird.

Our server was on point. I&apos;d come here again if I were in town."
3,"My friend and I came here for a late dinner, and despite it being a weekday and late, the place was decently crowded. We had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we hurriedly ordered. Our server was attentive and nice throughout our meal.

Old city market roll (4/5): This roll didn&apos;t have rice in it?! Maybe I should be glad that a bigger proportion of the roll was fish, but I still missed the familiarity of rice in a roll ready to absorb soy sauce and tying everything together.

Saba nigiri (5/5): mackerel is my favorite fish in nigiri, so I usually order it when I&apos;m at a sushi restaurant, and it didn&apos;t disappoint!

Duck yaki soba (3/5): This was soup-less noodles and was described as having tonkatsu sauce in it, but I found it quite dry. It had decent flavor and a nice spicy kick to it, but there were pieces of pepper in it where the skin of the pepper felt really tough and almost inedible. I left the dish almost untouched."
4,My husbands favorite place. My favorites are the coconut gelato because it has crispy coco flakes and it goes well with the gelato. Uni soba with ikura is unbeatable. They have good quality sushi and different type of rice like black rice. Oysters is ok to have but picture looks better than taste. I love crispy calamari but they can make it better because it&apos;s small cuts ( looks like those low quality frozen calamari) and lost the texture of it and it&apos;s lack of flavor.
4,"TLDR
Happy Hour menu items = solid, Old City Market maki, seafood ramen, robata skewers and crab legs. 

GETTING THERE
With its flashy red neon sign, Union is difficult to miss heading down Franklin. There&apos;s plenty of meter parking along the sidewalk, but the Chicago brown line is just a couple blocks north. Might be a probably the better option on a busy night. 

FARE
They have got unique and adventurous ramen selection. While our table set it a goal for each person to order different bowl of ramen, the server decided to step in and steer us to the right direction of choosing spicy pigtail or seafood ramen instead of the beef cheek as they are the most popular bowls in house. Thanks for looking out for us! Just a heads up, the uni alfredo soba is much smaller than the rest of the ramen bowls. The uni and suck sobas are dry while the other ramen counterparts are soup based. 

Union surely has you covered with the full Japanese cuisine experience. Ranging from colorful ramen, sushi, salads, appetizers, robata grill, there&apos;s surely something for everyone! I surely anticipate my next visit to try the rest of their menu."
4,"They&apos;re sushi never disappoints. It&apos;s flavorful and fresh but way too expensive for an eight piece roll compared to other restaurant. I also tried the oysters but as someone who loves the pure oyster flavor, the toppings over powered each one. It left me wishing the toppings were on the side so I can add my own amount. 

The ambiance is what I like most. It&apos;s a very trendy location and they play great old r&amp;b and hip hop choices. It&apos;s a solid choice that typically isn&apos;t too busy. In addition, they have great Moscow miles on happy hour for $5 which tasted great despite the lack of liquor in it."
5,"I wanted to try this place for years, and never got a chance. With COVID dining became takeout and delivery only, so I decided to give this place a try. 

Their eel rolls were excellent. Perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked. We tried several other rolls and all of them were cooked to perfection. I did not have a chance to try their BBQ, but I am looking forward to it. This place gets a five-star rating for their quality of food and nice seating area. I can&apos;t wait to actually dine in."
5,"We loved our time at Union. Husband got the pork cutlet (because he&apos;s scared of ) and I tried the black rice sushi roll sampler. The Hokkaido roll was by far my favorite on the sampler--scallop, avocado, jalapeño wrapped in soy paper. The Devon is made with sweet potato and had great flavor and a surprising crunch to it. I&apos;ve not had black rice sushi before--don&apos;t let that scare you off because it&apos;s delicious!

Don&apos;t skip dessert! The Chocolate Crunch Mousse was so light and fluffy. 

For COVID, they have barriers up between all of the tables. Serving food and drinks on single use disposable dishes (except the soy sauce) and silverware. Staff is all wearing masks and gloves."
5,"What a great experience!  A unique menu, for sure! 

Our table ordered cauliflower salad, a mushroom roll, miso soup, tempura platter and the pork belly. Everything was awesome. We had one little problem and the corrected the plate and it was perfect! 

Service was excellent and was provided by Vina. During this pandemic it also feels like this business has gone over and above to be cautious. 

Thank you."
4,"I was excited to try this place after passing it several times and had a good experience overall. The outdoor seating is nice, except for the noise of the El right above.

We started with the lychee martinis, which were strong and delicious. I loved the two fresh lychees, although they were not as sweet and ripe as I would have liked. 

The highlight of the black sushi sampler was definitely the scallop sushi. It was beautiful and delicious. It also included some of the best sweet potato tempura sushi I&apos;ve had. The tuna sushi was good, but could have used some crunch or another element. 

We also got the BBQ chicken. I was surprised to find that it was very reminiscent of an Indian curry, rather than the Japanese BBQ I was expecting. It was good, although maybe not the first thing I would order again. 

Overall, this was a good experience. The service is friendly and I really enjoyed changing it up with the black rice sushi. I might not be back right away, especially considering the higher price, but I would definitely consider coming back again."
5,"Had a dinner reservation in February during All Star Weekend. 

It&apos;s a great atmosphere. Our waiter, Javier was great! He was very pleasant and he knew the menu very well! Everything he recommended was on point! The portions are perfect and delicious!

We took advantage of some of the specials, I had two Moscow mules and my husband had Sake. I was pleasantly surprised by the oysters! They are a must try! Trust me, you&apos;ll not be disappointed! 

We really enjoy our visit and will be going back for sure!"
4,"We came here for dinner and enjoyed the service and environment. We ordered in sharing fashion so we could sample more than less. Our sushi selections consisted of the Shrimp Tempura Roll and Smoked Salmon Nigiri which was pretty fresh. We also got the Truffle Ahí Tuna and the Miso salmon. I had a Tequila Moscow Mule that had a generous portion of liquor so no complaints there. Portions and prices meshed just right which made the experience even better. Whether on a date or hanging out with your friends, you&apos;ll enjoy the sociable atmosphere."
4,"Came for the $5 happy hour moscow mules, stayed for the delicious black rice bay street cali rolls. 

Union was a great recommendation from a local friend who works in the area. My 3 pals and I came here before a concert and luckily were able to sneak in at 6pm, with 30 minutes left to spare for happy hour. 

We ordered a round of moscow mules for the table. They have a few different varieties - one of my pals go the tequila variation, while I got the gin, and our two other friends got the original. Yum, yum, yum! Since happy hour was almost over, we got a few of these at once. 

My one friend and I split the happy hour oysters ($1.50/each HH price) and as a table we split two orders of the spicy shrimp rolls ($6 HH price). I loved both, but especially the spicy shrimp rolls. 

For my main entree, I got the black rice bay street cali roll. Different than most cali rolls, I&apos;ve had in the past, one of the main reasons being because of the black rice (subbed it for the supposed health benefits), and the other reason being because it had more flavor than other cali rolls. I&apos;d say this was the highlight of my dinner!

Service for the most part was great! He did forget to bring our spicy mayo, but other than that, he was always on top of our drink and food orders. 

Union is dark, romantic, and modern. Perfect for any occasion, birthday, date night, or even a weekday dinner. I&apos;d love to come back again to try more of their menu!"
5,"I ended up coming here for lunch the other day as my coworker had recommended it!

Let me tell you, the lamb chops are DELICIOUS!

A baby arugula salad comes with the lamb chops and it was simply delicious. It is a small plate, so if you are really hungry you would want to get something else to go with it. 

The ambiance and service was great!

I am looking forward to coming back here and trying  some of the other dishes.

Check it out and let me know what you think!"
3,"Awesome service and very good sushi. Nothing over the top amazing, just good. Music is loud and lights bright but The host did dim  the lights on my behalf which I greatly appreciated. This is a very Covid friendly place with all the precautions that will make you feel really safe and comfortable.  I have very high standards for sushi that&apos;s the three stars but I think most people really enjoy the spot perfectly if you&apos;re young."
5,"Happy hour, happy hour, where do we go!? I was meeting a friend after work to catch up over happy hour and was craving the bay street cali roll so we had to come here. Not to mention the amazing happy hour that they have from 5-6:30PM daily and we made it by 5:30 so we were IN in to WIN it.

Delivery packaging - not very temper proof. The sticker on the paper bag wasn&apos;t placed properly, I wouldn&apos;t even know if the food was tempered with.

Food - the rolls are super small, and average tasting at best. Rice didn&apos;t taste fresh, the ingredients inside all 3 rolls were bland. The only one I thought was okay was the Bay Street California, which had crab cake inside. Overall over-priced, and not worth it. 

Seaweed salad - you really can&apos;t mess this one up, but the one I got severely lacked seasoning/rice vinegar, and was dry. Luckily I had some at home, and I had to put in quite a bit.

I&apos;ve dined once before and wasn&apos;t impressed either, but thought I&apos;d give it another try during quarantine. Conclusion, it&apos;s still a no-go for me."
5,"Lively atmosphere with basic sushi rolls and not so basic rolls. They gave us complimentary appetizers and also a special treat at the end of the meal (dessert) as it was our anniversary. 

I really love this place. It&apos;s not overly pretentious but also not a place you&apos;d go wearing gym clothes. Ambiance really is spot on.

The only disappointment was that I made an open table reservation and they didn&apos;t validate my reservation so I could get my points? Weird.

Our server was on point. I&apos;d come here again if I were in town."
3,"My friend and I came here for a late dinner, and despite it being a weekday and late, the place was decently crowded. We had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we hurriedly ordered. Our server was attentive and nice throughout our meal.

Old city market roll (4/5): This roll didn&apos;t have rice in it?! Maybe I should be glad that a bigger proportion of the roll was fish, but I still missed the familiarity of rice in a roll ready to absorb soy sauce and tying everything together.

Saba nigiri (5/5): mackerel is my favorite fish in nigiri, so I usually order it when I&apos;m at a sushi restaurant, and it didn&apos;t disappoint!

Duck yaki soba (3/5): This was soup-less noodles and was described as having tonkatsu sauce in it, but I found it quite dry. It had decent flavor and a nice spicy kick to it, but there were pieces of pepper in it where the skin of the pepper felt really tough and almost inedible. I left the dish almost untouched."
4,My husbands favorite place. My favorites are the coconut gelato because it has crispy coco flakes and it goes well with the gelato. Uni soba with ikura is unbeatable. They have good quality sushi and different type of rice like black rice. Oysters is ok to have but picture looks better than taste. I love crispy calamari but they can make it better because it&apos;s small cuts ( looks like those low quality frozen calamari) and lost the texture of it and it&apos;s lack of flavor.
4,"TLDR
Happy Hour menu items = solid, Old City Market maki, seafood ramen, robata skewers and crab legs. 

GETTING THERE
With its flashy red neon sign, Union is difficult to miss heading down Franklin. There&apos;s plenty of meter parking along the sidewalk, but the Chicago brown line is just a couple blocks north. Might be a probably the better option on a busy night. 

FARE
They have got unique and adventurous ramen selection. While our table set it a goal for each person to order different bowl of ramen, the server decided to step in and steer us to the right direction of choosing spicy pigtail or seafood ramen instead of the beef cheek as they are the most popular bowls in house. Thanks for looking out for us! Just a heads up, the uni alfredo soba is much smaller than the rest of the ramen bowls. The uni and suck sobas are dry while the other ramen counterparts are soup based. 

Union surely has you covered with the full Japanese cuisine experience. Ranging from colorful ramen, sushi, salads, appetizers, robata grill, there&apos;s surely something for everyone! I surely anticipate my next visit to try the rest of their menu."
4,"They&apos;re sushi never disappoints. It&apos;s flavorful and fresh but way too expensive for an eight piece roll compared to other restaurant. I also tried the oysters but as someone who loves the pure oyster flavor, the toppings over powered each one. It left me wishing the toppings were on the side so I can add my own amount. 

The ambiance is what I like most. It&apos;s a very trendy location and they play great old r&amp;b and hip hop choices. It&apos;s a solid choice that typically isn&apos;t too busy. In addition, they have great Moscow miles on happy hour for $5 which tasted great despite the lack of liquor in it."
5,"I wanted to try this place for years, and never got a chance. With COVID dining became takeout and delivery only, so I decided to give this place a try. 

Their eel rolls were excellent. Perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked. We tried several other rolls and all of them were cooked to perfection. I did not have a chance to try their BBQ, but I am looking forward to it. This place gets a five-star rating for their quality of food and nice seating area. I can&apos;t wait to actually dine in."
5,"We loved our time at Union. Husband got the pork cutlet (because he&apos;s scared of ) and I tried the black rice sushi roll sampler. The Hokkaido roll was by far my favorite on the sampler--scallop, avocado, jalapeño wrapped in soy paper. The Devon is made with sweet potato and had great flavor and a surprising crunch to it. I&apos;ve not had black rice sushi before--don&apos;t let that scare you off because it&apos;s delicious!

Don&apos;t skip dessert! The Chocolate Crunch Mousse was so light and fluffy. 

For COVID, they have barriers up between all of the tables. Serving food and drinks on single use disposable dishes (except the soy sauce) and silverware. Staff is all wearing masks and gloves."
5,"What a great experience!  A unique menu, for sure! 

Our table ordered cauliflower salad, a mushroom roll, miso soup, tempura platter and the pork belly. Everything was awesome. We had one little problem and the corrected the plate and it was perfect! 

Service was excellent and was provided by Vina. During this pandemic it also feels like this business has gone over and above to be cautious. 

Thank you."
4,"I was excited to try this place after passing it several times and had a good experience overall. The outdoor seating is nice, except for the noise of the El right above.

We started with the lychee martinis, which were strong and delicious. I loved the two fresh lychees, although they were not as sweet and ripe as I would have liked. 

The highlight of the black sushi sampler was definitely the scallop sushi. It was beautiful and delicious. It also included some of the best sweet potato tempura sushi I&apos;ve had. The tuna sushi was good, but could have used some crunch or another element. 

We also got the BBQ chicken. I was surprised to find that it was very reminiscent of an Indian curry, rather than the Japanese BBQ I was expecting. It was good, although maybe not the first thing I would order again. 

Overall, this was a good experience. The service is friendly and I really enjoyed changing it up with the black rice sushi. I might not be back right away, especially considering the higher price, but I would definitely consider coming back again."
5,"Had a dinner reservation in February during All Star Weekend. 

It&apos;s a great atmosphere. Our waiter, Javier was great! He was very pleasant and he knew the menu very well! Everything he recommended was on point! The portions are perfect and delicious!

We took advantage of some of the specials, I had two Moscow mules and my husband had Sake. I was pleasantly surprised by the oysters! They are a must try! Trust me, you&apos;ll not be disappointed! 

We really enjoy our visit and will be going back for sure!"
4,"We came here for dinner and enjoyed the service and environment. We ordered in sharing fashion so we could sample more than less. Our sushi selections consisted of the Shrimp Tempura Roll and Smoked Salmon Nigiri which was pretty fresh. We also got the Truffle Ahí Tuna and the Miso salmon. I had a Tequila Moscow Mule that had a generous portion of liquor so no complaints there. Portions and prices meshed just right which made the experience even better. Whether on a date or hanging out with your friends, you&apos;ll enjoy the sociable atmosphere."
4,"Came for the $5 happy hour moscow mules, stayed for the delicious black rice bay street cali rolls. 

Union was a great recommendation from a local friend who works in the area. My 3 pals and I came here before a concert and luckily were able to sneak in at 6pm, with 30 minutes left to spare for happy hour. 

We ordered a round of moscow mules for the table. They have a few different varieties - one of my pals go the tequila variation, while I got the gin, and our two other friends got the original. Yum, yum, yum! Since happy hour was almost over, we got a few of these at once. 

My one friend and I split the happy hour oysters ($1.50/each HH price) and as a table we split two orders of the spicy shrimp rolls ($6 HH price). I loved both, but especially the spicy shrimp rolls. 

For my main entree, I got the black rice bay street cali roll. Different than most cali rolls, I&apos;ve had in the past, one of the main reasons being because of the black rice (subbed it for the supposed health benefits), and the other reason being because it had more flavor than other cali rolls. I&apos;d say this was the highlight of my dinner!

Service for the most part was great! He did forget to bring our spicy mayo, but other than that, he was always on top of our drink and food orders. 

Union is dark, romantic, and modern. Perfect for any occasion, birthday, date night, or even a weekday dinner. I&apos;d love to come back again to try more of their menu!"
5,"I ended up coming here for lunch the other day as my coworker had recommended it!

Let me tell you, the lamb chops are DELICIOUS!

A baby arugula salad comes with the lamb chops and it was simply delicious. It is a small plate, so if you are really hungry you would want to get something else to go with it. 

The ambiance and service was great!

I am looking forward to coming back here and trying  some of the other dishes.

Check it out and let me know what you think!"
3,"Awesome service and very good sushi. Nothing over the top amazing, just good. Music is loud and lights bright but The host did dim  the lights on my behalf which I greatly appreciated. This is a very Covid friendly place with all the precautions that will make you feel really safe and comfortable.  I have very high standards for sushi that&apos;s the three stars but I think most people really enjoy the spot perfectly if you&apos;re young."
5,"Happy hour, happy hour, where do we go!? I was meeting a friend after work to catch up over happy hour and was craving the bay street cali roll so we had to come here. Not to mention the amazing happy hour that they have from 5-6:30PM daily and we made it by 5:30 so we were IN in to WIN it. 

Their Happy Hour Menu is:
 $1.50 Oysters
 $3 Beef Filet Skewers
 $6 Spicy Shrimp Sushi Rolls
 $10 Truffled Tuna
 $5 Glasses of Rose
 $5 Moscow Mules
Half Price Sake

I got the Moscow mule and my friend got the Rose and we both loved our drinks. The complimentary edamame is also a nice touch once you sit down. The bay street cali roll was as amazing as ever. The homemade crab cake literally melts in your mouth and I got an extra side of the spicy mayo because, obviously. I also tried something new. They have black rice! I was hesitant at first but it&apos;s healthier and was recommended, so why not? I liked it and has a bit sweeter taste.

I also ordered the chicken ramen. This bowl is HUGE. I took half it home because it was so big. I enjoyed the red pepper flake garlic oil and I&apos;ll know next time if I order this it is fully sufficient for an entire meal.

Our server was Xavier and we found out he was very new to the job. He was friendly and very attentive. ALL of the staff were friendly and attentive. I don&apos;t think my water glass ever went below the halfway mark. Everyone was wearing a big smile and I love seeing that. Makes the whole experience that much more memorable :) 

Anyhoo, I had to write about this spot again because it&apos;s so good and you need to check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"This should&apos;ve been a 5 star review :( 
But unfortunately the service was sub par. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat. I loved that they played old R&amp;B hits. It&apos;s not your typical sushi spot. 

The food was great! Full of flavor and they offer &quot;black&quot; rice which I&apos;ve never heard of before! But apparently it&apos;s the healthiest rice known to man and really good! 

However, we waited over an hour for our food to be served and 30 minutes for every round of drinks we ordered. We started off buying sake by the bottle ..our waitress informed us that there were only two bottles of the Sake we were drinking. We told her we&apos;d take both but  wanted the second bottle to be served after the first bottle. When it was time for the second bottle our waitress disappeared or 45 minutes only to return and inform us that she couldn&apos;t find it. *eye roll* So we ended up switching to tequila but again had to wait 30 minutes just to receive our drinks. 

Overall, great food. Shit service. Enter at your own risk :)"
5,"Dropped in for happy hour and what a treat!  The Whiskey Boy is a great cocktail. Add some of the small bites and you&apos;ll be happy. The miso salmon is amazing and the Buffalo duck wing is AWESOME!  The staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Stop by!"
4,"A large group of us came here for dinner before a night out. It was really good and they offered a lot of specials! We just so happened to come during happy hour which had great food and drink deals.

We initially thought this place was similar to korean bbq but found that they just had a list of meat you can get grilled by the chef&apos;s at the bbq bar. A lot of us took advantage of the happy hour deals that included sushi, meat sticks, and moscow mules. The sushi was delicious!

I really liked the decor and vibe of the restaurant!"
5,Union Sushi + BBQ Bar never fails. I love their calamari so that&apos;s always a must for me. I tried the black rice sushi yesterday. Initially I was nervous but it&apos;s very good. It taste the same to me AND it&apos;s healthier. Why not? I definitely recommend the sampler. My favorite was the Hokkaido. The Devon is a sweet potato roll. Do not be intimidated. It&apos;s amazing!

Union surely has you covered with the full Japanese cuisine experience. Ranging from colorful ramen, sushi, salads, appetizers, robata grill, there&apos;s surely something for everyone! I surely anticipate my next visit to try the rest of their menu."
4,"They&apos;re sushi never disappoints. It&apos;s flavorful and fresh but way too expensive for an eight piece roll compared to other restaurant. I also tried the oysters but as someone who loves the pure oyster flavor, the toppings over powered each one. It left me wishing the toppings were on the side so I can add my own amount. 

The ambiance is what I like most. It&apos;s a very trendy location and they play great old r&amp;b and hip hop choices. It&apos;s a solid choice that typically isn&apos;t too busy. In addition, they have great Moscow miles on happy hour for $5 which tasted great despite the lack of liquor in it."
5,"I wanted to try this place for years, and never got a chance. With COVID dining became takeout and delivery only, so I decided to give this place a try. 

Their eel rolls were excellent. Perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked. We tried several other rolls and all of them were cooked to perfection. I did not have a chance to try their BBQ, but I am looking forward to it. This place gets a five-star rating for their quality of food and nice seating area. I can&apos;t wait to actually dine in."
5,"We loved our time at Union. Husband got the pork cutlet (because he&apos;s scared of ) and I tried the black rice sushi roll sampler. The Hokkaido roll was by far my favorite on the sampler--scallop, avocado, jalapeño wrapped in soy paper. The Devon is made with sweet potato and had great flavor and a surprising crunch to it. I&apos;ve not had black rice sushi before--don&apos;t let that scare you off because it&apos;s delicious!

Don&apos;t skip dessert! The Chocolate Crunch Mousse was so light and fluffy. 

For COVID, they have barriers up between all of the tables. Serving food and drinks on single use disposable dishes (except the soy sauce) and silverware. Staff is all wearing masks and gloves."
5,"What a great experience!  A unique menu, for sure! 

Our table ordered cauliflower salad, a mushroom roll, miso soup, tempura platter and the pork belly. Everything was awesome. We had one little problem and the corrected the plate and it was perfect! 

Service was excellent and was provided by Vina. During this pandemic it also feels like this business has gone over and above to be cautious. 

Thank you."
4,"I was excited to try this place after passing it several times and had a good experience overall. The outdoor seating is nice, except for the noise of the El right above.

We started with the lychee martinis, which were strong and delicious. I loved the two fresh lychees, although they were not as sweet and ripe as I would have liked. 

The highlight of the black sushi sampler was definitely the scallop sushi. It was beautiful and delicious. It also included some of the best sweet potato tempura sushi I&apos;ve had. The tuna sushi was good, but could have used some crunch or another element. 

We also got the BBQ chicken. I was surprised to find that it was very reminiscent of an Indian curry, rather than the Japanese BBQ I was expecting. It was good, although maybe not the first thing I would order again. 

Overall, this was a good experience. The service is friendly and I really enjoyed changing it up with the black rice sushi. I might not be back right away, especially considering the higher price, but I would definitely consider coming back again."
5,"Had a dinner reservation in February during All Star Weekend. 

It&apos;s a great atmosphere. Our waiter, Javier was great! He was very pleasant and he knew the menu very well! Everything he recommended was on point! The portions are perfect and delicious!

We took advantage of some of the specials, I had two Moscow mules and my husband had Sake. I was pleasantly surprised by the oysters! They are a must try! Trust me, you&apos;ll not be disappointed! 

We really enjoy our visit and will be going back for sure!"
4,"We came here for dinner and enjoyed the service and environment. We ordered in sharing fashion so we could sample more than less. Our sushi selections consisted of the Shrimp Tempura Roll and Smoked Salmon Nigiri which was pretty fresh. We also got the Truffle Ahí Tuna and the Miso salmon. I had a Tequila Moscow Mule that had a generous portion of liquor so no complaints there. Portions and prices meshed just right which made the experience even better. Whether on a date or hanging out with your friends, you&apos;ll enjoy the sociable atmosphere."
4,"Came for the $5 happy hour moscow mules, stayed for the delicious black rice bay street cali rolls. 

Union was a great recommendation from a local friend who works in the area. My 3 pals and I came here before a concert and luckily were able to sneak in at 6pm, with 30 minutes left to spare for happy hour. 

We ordered a round of moscow mules for the table. They have a few different varieties - one of my pals go the tequila variation, while I got the gin, and our two other friends got the original. Yum, yum, yum! Since happy hour was almost over, we got a few of these at once. 

My one friend and I split the happy hour oysters ($1.50/each HH price) and as a table we split two orders of the spicy shrimp rolls ($6 HH price). I loved both, but especially the spicy shrimp rolls. 

For my main entree, I got the black rice bay street cali roll. Different than most cali rolls, I&apos;ve had in the past, one of the main reasons being because of the black rice (subbed it for the supposed health benefits), and the other reason being because it had more flavor than other cali rolls. I&apos;d say this was the highlight of my dinner!

Service for the most part was great! He did forget to bring our spicy mayo, but other than that, he was always on top of our drink and food orders. 

Union is dark, romantic, and modern. Perfect for any occasion, birthday, date night, or even a weekday dinner. I&apos;d love to come back again to try more of their menu!"
5,"I ended up coming here for lunch the other day as my coworker had recommended it!

Let me tell you, the lamb chops are DELICIOUS!

A baby arugula salad comes with the lamb chops and it was simply delicious. It is a small plate, so if you are really hungry you would want to get something else to go with it. 

The ambiance and service was great!

I am looking forward to coming back here and trying  some of the other dishes.

Check it out and let me know what you think!"
3,"Awesome service and very good sushi. Nothing over the top amazing, just good. Music is loud and lights bright but The host did dim  the lights on my behalf which I greatly appreciated. This is a very Covid friendly place with all the precautions that will make you feel really safe and comfortable.  I have very high standards for sushi that&apos;s the three stars but I think most people really enjoy the spot perfectly if you&apos;re young."
5,"Happy hour, happy hour, where do we go!? I was meeting a friend after work to catch up over happy hour and was craving the bay street cali roll so we had to come here. Not to mention the amazing happy hour that they have from 5-6:30PM daily and we made it by 5:30 so we were IN in to WIN it. 

Their Happy Hour Menu is:
 $1.50 Oysters
 $3 Beef Filet Skewers
 $6 Spicy Shrimp Sushi Rolls
 $10 Truffled Tuna
 $5 Glasses of Rose
 $5 Moscow Mules
Half Price Sake

I got the Moscow mule and my friend got the Rose and we both loved our drinks. The complimentary edamame is also a nice touch once you sit down. The bay street cali roll was as amazing as ever. The homemade crab cake literally melts in your mouth and I got an extra side of the spicy mayo because, obviously. I also tried something new. They have black rice! I was hesitant at first but it&apos;s healthier and was recommended, so why not? I liked it and has a bit sweeter taste.

I also ordered the chicken ramen. This bowl is HUGE. I took half it home because it was so big. I enjoyed the red pepper flake garlic oil and I&apos;ll know next time if I order this it is fully sufficient for an entire meal.

Our server was Xavier and we found out he was very new to the job. He was friendly and very attentive. ALL of the staff were friendly and attentive. I don&apos;t think my water glass ever went below the halfway mark. Everyone was wearing a big smile and I love seeing that. Makes the whole experience that much more memorable :) 

Anyhoo, I had to write about this spot again because it&apos;s so good and you need to check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"This should&apos;ve been a 5 star review :( 
But unfortunately the service was sub par. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat. I loved that they played old R&amp;B hits. It&apos;s not your typical sushi spot. 

The food was great! Full of flavor and they offer &quot;black&quot; rice which I&apos;ve never heard of before! But apparently it&apos;s the healthiest rice known to man and really good! 

However, we waited over an hour for our food to be served and 30 minutes for every round of drinks we ordered. We started off buying sake by the bottle ..our waitress informed us that there were only two bottles of the Sake we were drinking. We told her we&apos;d take both but  wanted the second bottle to be served after the first bottle. When it was time for the second bottle our waitress disappeared or 45 minutes only to return and inform us that she couldn&apos;t find it. *eye roll* So we ended up switching to tequila but again had to wait 30 minutes just to receive our drinks. 

Overall, great food. Shit service. Enter at your own risk :)"
5,"Dropped in for happy hour and what a treat!  The Whiskey Boy is a great cocktail. Add some of the small bites and you&apos;ll be happy. The miso salmon is amazing and the Buffalo duck wing is AWESOME!  The staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Stop by!"
4,"A large group of us came here for dinner before a night out. It was really good and they offered a lot of specials! We just so happened to come during happy hour which had great food and drink deals.

We initially thought this place was similar to korean bbq but found that they just had a list of meat you can get grilled by the chef&apos;s at the bbq bar. A lot of us took advantage of the happy hour deals that included sushi, meat sticks, and moscow mules. The sushi was delicious!

I really liked the decor and vibe of the restaurant!"
5,Union Sushi + BBQ Bar never fails. I love their calamari so that&apos;s always a must for me. I tried the black rice sushi yesterday. Initially I was nervous but it&apos;s very good. It taste the same to me AND it&apos;s healthier. Why not? I definitely recommend the sampler. My favorite was the Hokkaido. The Devon is a sweet potato roll. Do not be intimidated. It&apos;s amazing!
2,"Ordered Shrimp Tempura, Bristol Bay, and Bay Street California rolls and seaweed salad for delivery. 

Delivery packaging - not very temper proof. The sticker on the paper bag wasn&apos;t placed properly, I wouldn&apos;t even know if the food was tempered with.

Food - the rolls are super small, and average tasting at best. Rice didn&apos;t taste fresh, the ingredients inside all 3 rolls were bland. The only one I thought was okay was the Bay Street California, which had crab cake inside. Overall over-priced, and not worth it. 

Seaweed salad - you really can&apos;t mess this one up, but the one I got severely lacked seasoning/rice vinegar, and was dry. Luckily I had some at home, and I had to put in quite a bit.

I&apos;ve dined once before and wasn&apos;t impressed either, but thought I&apos;d give it another try during quarantine. Conclusion, it&apos;s still a no-go for me."
5,"Lively atmosphere with basic sushi rolls and not so basic rolls. They gave us complimentary appetizers and also a special treat at the end of the meal (dessert) as it was our anniversary. 

I really love this place. It&apos;s not overly pretentious but also not a place you&apos;d go wearing gym clothes. Ambiance really is spot on.

The only disappointment was that I made an open table reservation and they didn&apos;t validate my reservation so I could get my points? Weird.

Our server was on point. I&apos;d come here again if I were in town."
3,"My friend and I came here for a late dinner, and despite it being a weekday and late, the place was decently crowded. We had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we hurriedly ordered. Our server was attentive and nice throughout our meal.

Old city market roll (4/5): This roll didn&apos;t have rice in it?! Maybe I should be glad that a bigger proportion of the roll was fish, but I still missed the familiarity of rice in a roll ready to absorb soy sauce and tying everything together.

Saba nigiri (5/5): mackerel is my favorite fish in nigiri, so I usually order it when I&apos;m at a sushi restaurant, and it didn&apos;t disappoint!

Duck yaki soba (3/5): This was soup-less noodles and was described as having tonkatsu sauce in it, but I found it quite dry. It had decent flavor and a nice spicy kick to it, but there were pieces of pepper in it where the skin of the pepper felt really tough and almost inedible. I left the dish almost untouched."
4,My husbands favorite place. My favorites are the coconut gelato because it has crispy coco flakes and it goes well with the gelato. Uni soba with ikura is unbeatable. They have good quality sushi and different type of rice like black rice. Oysters is ok to have but picture looks better than taste. I love crispy calamari but they can make it better because it&apos;s small cuts ( looks like those low quality frozen calamari) and lost the texture of it and it&apos;s lack of flavor.
4,"TLDR
Happy Hour menu items = solid, Old City Market maki, seafood ramen, robata skewers and crab legs. 

GETTING THERE
With its flashy red neon sign, Union is difficult to miss heading down Franklin. There&apos;s plenty of meter parking along the sidewalk, but the Chicago brown line is just a couple blocks north. Might be a probably the better option on a busy night. 

FARE
They have got unique and adventurous ramen selection. While our table set it a goal for each person to order different bowl of ramen, the server decided to step in and steer us to the right direction of choosing spicy pigtail or seafood ramen instead of the beef cheek as they are the most popular bowls in house. Thanks for looking out for us! Just a heads up, the uni alfredo soba is much smaller than the rest of the ramen bowls. The uni and suck sobas are dry while the other ramen counterparts are soup based. 

Union surely has you covered with the full Japanese cuisine experience. Ranging from colorful ramen, sushi, salads, appetizers, robata grill, there&apos;s surely something for everyone! I surely anticipate my next visit to try the rest of their menu."
