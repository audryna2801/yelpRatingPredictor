5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery.

The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"

4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!

It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."

4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."

These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."

5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"

I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world.

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke.

May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home.

Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."

For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER.

However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster.

5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.

Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well.

I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world.

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke.

May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home.

Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."

For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER.

However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster.

5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.

Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well.

I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world.

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke.

May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home.

Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."

For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER.

However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster.

5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.

Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well.

I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world.

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke.

May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home.

Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER. 

The wings are massive in size and the flavors outstanding. My favorite is definitely the Seoul Sassy sauce. It&apos;s a perfect balance between sweet and salty and kind of tastes like a light bulgogi/galbi marinade. But it&apos;s delicious. For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."

For those that are looking for something with bolder flavor, the bbq is also tasty. The wings are crispy but not overwhelmed with batter and have a ton of meat. Be sure to get the radish kimchi as it&apos;s the perfect side dish. 

The venue itself is small so get ready for a lot of &quot;excuses me&quot;s if you ever need to go between the counter and your table. Otherwise, the orders are called out by name and delivered directly to where you&apos;re sitting.

It&apos;s a little out of the way from the heart of downtown Chicago, but it&apos;s definitely worth the trip."
4,"Crisp has the best fried chicken wings and their kimchi is amazing. The Seoul Sassy flavor is my favorite! While the wings are amazing, we were kind of disappointed with the Seoul Sensation burrito! It had no flavor and was overall lackluster. I&apos;ve had a similar Korean-Mexican fusion burrito before at another place so it&apos;s hard not to compare it to that one! However, I will always come back to Crisp for their delicious wings."
4,"I used to love Crisp. I came all the time and ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce, and my husband&apos;s favorites are the Seoul sassy and BBQ wings. However, the last time my husband and I came, Crisp informed us that they now cook everything in their whole establishment in a fish-based sauce (I am allergic to fish and always double check with staff for potential contamination when ordering food anywhere). Whoops! Oh well, no more Crisp for me. 
Pictured are the wings my husband usually gets. Crisp has now become his go-to place when I&apos;m out of town, since I can&apos;t eat here anymore. 
Additional tip: it&apos;s best to get take out here and eat your food elsewhere if you live in the area. It is super crowded and there is limited seating, so you will like have trouble finding a table."
5,Awesome wings! Eat it while it&apos;s hot because it&apos;s not the same the next day. I love that the wings come in whole instead of a section.
4,"I&apos;m normally not a big fan of fried chicken but this was indeed very excellent chicken, as evidenced by everyone&apos;s reviews. I got a combo of the crisp bbq and seoul sassy drumsticks. These drumsticks were ginormous, very meaty, and tender. I liked both flavors with slight preference for the crisp bbq just because I don&apos;t like too much sauce on fried chicken."
5,"Yes. Yes to everything. 

Seoul Sassy tenders and the the BBQ Foodie&apos;s Choice Crisp Sandwich all day. 

Their onion rings stay crispy no matter the environment - even cold from the fridge the next day. 

Deliciousness down the block."
5,"When I say these are the best Korean chicken wings. These are the best Korean chicken wings. I&apos;ve had my fair share and I will never go back to those places after going to Crisp. The wings are huge and so juicy, tender, sweet, savory and just overall delicious. You gotta pair it with a nice light beer. If you haven&apos;t been here yet... What in the world are you waiting for??"
5,"Some of the best wings in the city! Such great food and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend trying the wings and their bowls as well. 
Staff was very accommodating when we arrived, great service for takeout as well. Highly recommend to anyone in the east lake view area to give it a try, you will not be disappointed"
5,"1000% our favorite place to get fried chicken in Chicago!! The jumbo wings are a must-try! You can now order for pick-up or delivery. Even before the pandemic, we would typically order carry out since the seating is fairly packed and limited. Bear in mind that your transportation time will impact any food from any restaurant, but I think Crisp Korean fried chicken wings are delicious immediately, after a 20 min drive, or even as leftovers the next day!

Our go-to order is 10 jumbo wings split between the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ sauces. I love the green onions that are sprinkled on the Seoul Sassy wings - they add the perfect balance of flavor. The Crisp BBQ can be a bit spicy for me, which is why we order two flavors, but the gojuchang flavor is worth the burn!"
5,"Crisp may arguably be the BEST Korean fried chicken in all of Chicago! A Lakeview staple, Crisp is always busy, and makes for amazing take out/delivery. It&apos;s no surprise this place already has well over 3k reviews, with a majority of them being 5 stars. And they have more than just fried chicken, their bowls and homemade kimchi are also out of this world. 

My go to order is a 10 piece wings, half seoul sassy half spicy crispy bbq. And a side of suicide sauce (be warned, it&apos;s HOT). I also love their buddha bowl, a take on the classic Korean bi bim bop. The &quot;baby&quot; size is large! And filled with your choice of veggies and topped with gochujang. It&apos;s delicious. And then always a side of their kimchi and order of fries, which are fried perfectly to perfection and help with the heat from your wings. There really isn&apos;t anything on their menu I haven&apos;t tried I didn&apos;t love. If you live in the area, be sure to order through their website or give them a call as to avoid the charge delivery couriers charge, and support the business directly! If you&apos;re looking for a sign to give Crisp a try, this is it."
5,"We came in to order some of their favorite wings. The phone ordering process was easy, and their customer service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and even thanked us for stopping in. 

We ordered their Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of bbq and wings, but for some reason Korean style wings with bbq is a must. The Seoul Sassy was sweet and made with ginger, soy, garlic. It was ok but the Crisp BBQ is where it&apos;s at. They were spicy, with a hint of sweetness and smoke. The wings were huge and very filling. The wings were perfectly fried and seasoned perfectly. The wings has the perfect Crisp with every bite. 

Crisp serves some of not these best Korean wings in the city. I will definitely be returning for some more wings."
3,"Crisp is good, but not great. There&apos;s a lot of hype for the Korean fried chicken and I just don&apos;t get it. The food isn&apos;t bad at all, but I wouldn&apos;t go outta my way to pick up an order. The jumbo wings are described as hormone free. If you don&apos;t care for large wings you might want to opt for the legs or tenders.

The staff could also use refresher training. Popularity shouldn&apos;t impact great customer service :-\"
4,"We got takeout order of the jumbo chicken wings (50/50 sassy seoul and plain jane) and the Seoul Steak Bowl with extra meat.

Jumbo Chicken Wings
Solid Sassy seoul wings , not super saucy and still had some crisp after making it home. 
Plain Jane is so plain I&apos;m not even sure they added salt, but they were crispier than the sassy seoul. I just wanted to see what their korean fried chicken tasted like by itself. 

DO NOT GET THE SEOUL STEAK BOWL. The white rice was either barely parboiled or just severely undercooked because I felt like I was chewing gum. The bulgogi meat was very thick and dry. May as well go to convenience store and buy some rice-roni and teriyaki beef jerky because it&apos;d be cheaper and taste about the same.

Tl;dr: 
Jumbo wings were good, but not very sassy
Don&apos;t order anything else"
4,"Been dying to check out this place since it&apos;s well loved on Yelp! First of all, gotta way all the reviews hold true haha. The chicken wings are ginormous. We ordered 20 wings for 3 people, and we couldn&apos;t finish and were absolutely stuffed. 

We got the Seoul Sassy wings and the Crispy BBQ (extra spicy). The Seoul Sassy were great! Absolutely loved the sauce. The bbq was also good but really spicy haha, so don&apos;t order unless you can handle your spice! The chicken overall was well cooked and crispy. 

In terms of service - they seems pretty busy on a Tuesday night! Just keep that in mind as you&apos;re ordering. Glad to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!"
4,"I love Crisp.  I&apos;m a big fan of their boneless chicken strips in various sauces (beware, some are quite hot), and their bowls.  And actually their fries are quite good too.  Quality is there.  Definitely friendly and quick staff.  Price is okay for what you get - worth the money though not the best deal in town or anything.

This is a solid, delicious Korean chicken experience.  Try it!"
5,Has to be my favorite korean fried chicken wing joint in the city by far. Get the Seoul Sassy flavor with a side of their special house sauce blend sauce. Add some fries to complete the experience. Such a good combo and very filling!
5,"If you&apos;re in the mood for Bibimbap, look no further than Crisp. You&apos;d be remiss not to try their Korean style wings, and the Big Buddha Bowl is a must."
4,"We wanted to get some KFC so we stopped by here to get dinner. However, walking inside, it was really crowded with no seats left. We decided to order to-go instead. You can order at counter and they will call out your order when it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s more of a self-served place.

We ended up finding seats by the window and decided to stay. The place was pretty snug but very casual. I ordered the Bad boy buddha bowl with steaks added. This bowl came with 8 different types of veggies, rice at the bottom, and egg on top. 

I added some spicy mayo that was on the table into the rice bowl for an extra spicy flavor. The portion with the 8 veggies could probably feed two people. Overall, a cool Korean spot in the area."
4,"Good crispy chicken but you have to know the sauce you want, if not you are gonna waste the whole
order. over all, love it and will be back"
5,"A must have in Lakeview, and Chicago overall. We love getting the sassy Seoul wings with the fire sauce on the side. Kimchi is also amazing."
5,"Nothings really changed about this place since I first visited back in 2013. This is the place I always reminisce about because they were some of the best Korean wings I&apos;ve had. EVER.
