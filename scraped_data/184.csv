5,"We ordered delivery from here tonight on Grubhub and were blown away by the quality! We tried the crepes, empanadas, shakes, coffee &amp; even horchata!

Every single item was purely delicious and had a unique flavor that impressed my whole family! The banana &amp; Nutella crepes were light, fluffy &amp; packed with Nutella goodness. The lime crepe literally blew my mind. It&apos;s basically key lime pie in a crepe. It was delicate, light, and had the perfect tart lime flavor.

Spinach &amp; ricotta empanadas were flaky and they came with the most amazing pepper relish dipping sauce that made them even tastier. We are so excited to try different flavors the next time!

The Oreo milkshake was to die for. I don&apos;t even know how they get it to taste so good. It had such a deep &amp; rich flavor. But it wasn&apos;t overly thick like other milkshakes. It had the perfect consistency and Oreo blended throughout.

My sister tried their &quot;hot horchata&quot; which was basically like hot chocolate except horchata flavored! Omg! How unique and so tasty. She said it was her favorite thing.

So happy we tried this place! You can really tell each and every item is prepared with care and consideration. It&apos;s hard to find home cooking this good nowadays. So glad we have this neighborhood gem!!"
5,"I can honestly say that I can count my stellar food experiences in the past 6 months on one hand. But 6050 tonight was 5 stars across the board. Boom boom boom! 

Social distancing protocol: 5 stars. Order online for no contact pickup at the window, or order through an intercom behind a window. 

Customer service: 5 stars!! One of the owners (I&apos;m assuming) was taking orders behind the window and was so sweet. I mentioned that we had recently moved into the neighborhood and they took the time to give me a Portage Park pamphlet and wrote sweet notes on the box. They also threw in an extra dipping sauce. Warm fuzzies. Warm fuzzies all around! 

Empanadas: 5 stars. Lots of unique flavors to choose from. We got the porky, chaat, and chorizo. Ugh. Warm. Flakey. Crisp, but also soft and chewy. The crust is perfectly thin to let the fillings shine through. The fillings themselves are well seasoned and balanced. Dipping sauce was a sweet and spicy sauce that was a great compliment to the empanadas! 

Ice cream: I&apos;ll admit it. I&apos;ve been a Jeni&apos;s fan girl, but this ice cream is something worth writing home about. We got the pistachio and chocolate ice cream. I love a pistachio that doesn&apos;t pretend to be almond or cherry - it&apos;s just pure roasted nuttiness. And the chocolate. Heavenly, rich, creamy chocolate! So good. 

Our hearts and bellies are happy. We will be back!"
5,"I normally don&apos;t take the time to leave reviews, but felt the need to with this one. 
I ordered delivery and never really have high hopes when it comes to having food delivered from most places since the quality can change a bit when placed in a container and the added time to get to you. 
However, from the minute I received my order (my first time ever) from them I couldn&apos;t help but have a big smile. They wrote the sweetest message on the box as well as the symbols for each empanada. So cute!
Now to the food. I ordered the ham &amp; cheese, sweet corn chat masala, pulled porky and a passion fruit tea. SO GOOD. The empanada crust was perfect, the fillings were flavorful and the tea was refreshing. Definitely add them to your list of places to try!"
5,"Discovered this place by accident and couldn&apos;t be more glad that I did. Their ice creams are to die for. Every flavor I have had, has been nothing short of exception in taste and quality of ingredients. I would save I buy 4 pints ever 2-3 months and I wouldn&apos;t be upset if that average increases especially come summer time. 

Amazing people, amazing quality, amazing place!"
5,"Bistro 6050 is such a cute little spot for a quick sweet or salty treat! 

The menu is SO extensive ranging from empanadas to burgers to crepes and ice cream. I really like that there are a few vegetarian empanadas available. I didn&apos;t try any this time but I&apos;m looking forward to trying a couple next visit! 

To crave my sweet tooth, I ordered the banana Nutella crepes. The French velvet crepes were spot on! I especially liked how the crepes were not paper thin. They held their shape/structure which made them enjoyable to eat. The decadent Nutella filling added quite a punch. Banana flavor was not overpowering. I recommend these for people with a chocolate craving. 

I really enjoy how each item has a handwritten message. &quot;Hello beautiful&quot; was written on my crepe box  and &quot;stay cute&quot; on the side of my friends milkshake. It is such a unique gesture that I haven&apos;t seen anywhere else. Major brownie points."
5,"This is probably my favourite restaurant right now and I don&apos;t pick favourites often. Every time I order from here, I get at least six of the peruvian chicken emps. I&apos;m honestly obsessed with them. This place is speedy, always accurate, and they often leave little notes written on my containers. It&apos;s like the old days when your mum had wished you a great day on a sticky note stashed in your lunch box for school...

Sorry, that was weird. In short, I LOVE THIS PLACE. My only complaint is  that it isn&apos;t closer!

With love,
   Sonii"
5,"Hands down, this is literally one of the best local spots on the northwest side of the city. Their ice cream is to die for! Interesting flavors that you would never find at a Baskin Robins. Taro is personally one of my favorites, their Biscoff and Forrero Rocher are also delicious! 

The owners are absolute sweet hearts! I&apos;ve heard the empanadas are amazing as well. I haven&apos;t personally tried them yet but plan too. If you haven&apos;t visited Bistro yet, make it a point to!"
5,Back at it again. Third time this week and every time has been delightful. This place has the best ice cream and the best drinks.
5,Absolutely love the sweets at Bistro 6050.  Ice Cream is great and the Crepes are dee-licious.   Service is top-notch and the overall vibe is warm and cozy so looking forward to dining in when that&apos;s available again.
5,"A friend of mine who lives in the area recommended this place so I stopped by on a hot day and wanted a fruity tea drink.  Because, it&apos;s my first time I wanted to order several things so Chris recommended several items. During our short conversation he offered me free samples and truly awesome recommendations. The Nutella milkshake was a delight and the guava tea was very refreshing . Then ice cream samples were amazing and the nuts was very different and a very healthy snack.  I really liked that Chris took his time to explain everything to me and recommend specific time.  I haven&apos;t tried everything but I will definitely be back to try everything on the menu!"
5,"STILL the Best place in Chicago for so many things!  Come for the Empanadas!  Stay for the Homemade Ice Cream!  Truly, the best ice cream I&apos;ve ever had comes from the Bistro!  Try the new chocolate+coffee+marshmallow+Nutella+chocochips=CHOCOMARNUTCHIP , it&apos;s my new favorite, so rich and delish.

Crepes are amazing too, teas and coffee, Shakes and More!  Don&apos;t miss out!"
5,"Seems like there&apos;s enough 5 stars so I&apos;ll keep this as a list for my own future orders.

Barbacoa - hearty and tastes a little like sloppy joe with a kick
Ham and Cheese - tastes like ham and cheese
Cheesy Pepperjelly - tastes like the sauce! Very interesting
Spinach Ricotta - probably one of the more bland ones
TSAP - tastes like Indian Samosa. Just potato blend but nice flavor
Spanish Chorizo - more subtle than expected but I really liked it
Pinoyski Chicken - Tasty! 
Pulled Pork - &quot;distinct taste&quot; says husband"
5,"Our first trying it and we loved it. The owner helped was super nice and sweet and welcomed us to the neighborhood. We tried the ube shake, passion fruit bubble tea, crapes and tree different empanadas. Can&apos;t wait to go back and order some more, they have so many choices :)"
5,"We been coming to Bistro 6050 for years and always everything is amazing !!! If you like to support small local businesses definitely this is the place to come,  either if you have the craving for coffee, a burger or and ice cream."
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try Bistro 6050 for a while and ended up getting takeout twice this week. I love how they have the front door set up for pick up. 

We tried ice cream first and the coconut and raspberry with chips were both delicious! Later in the week we picked up empanadas, and each was great! Will be back!"
4,"Based on a side conversation with Phil S, I decided to stop by and check out Bistro 6050.  The location is easy enough to get to on Irving Park and in a good location as it is not too close to the stop light at Austin, which gets very crowded and makes crossing the street or getting out of your car a somewhat dangerous ordeal.  If you have ever parked there, you will know what I mean.  I was able to cross the street and live to tell the tale.

The place itself is very cute once you get inside.  There are plenty of tables if you chose to dine in, but quite frankly this is food I would want to take home and enjoy in the comfort of my home with some bubbles.  I loved that there were two nice size stuffed chairs where I could sit and wait for my order.

Because I was hungry and Phil&apos;s review said that he wished the empanadas were bigger, I order three of each of the following:  barbacoa, creamy chicken, spinach ricotta, TSAP (traditional south asian potato), ham/cheese and the pulled porky. In addition I ordered the barbacoa, creamy chicken and asian chicken adobo.  Full disclosure, since I was doing take out, I figured that I would do the full monty and get t all.  No way me and The Doctor were going to eat all of this, but figured I would have lunch and dinner for the next few days.

The young lady who assisted me seemed surprise at the amount I was ordering and wanted to know if I was having a party...HAHAHAHA!  Very cute.  She was very helpful in taking my order and provided me with a free sweet tea made from Earl Grey.  I have never done EG cold, but gotta say I loved it.  The other nice thing was that they were playing this incredible jazz music; that coupled with the comfy chair and iced tea made the time go by fast. I had parked on the meter and had added 30 mins from my phone app, which was perfect.  She actually checked to see if I was on a meter to make sure I didn&apos;t run out of time while they prepared my food.

I love that the empanadas are baked, not fried and that they had these little identifiers on them (flower, triangle,star, square, etc.) to help tell which was which.  The top of the containers had hand written descriptions and drawing of the little identifiers to allow you to decipher what was in each container.  They also came with a pepper jelly dipping sauce.  Three empanadas are $8.95; while they seemed small, I got full on what I had.  The pastry was nice and light and baking added a cleaner flavor than what you would get from being fried in oil.

The crepes were also very nice, light with a slightly sweet taste to them.  The pepper jelly was not what I expected...it was sweet.  The Doctor liked it but I didn&apos;t use any as it was too sweet for me (just my personal taste, nothing against the jelly).  I had to travel another 28 mins to get home due to traffic, but I am happy to report that the food was still warm.  The Doctor and I tried everything but the spinach/TSAP and the Creamy Chicken crepes. Saving those for tomorrow.

I would say the barbacoa was nice, tender and a different flavor since it wasn&apos;t prepared like I am used to from Mexican restaurants, but delicious none the less.  Pulled Porky and Creamy Chicken were good as well, very nice blending of subtle flavors without overpowering the meat and pastry.

The crepes were great and well prepared (speaking as someone who makes crepes).  I did not require a knife to eat the crepes, which goes towards how tender the crepe and meat were.  I think next time I will try one of the dessert crepes.  I don&apos;t usually do dessert but they have a chocolate and coconut one, two of my favorite flavors (I still dream about that chocolate coconut cake from the now closed Booth One).

Gotta say this was a pleasant surprise for me and it was on the way home.  I don&apos;t go this way home all the time, but this place could get me to alter my route every now and then."
5,"Best ice cream! So creamy! I especially love the flavors Ferraro Rocher, Biscoff (like a caramel flavored cookie), raspberry good (raspberry ice cream with chocolate chips)"
5,"The best attention, the best ice creams ever!!! Amazing! You have to pass by if you&apos;re in Chicago!
Attended by its Belgian owner, such a great business man! Thank you for all suggestions and kind words late at night!! 
(One of the Venezuelan ladies of Saturday night, and Sunday!)"
5,"The beauty of mom and pop restaurants are not only the outstanding customer service that it provides, but also, the fresh ingredients that the restaurant are almost and usually guarantees to deliver. 

As I discovered the restaurant by yelp searching on a late night for some bad craving for sweets, Bostro 6050 was the first pop out. The outside of the shop may not look like much, but if you do drive slowly you would definitely spot it easily . I could go on to talk about the interior of the restaurant but I am sure that not what we are here for . So let&apos;s just dive right in : 

Service: absolutely outstanding since both owner(the wife and the husband) make sure you are being take good care of. 

Parking : street parking are easier to be found

Food: 

Gelato is a must in the menu specially the pistachio flavor, you might noticed the color is not as &quot;vibrant&quot; as the super market brand(but that&apos;s because they use the real deal instead of food coloring ). Also, their per-scoop size aren&apos;t the same as store brands, but trust me, you are tasting the concentrated version of gelato(literally). Which I also recommend the Rose flavor just cause no where else had it (that&apos;s if you want to be more advantageous). Their empanadas are also very outstanding! I am not much of a pork person but the Barbacoa are delicious. 

If you are looking for something different, fresh and local, give them a try! As both of the restaurant owners will tell you everything about their proudly productions . 

P.S: and no, they did not pay me for speaking so highly of them, I am just genuinely promoting business owners that are truly passion with their business."
5,"My wife&apos;s former co worker told me about Bistro 6050 awhile ago so I bookmarked it.  Well tonight I decided to stop by and check it out 5 Stars on 203 reviews impressive.  What&apos;s the scoop?  8:15pm and the place is packed.  They seem to be a little short staffed cause the poor girl in the front seems to be totally overwhelmed, scrambling &amp; frazzled to keep up w/the demand for drinks, ice cream, crepes &amp; coffees.  The empanadas are prepared &amp; cooked in the back.  Each order placed is served piping hot &amp; fresh.  

Bistro 6059 is kind of a cool place sort of a 50&apos;s Style diner w/old time music playing.  

* Creamy Chicken - Peruvian Style cooking W/dairies, imported yellow hot peppers &amp; spicy.  Absolutely remarkable (my Favorite one)
* Barbacoa - slow cooked beef for 6hrs mixed w/herbs &amp; spices w/a little kick.  Very good soft seasoned beef that melts in your mouth
* Spinach Ricotta - spinach, ricotta, mozzarella &amp; Parmesan cheeses (least favorite)

The empanadas were excellent and probably the best commercially made empanadas I ever had.  I will definitely be back again very soon.  The only thing is I wish they were a little bigger."

My sister tried their &quot;hot horchata&quot; which was basically like hot chocolate except horchata flavored! Omg! How unique and so tasty. She said it was her favorite thing.

So happy we tried this place! You can really tell each and every item is prepared with care and consideration. It&apos;s hard to find home cooking this good nowadays. So glad we have this neighborhood gem!!"
5,"I can honestly say that I can count my stellar food experiences in the past 6 months on one hand. But 6050 tonight was 5 stars across the board. Boom boom boom! 

Social distancing protocol: 5 stars. Order online for no contact pickup at the window, or order through an intercom behind a window. 

Customer service: 5 stars!! One of the owners (I&apos;m assuming) was taking orders behind the window and was so sweet. I mentioned that we had recently moved into the neighborhood and they took the time to give me a Portage Park pamphlet and wrote sweet notes on the box. They also threw in an extra dipping sauce. Warm fuzzies. Warm fuzzies all around! 

Empanadas: 5 stars. Lots of unique flavors to choose from. We got the porky, chaat, and chorizo. Ugh. Warm. Flakey. Crisp, but also soft and chewy. The crust is perfectly thin to let the fillings shine through. The fillings themselves are well seasoned and balanced. Dipping sauce was a sweet and spicy sauce that was a great compliment to the empanadas! 

Ice cream: I&apos;ll admit it. I&apos;ve been a Jeni&apos;s fan girl, but this ice cream is something worth writing home about. We got the pistachio and chocolate ice cream. I love a pistachio that doesn&apos;t pretend to be almond or cherry - it&apos;s just pure roasted nuttiness. And the chocolate. Heavenly, rich, creamy chocolate! So good. 

Our hearts and bellies are happy. We will be back!"
5,"I normally don&apos;t take the time to leave reviews, but felt the need to with this one. 
I ordered delivery and never really have high hopes when it comes to having food delivered from most places since the quality can change a bit when placed in a container and the added time to get to you. 
However, from the minute I received my order (my first time ever) from them I couldn&apos;t help but have a big smile. They wrote the sweetest message on the box as well as the symbols for each empanada. So cute!
Now to the food. I ordered the ham &amp; cheese, sweet corn chat masala, pulled porky and a passion fruit tea. SO GOOD. The empanada crust was perfect, the fillings were flavorful and the tea was refreshing. Definitely add them to your list of places to try!"
5,"Discovered this place by accident and couldn&apos;t be more glad that I did. Their ice creams are to die for. Every flavor I have had, has been nothing short of exception in taste and quality of ingredients. I would save I buy 4 pints ever 2-3 months and I wouldn&apos;t be upset if that average increases especially come summer time. 

Amazing people, amazing quality, amazing place!"
5,"Bistro 6050 is such a cute little spot for a quick sweet or salty treat! 

The menu is SO extensive ranging from empanadas to burgers to crepes and ice cream. I really like that there are a few vegetarian empanadas available. I didn&apos;t try any this time but I&apos;m looking forward to trying a couple next visit! 

To crave my sweet tooth, I ordered the banana Nutella crepes. The French velvet crepes were spot on! I especially liked how the crepes were not paper thin. They held their shape/structure which made them enjoyable to eat. The decadent Nutella filling added quite a punch. Banana flavor was not overpowering. I recommend these for people with a chocolate craving. 

I really enjoy how each item has a handwritten message. &quot;Hello beautiful&quot; was written on my crepe box  and &quot;stay cute&quot; on the side of my friends milkshake. It is such a unique gesture that I haven&apos;t seen anywhere else. Major brownie points."
5,"This is probably my favourite restaurant right now and I don&apos;t pick favourites often. Every time I order from here, I get at least six of the peruvian chicken emps. I&apos;m honestly obsessed with them. This place is speedy, always accurate, and they often leave little notes written on my containers. It&apos;s like the old days when your mum had wished you a great day on a sticky note stashed in your lunch box for school...

Sorry, that was weird. In short, I LOVE THIS PLACE. My only complaint is  that it isn&apos;t closer!

With love,
   Sonii"
5,"Hands down, this is literally one of the best local spots on the northwest side of the city. Their ice cream is to die for! Interesting flavors that you would never find at a Baskin Robins. Taro is personally one of my favorites, their Biscoff and Forrero Rocher are also delicious! 

The owners are absolute sweet hearts! I&apos;ve heard the empanadas are amazing as well. I haven&apos;t personally tried them yet but plan too. If you haven&apos;t visited Bistro yet, make it a point to!"
5,Back at it again. Third time this week and every time has been delightful. This place has the best ice cream and the best drinks.
5,Absolutely love the sweets at Bistro 6050.  Ice Cream is great and the Crepes are dee-licious.   Service is top-notch and the overall vibe is warm and cozy so looking forward to dining in when that&apos;s available again.
5,"A friend of mine who lives in the area recommended this place so I stopped by on a hot day and wanted a fruity tea drink.  Because, it&apos;s my first time I wanted to order several things so Chris recommended several items. During our short conversation he offered me free samples and truly awesome recommendations. The Nutella milkshake was a delight and the guava tea was very refreshing . Then ice cream samples were amazing and the nuts was very different and a very healthy snack.  I really liked that Chris took his time to explain everything to me and recommend specific time.  I haven&apos;t tried everything but I will definitely be back to try everything on the menu!"
5,"STILL the Best place in Chicago for so many things!  Come for the Empanadas!  Stay for the Homemade Ice Cream!  Truly, the best ice cream I&apos;ve ever had comes from the Bistro!  Try the new chocolate+coffee+marshmallow+Nutella+chocochips=CHOCOMARNUTCHIP , it&apos;s my new favorite, so rich and delish.

Crepes are amazing too, teas and coffee, Shakes and More!  Don&apos;t miss out!"
5,"Seems like there&apos;s enough 5 stars so I&apos;ll keep this as a list for my own future orders.

Barbacoa - hearty and tastes a little like sloppy joe with a kick
Ham and Cheese - tastes like ham and cheese
Cheesy Pepperjelly - tastes like the sauce! Very interesting
Spinach Ricotta - probably one of the more bland ones
TSAP - tastes like Indian Samosa. Just potato blend but nice flavor
Spanish Chorizo - more subtle than expected but I really liked it
Pinoyski Chicken - Tasty! 
Pulled Pork - &quot;distinct taste&quot; says husband"
5,"Our first trying it and we loved it. The owner helped was super nice and sweet and welcomed us to the neighborhood. We tried the ube shake, passion fruit bubble tea, crapes and tree different empanadas. Can&apos;t wait to go back and order some more, they have so many choices :)"
5,"We been coming to Bistro 6050 for years and always everything is amazing !!! If you like to support small local businesses definitely this is the place to come,  either if you have the craving for coffee, a burger or and ice cream."
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try Bistro 6050 for a while and ended up getting takeout twice this week. I love how they have the front door set up for pick up. 

We tried ice cream first and the coconut and raspberry with chips were both delicious! Later in the week we picked up empanadas, and each was great! Will be back!"
4,"Based on a side conversation with Phil S, I decided to stop by and check out Bistro 6050.  The location is easy enough to get to on Irving Park and in a good location as it is not too close to the stop light at Austin, which gets very crowded and makes crossing the street or getting out of your car a somewhat dangerous ordeal.  If you have ever parked there, you will know what I mean.  I was able to cross the street and live to tell the tale.

The place itself is very cute once you get inside.  There are plenty of tables if you chose to dine in, but quite frankly this is food I would want to take home and enjoy in the comfort of my home with some bubbles.  I loved that there were two nice size stuffed chairs where I could sit and wait for my order.

Because I was hungry and Phil&apos;s review said that he wished the empanadas were bigger, I order three of each of the following:  barbacoa, creamy chicken, spinach ricotta, TSAP (traditional south asian potato), ham/cheese and the pulled porky. In addition I ordered the barbacoa, creamy chicken and asian chicken adobo.  Full disclosure, since I was doing take out, I figured that I would do the full monty and get t all.  No way me and The Doctor were going to eat all of this, but figured I would have lunch and dinner for the next few days.

The young lady who assisted me seemed surprise at the amount I was ordering and wanted to know if I was having a party...HAHAHAHA!  Very cute.  She was very helpful in taking my order and provided me with a free sweet tea made from Earl Grey.  I have never done EG cold, but gotta say I loved it.  The other nice thing was that they were playing this incredible jazz music; that coupled with the comfy chair and iced tea made the time go by fast. I had parked on the meter and had added 30 mins from my phone app, which was perfect.  She actually checked to see if I was on a meter to make sure I didn&apos;t run out of time while they prepared my food.

I love that the empanadas are baked, not fried and that they had these little identifiers on them (flower, triangle,star, square, etc.) to help tell which was which.  The top of the containers had hand written descriptions and drawing of the little identifiers to allow you to decipher what was in each container.  They also came with a pepper jelly dipping sauce.  Three empanadas are $8.95; while they seemed small, I got full on what I had.  The pastry was nice and light and baking added a cleaner flavor than what you would get from being fried in oil.

The crepes were also very nice, light with a slightly sweet taste to them.  The pepper jelly was not what I expected...it was sweet.  The Doctor liked it but I didn&apos;t use any as it was too sweet for me (just my personal taste, nothing against the jelly).  I had to travel another 28 mins to get home due to traffic, but I am happy to report that the food was still warm.  The Doctor and I tried everything but the spinach/TSAP and the Creamy Chicken crepes. Saving those for tomorrow.

I would say the barbacoa was nice, tender and a different flavor since it wasn&apos;t prepared like I am used to from Mexican restaurants, but delicious none the less.  Pulled Porky and Creamy Chicken were good as well, very nice blending of subtle flavors without overpowering the meat and pastry.

The crepes were great and well prepared (speaking as someone who makes crepes).  I did not require a knife to eat the crepes, which goes towards how tender the crepe and meat were.  I think next time I will try one of the dessert crepes.  I don&apos;t usually do dessert but they have a chocolate and coconut one, two of my favorite flavors (I still dream about that chocolate coconut cake from the now closed Booth One).

Gotta say this was a pleasant surprise for me and it was on the way home.  I don&apos;t go this way home all the time, but this place could get me to alter my route every now and then."
5,"Best ice cream! So creamy! I especially love the flavors Ferraro Rocher, Biscoff (like a caramel flavored cookie), raspberry good (raspberry ice cream with chocolate chips)"
5,"The best attention, the best ice creams ever!!! Amazing! You have to pass by if you&apos;re in Chicago!
Attended by its Belgian owner, such a great business man! Thank you for all suggestions and kind words late at night!! 
(One of the Venezuelan ladies of Saturday night, and Sunday!)"
5,"The beauty of mom and pop restaurants are not only the outstanding customer service that it provides, but also, the fresh ingredients that the restaurant are almost and usually guarantees to deliver. 

As I discovered the restaurant by yelp searching on a late night for some bad craving for sweets, Bostro 6050 was the first pop out. The outside of the shop may not look like much, but if you do drive slowly you would definitely spot it easily . I could go on to talk about the interior of the restaurant but I am sure that not what we are here for . So let&apos;s just dive right in : 

Service: absolutely outstanding since both owner(the wife and the husband) make sure you are being take good care of. 

Parking : street parking are easier to be found

Food: 

Gelato is a must in the menu specially the pistachio flavor, you might noticed the color is not as &quot;vibrant&quot; as the super market brand(but that&apos;s because they use the real deal instead of food coloring ). Also, their per-scoop size aren&apos;t the same as store brands, but trust me, you are tasting the concentrated version of gelato(literally). Which I also recommend the Rose flavor just cause no where else had it (that&apos;s if you want to be more advantageous). Their empanadas are also very outstanding! I am not much of a pork person but the Barbacoa are delicious. 

If you are looking for something different, fresh and local, give them a try! As both of the restaurant owners will tell you everything about their proudly productions . 

P.S: and no, they did not pay me for speaking so highly of them, I am just genuinely promoting business owners that are truly passion with their business."
5,"My wife&apos;s former co worker told me about Bistro 6050 awhile ago so I bookmarked it.  Well tonight I decided to stop by and check it out 5 Stars on 203 reviews impressive.  What&apos;s the scoop?  8:15pm and the place is packed.  They seem to be a little short staffed cause the poor girl in the front seems to be totally overwhelmed, scrambling &amp; frazzled to keep up w/the demand for drinks, ice cream, crepes &amp; coffees.  The empanadas are prepared &amp; cooked in the back.  Each order placed is served piping hot &amp; fresh.  

Bistro 6059 is kind of a cool place sort of a 50&apos;s Style diner w/old time music playing.  

* Creamy Chicken - Peruvian Style cooking W/dairies, imported yellow hot peppers &amp; spicy.  Absolutely remarkable (my Favorite one)
* Barbacoa - slow cooked beef for 6hrs mixed w/herbs &amp; spices w/a little kick.  Very good soft seasoned beef that melts in your mouth
* Spinach Ricotta - spinach, ricotta, mozzarella &amp; Parmesan cheeses (least favorite)

The empanadas were excellent and probably the best commercially made empanadas I ever had.  I will definitely be back again very soon.  The only thing is I wish they were a little bigger."
5,"We ordered delivery from here tonight on Grubhub and were blown away by the quality! We tried the crepes, empanadas, shakes, coffee &amp; even horchata!

Every single item was purely delicious and had a unique flavor that impressed my whole family! The banana &amp; Nutella crepes were light, fluffy &amp; packed with Nutella goodness. The lime crepe literally blew my mind. It&apos;s basically key lime pie in a crepe. It was delicate, light, and had the perfect tart lime flavor.

Spinach &amp; ricotta empanadas were flaky and they came with the most amazing pepper relish dipping sauce that made them even tastier. We are so excited to try different flavors the next time!

Social distancing protocol: 5 stars. Order online for no contact pickup at the window, or order through an intercom behind a window. 

Customer service: 5 stars!! One of the owners (I&apos;m assuming) was taking orders behind the window and was so sweet. I mentioned that we had recently moved into the neighborhood and they took the time to give me a Portage Park pamphlet and wrote sweet notes on the box. They also threw in an extra dipping sauce. Warm fuzzies. Warm fuzzies all around! 

Empanadas: 5 stars. Lots of unique flavors to choose from. We got the porky, chaat, and chorizo. Ugh. Warm. Flakey. Crisp, but also soft and chewy. The crust is perfectly thin to let the fillings shine through. The fillings themselves are well seasoned and balanced. Dipping sauce was a sweet and spicy sauce that was a great compliment to the empanadas! 

Ice cream: I&apos;ll admit it. I&apos;ve been a Jeni&apos;s fan girl, but this ice cream is something worth writing home about. We got the pistachio and chocolate ice cream. I love a pistachio that doesn&apos;t pretend to be almond or cherry - it&apos;s just pure roasted nuttiness. And the chocolate. Heavenly, rich, creamy chocolate! So good. 

Our hearts and bellies are happy. We will be back!"
5,"I normally don&apos;t take the time to leave reviews, but felt the need to with this one. 
I ordered delivery and never really have high hopes when it comes to having food delivered from most places since the quality can change a bit when placed in a container and the added time to get to you. 
However, from the minute I received my order (my first time ever) from them I couldn&apos;t help but have a big smile. They wrote the sweetest message on the box as well as the symbols for each empanada. So cute!
Now to the food. I ordered the ham &amp; cheese, sweet corn chat masala, pulled porky and a passion fruit tea. SO GOOD. The empanada crust was perfect, the fillings were flavorful and the tea was refreshing. Definitely add them to your list of places to try!"
5,"Discovered this place by accident and couldn&apos;t be more glad that I did. Their ice creams are to die for. Every flavor I have had, has been nothing short of exception in taste and quality of ingredients. I would save I buy 4 pints ever 2-3 months and I wouldn&apos;t be upset if that average increases especially come summer time. 

Amazing people, amazing quality, amazing place!"
5,"Bistro 6050 is such a cute little spot for a quick sweet or salty treat! 

The menu is SO extensive ranging from empanadas to burgers to crepes and ice cream. I really like that there are a few vegetarian empanadas available. I didn&apos;t try any this time but I&apos;m looking forward to trying a couple next visit! 

To crave my sweet tooth, I ordered the banana Nutella crepes. The French velvet crepes were spot on! I especially liked how the crepes were not paper thin. They held their shape/structure which made them enjoyable to eat. The decadent Nutella filling added quite a punch. Banana flavor was not overpowering. I recommend these for people with a chocolate craving. 

I really enjoy how each item has a handwritten message. &quot;Hello beautiful&quot; was written on my crepe box  and &quot;stay cute&quot; on the side of my friends milkshake. It is such a unique gesture that I haven&apos;t seen anywhere else. Major brownie points."
5,"This is probably my favourite restaurant right now and I don&apos;t pick favourites often. Every time I order from here, I get at least six of the peruvian chicken emps. I&apos;m honestly obsessed with them. This place is speedy, always accurate, and they often leave little notes written on my containers. It&apos;s like the old days when your mum had wished you a great day on a sticky note stashed in your lunch box for school...

Sorry, that was weird. In short, I LOVE THIS PLACE. My only complaint is  that it isn&apos;t closer!

With love,
   Sonii"
5,"Hands down, this is literally one of the best local spots on the northwest side of the city. Their ice cream is to die for! Interesting flavors that you would never find at a Baskin Robins. Taro is personally one of my favorites, their Biscoff and Forrero Rocher are also delicious! 

The owners are absolute sweet hearts! I&apos;ve heard the empanadas are amazing as well. I haven&apos;t personally tried them yet but plan too. If you haven&apos;t visited Bistro yet, make it a point to!"
5,Back at it again. Third time this week and every time has been delightful. This place has the best ice cream and the best drinks.
5,Absolutely love the sweets at Bistro 6050.  Ice Cream is great and the Crepes are dee-licious.   Service is top-notch and the overall vibe is warm and cozy so looking forward to dining in when that&apos;s available again.
5,"A friend of mine who lives in the area recommended this place so I stopped by on a hot day and wanted a fruity tea drink.  Because, it&apos;s my first time I wanted to order several things so Chris recommended several items. During our short conversation he offered me free samples and truly awesome recommendations. The Nutella milkshake was a delight and the guava tea was very refreshing . Then ice cream samples were amazing and the nuts was very different and a very healthy snack.  I really liked that Chris took his time to explain everything to me and recommend specific time.  I haven&apos;t tried everything but I will definitely be back to try everything on the menu!"
5,"STILL the Best place in Chicago for so many things!  Come for the Empanadas!  Stay for the Homemade Ice Cream!  Truly, the best ice cream I&apos;ve ever had comes from the Bistro!  Try the new chocolate+coffee+marshmallow+Nutella+chocochips=CHOCOMARNUTCHIP , it&apos;s my new favorite, so rich and delish.

Crepes are amazing too, teas and coffee, Shakes and More!  Don&apos;t miss out!"
5,"Seems like there&apos;s enough 5 stars so I&apos;ll keep this as a list for my own future orders.

Barbacoa - hearty and tastes a little like sloppy joe with a kick
Ham and Cheese - tastes like ham and cheese
Cheesy Pepperjelly - tastes like the sauce! Very interesting
Spinach Ricotta - probably one of the more bland ones
TSAP - tastes like Indian Samosa. Just potato blend but nice flavor
Spanish Chorizo - more subtle than expected but I really liked it
Pinoyski Chicken - Tasty! 
Pulled Pork - &quot;distinct taste&quot; says husband"
5,"Our first trying it and we loved it. The owner helped was super nice and sweet and welcomed us to the neighborhood. We tried the ube shake, passion fruit bubble tea, crapes and tree different empanadas. Can&apos;t wait to go back and order some more, they have so many choices :)"
5,"We been coming to Bistro 6050 for years and always everything is amazing !!! If you like to support small local businesses definitely this is the place to come,  either if you have the craving for coffee, a burger or and ice cream."
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try Bistro 6050 for a while and ended up getting takeout twice this week. I love how they have the front door set up for pick up. 

We tried ice cream first and the coconut and raspberry with chips were both delicious! Later in the week we picked up empanadas, and each was great! Will be back!"
4,"Based on a side conversation with Phil S, I decided to stop by and check out Bistro 6050.  The location is easy enough to get to on Irving Park and in a good location as it is not too close to the stop light at Austin, which gets very crowded and makes crossing the street or getting out of your car a somewhat dangerous ordeal.  If you have ever parked there, you will know what I mean.  I was able to cross the street and live to tell the tale.

The place itself is very cute once you get inside.  There are plenty of tables if you chose to dine in, but quite frankly this is food I would want to take home and enjoy in the comfort of my home with some bubbles.  I loved that there were two nice size stuffed chairs where I could sit and wait for my order.

Because I was hungry and Phil&apos;s review said that he wished the empanadas were bigger, I order three of each of the following:  barbacoa, creamy chicken, spinach ricotta, TSAP (traditional south asian potato), ham/cheese and the pulled porky. In addition I ordered the barbacoa, creamy chicken and asian chicken adobo.  Full disclosure, since I was doing take out, I figured that I would do the full monty and get t all.  No way me and The Doctor were going to eat all of this, but figured I would have lunch and dinner for the next few days.

The young lady who assisted me seemed surprise at the amount I was ordering and wanted to know if I was having a party...HAHAHAHA!  Very cute.  She was very helpful in taking my order and provided me with a free sweet tea made from Earl Grey.  I have never done EG cold, but gotta say I loved it.  The other nice thing was that they were playing this incredible jazz music; that coupled with the comfy chair and iced tea made the time go by fast. I had parked on the meter and had added 30 mins from my phone app, which was perfect.  She actually checked to see if I was on a meter to make sure I didn&apos;t run out of time while they prepared my food.

I love that the empanadas are baked, not fried and that they had these little identifiers on them (flower, triangle,star, square, etc.) to help tell which was which.  The top of the containers had hand written descriptions and drawing of the little identifiers to allow you to decipher what was in each container.  They also came with a pepper jelly dipping sauce.  Three empanadas are $8.95; while they seemed small, I got full on what I had.  The pastry was nice and light and baking added a cleaner flavor than what you would get from being fried in oil.

The crepes were also very nice, light with a slightly sweet taste to them.  The pepper jelly was not what I expected...it was sweet.  The Doctor liked it but I didn&apos;t use any as it was too sweet for me (just my personal taste, nothing against the jelly).  I had to travel another 28 mins to get home due to traffic, but I am happy to report that the food was still warm.  The Doctor and I tried everything but the spinach/TSAP and the Creamy Chicken crepes. Saving those for tomorrow.

I would say the barbacoa was nice, tender and a different flavor since it wasn&apos;t prepared like I am used to from Mexican restaurants, but delicious none the less.  Pulled Porky and Creamy Chicken were good as well, very nice blending of subtle flavors without overpowering the meat and pastry.

The crepes were great and well prepared (speaking as someone who makes crepes).  I did not require a knife to eat the crepes, which goes towards how tender the crepe and meat were.  I think next time I will try one of the dessert crepes.  I don&apos;t usually do dessert but they have a chocolate and coconut one, two of my favorite flavors (I still dream about that chocolate coconut cake from the now closed Booth One).

Gotta say this was a pleasant surprise for me and it was on the way home.  I don&apos;t go this way home all the time, but this place could get me to alter my route every now and then."
5,"Best ice cream! So creamy! I especially love the flavors Ferraro Rocher, Biscoff (like a caramel flavored cookie), raspberry good (raspberry ice cream with chocolate chips)"
5,"The best attention, the best ice creams ever!!! Amazing! You have to pass by if you&apos;re in Chicago!
Attended by its Belgian owner, such a great business man! Thank you for all suggestions and kind words late at night!! 
(One of the Venezuelan ladies of Saturday night, and Sunday!)"
5,"The beauty of mom and pop restaurants are not only the outstanding customer service that it provides, but also, the fresh ingredients that the restaurant are almost and usually guarantees to deliver. 

As I discovered the restaurant by yelp searching on a late night for some bad craving for sweets, Bostro 6050 was the first pop out. The outside of the shop may not look like much, but if you do drive slowly you would definitely spot it easily . I could go on to talk about the interior of the restaurant but I am sure that not what we are here for . So let&apos;s just dive right in : 

Service: absolutely outstanding since both owner(the wife and the husband) make sure you are being take good care of. 

Parking : street parking are easier to be found

Food: 

Gelato is a must in the menu specially the pistachio flavor, you might noticed the color is not as &quot;vibrant&quot; as the super market brand(but that&apos;s because they use the real deal instead of food coloring ). Also, their per-scoop size aren&apos;t the same as store brands, but trust me, you are tasting the concentrated version of gelato(literally). Which I also recommend the Rose flavor just cause no where else had it (that&apos;s if you want to be more advantageous). Their empanadas are also very outstanding! I am not much of a pork person but the Barbacoa are delicious. 

If you are looking for something different, fresh and local, give them a try! As both of the restaurant owners will tell you everything about their proudly productions . 

P.S: and no, they did not pay me for speaking so highly of them, I am just genuinely promoting business owners that are truly passion with their business."
5,"My wife&apos;s former co worker told me about Bistro 6050 awhile ago so I bookmarked it.  Well tonight I decided to stop by and check it out 5 Stars on 203 reviews impressive.  What&apos;s the scoop?  8:15pm and the place is packed.  They seem to be a little short staffed cause the poor girl in the front seems to be totally overwhelmed, scrambling &amp; frazzled to keep up w/the demand for drinks, ice cream, crepes &amp; coffees.  The empanadas are prepared &amp; cooked in the back.  Each order placed is served piping hot &amp; fresh.  

Bistro 6059 is kind of a cool place sort of a 50&apos;s Style diner w/old time music playing.  

* Creamy Chicken - Peruvian Style cooking W/dairies, imported yellow hot peppers &amp; spicy.  Absolutely remarkable (my Favorite one)
* Barbacoa - slow cooked beef for 6hrs mixed w/herbs &amp; spices w/a little kick.  Very good soft seasoned beef that melts in your mouth
* Spinach Ricotta - spinach, ricotta, mozzarella &amp; Parmesan cheeses (least favorite)

The empanadas were excellent and probably the best commercially made empanadas I ever had.  I will definitely be back again very soon.  The only thing is I wish they were a little bigger."
5,"We ordered delivery from here tonight on Grubhub and were blown away by the quality! We tried the crepes, empanadas, shakes, coffee &amp; even horchata!

Every single item was purely delicious and had a unique flavor that impressed my whole family! The banana &amp; Nutella crepes were light, fluffy &amp; packed with Nutella goodness. The lime crepe literally blew my mind. It&apos;s basically key lime pie in a crepe. It was delicate, light, and had the perfect tart lime flavor.

Spinach &amp; ricotta empanadas were flaky and they came with the most amazing pepper relish dipping sauce that made them even tastier. We are so excited to try different flavors the next time!

The Oreo milkshake was to die for. I don&apos;t even know how they get it to taste so good. It had such a deep &amp; rich flavor. But it wasn&apos;t overly thick like other milkshakes. It had the perfect consistency and Oreo blended throughout.

My sister tried their &quot;hot horchata&quot; which was basically like hot chocolate except horchata flavored! Omg! How unique and so tasty. She said it was her favorite thing.

So happy we tried this place! You can really tell each and every item is prepared with care and consideration. It&apos;s hard to find home cooking this good nowadays. So glad we have this neighborhood gem!!"

The crust is perfectly thin to let the fillings shine through. The fillings themselves are well seasoned and balanced. Dipping sauce was a sweet and spicy sauce that was a great compliment to the empanadas! 

Ice cream: I&apos;ll admit it. I&apos;ve been a Jeni&apos;s fan girl, but this ice cream is something worth writing home about. We got the pistachio and chocolate ice cream. I love a pistachio that doesn&apos;t pretend to be almond or cherry - it&apos;s just pure roasted nuttiness. And the chocolate. Heavenly, rich, creamy chocolate! So good. 

Our hearts and bellies are happy. We will be back!"
5,"I normally don&apos;t take the time to leave reviews, but felt the need to with this one. 
I ordered delivery and never really have high hopes when it comes to having food delivered from most places since the quality can change a bit when placed in a container and the added time to get to you. 
However, from the minute I received my order (my first time ever) from them I couldn&apos;t help but have a big smile. They wrote the sweetest message on the box as well as the symbols for each empanada. So cute!
Now to the food. I ordered the ham &amp; cheese, sweet corn chat masala, pulled porky and a passion fruit tea. SO GOOD. The empanada crust was perfect, the fillings were flavorful and the tea was refreshing. Definitely add them to your list of places to try!"
5,"Discovered this place by accident and couldn&apos;t be more glad that I did. Their ice creams are to die for. Every flavor I have had, has been nothing short of exception in taste and quality of ingredients. I would save I buy 4 pints ever 2-3 months and I wouldn&apos;t be upset if that average increases especially come summer time. 

Amazing people, amazing quality, amazing place!"
5,"Bistro 6050 is such a cute little spot for a quick sweet or salty treat! 

The menu is SO extensive ranging from empanadas to burgers to crepes and ice cream. I really like that there are a few vegetarian empanadas available. I didn&apos;t try any this time but I&apos;m looking forward to trying a couple next visit! 

To crave my sweet tooth, I ordered the banana Nutella crepes. The French velvet crepes were spot on! I especially liked how the crepes were not paper thin. They held their shape/structure which made them enjoyable to eat. The decadent Nutella filling added quite a punch. Banana flavor was not overpowering. I recommend these for people with a chocolate craving. 

I really enjoy how each item has a handwritten message. &quot;Hello beautiful&quot; was written on my crepe box  and &quot;stay cute&quot; on the side of my friends milkshake. It is such a unique gesture that I haven&apos;t seen anywhere else. Major brownie points."
5,"This is probably my favourite restaurant right now and I don&apos;t pick favourites often. Every time I order from here, I get at least six of the peruvian chicken emps. I&apos;m honestly obsessed with them. This place is speedy, always accurate, and they often leave little notes written on my containers. It&apos;s like the old days when your mum had wished you a great day on a sticky note stashed in your lunch box for school...

Sorry, that was weird. In short, I LOVE THIS PLACE. My only complaint is  that it isn&apos;t closer!

With love,
   Sonii"
5,"Hands down, this is literally one of the best local spots on the northwest side of the city. Their ice cream is to die for! Interesting flavors that you would never find at a Baskin Robins. Taro is personally one of my favorites, their Biscoff and Forrero Rocher are also delicious! 

The owners are absolute sweet hearts! I&apos;ve heard the empanadas are amazing as well. I haven&apos;t personally tried them yet but plan too. If you haven&apos;t visited Bistro yet, make it a point to!"
5,Back at it again. Third time this week and every time has been delightful. This place has the best ice cream and the best drinks.
5,Absolutely love the sweets at Bistro 6050.  Ice Cream is great and the Crepes are dee-licious.   Service is top-notch and the overall vibe is warm and cozy so looking forward to dining in when that&apos;s available again.
5,"A friend of mine who lives in the area recommended this place so I stopped by on a hot day and wanted a fruity tea drink.  Because, it&apos;s my first time I wanted to order several things so Chris recommended several items. During our short conversation he offered me free samples and truly awesome recommendations. The Nutella milkshake was a delight and the guava tea was very refreshing . Then ice cream samples were amazing and the nuts was very different and a very healthy snack.  I really liked that Chris took his time to explain everything to me and recommend specific time.  I haven&apos;t tried everything but I will definitely be back to try everything on the menu!"
5,"STILL the Best place in Chicago for so many things!  Come for the Empanadas!  Stay for the Homemade Ice Cream!  Truly, the best ice cream I&apos;ve ever had comes from the Bistro!  Try the new chocolate+coffee+marshmallow+Nutella+chocochips=CHOCOMARNUTCHIP , it&apos;s my new favorite, so rich and delish.

Crepes are amazing too, teas and coffee, Shakes and More!  Don&apos;t miss out!"
5,"Seems like there&apos;s enough 5 stars so I&apos;ll keep this as a list for my own future orders.

Barbacoa - hearty and tastes a little like sloppy joe with a kick
Ham and Cheese - tastes like ham and cheese
Cheesy Pepperjelly - tastes like the sauce! Very interesting
Spinach Ricotta - probably one of the more bland ones
TSAP - tastes like Indian Samosa. Just potato blend but nice flavor
Spanish Chorizo - more subtle than expected but I really liked it
Pinoyski Chicken - Tasty! 
Pulled Pork - &quot;distinct taste&quot; says husband"
5,"Our first trying it and we loved it. The owner helped was super nice and sweet and welcomed us to the neighborhood. We tried the ube shake, passion fruit bubble tea, crapes and tree different empanadas. Can&apos;t wait to go back and order some more, they have so many choices :)"
5,"We been coming to Bistro 6050 for years and always everything is amazing !!! If you like to support small local businesses definitely this is the place to come,  either if you have the craving for coffee, a burger or and ice cream."
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try Bistro 6050 for a while and ended up getting takeout twice this week. I love how they have the front door set up for pick up. 

We tried ice cream first and the coconut and raspberry with chips were both delicious! Later in the week we picked up empanadas, and each was great! Will be back!"
4,"Based on a side conversation with Phil S, I decided to stop by and check out Bistro 6050.  The location is easy enough to get to on Irving Park and in a good location as it is not too close to the stop light at Austin, which gets very crowded and makes crossing the street or getting out of your car a somewhat dangerous ordeal.  If you have ever parked there, you will know what I mean.  I was able to cross the street and live to tell the tale.

The place itself is very cute once you get inside.  There are plenty of tables if you chose to dine in, but quite frankly this is food I would want to take home and enjoy in the comfort of my home with some bubbles.  I loved that there were two nice size stuffed chairs where I could sit and wait for my order.

Because I was hungry and Phil&apos;s review said that he wished the empanadas were bigger, I order three of each of the following:  barbacoa, creamy chicken, spinach ricotta, TSAP (traditional south asian potato), ham/cheese and the pulled porky. In addition I ordered the barbacoa, creamy chicken and asian chicken adobo.  Full disclosure, since I was doing take out, I figured that I would do the full monty and get t all.  No way me and The Doctor were going to eat all of this, but figured I would have lunch and dinner for the next few days.

The young lady who assisted me seemed surprise at the amount I was ordering and wanted to know if I was having a party...HAHAHAHA!  Very cute.  She was very helpful in taking my order and provided me with a free sweet tea made from Earl Grey.  I have never done EG cold, but gotta say I loved it.  The other nice thing was that they were playing this incredible jazz music; that coupled with the comfy chair and iced tea made the time go by fast. I had parked on the meter and had added 30 mins from my phone app, which was perfect.  She actually checked to see if I was on a meter to make sure I didn&apos;t run out of time while they prepared my food.

I love that the empanadas are baked, not fried and that they had these little identifiers on them (flower, triangle,star, square, etc.) to help tell which was which.  The top of the containers had hand written descriptions and drawing of the little identifiers to allow you to decipher what was in each container.  They also came with a pepper jelly dipping sauce.  Three empanadas are $8.95; while they seemed small, I got full on what I had.  The pastry was nice and light and baking added a cleaner flavor than what you would get from being fried in oil.

The crepes were also very nice, light with a slightly sweet taste to them.  The pepper jelly was not what I expected...it was sweet.  The Doctor liked it but I didn&apos;t use any as it was too sweet for me (just my personal taste, nothing against the jelly).  I had to travel another 28 mins to get home due to traffic, but I am happy to report that the food was still warm.  The Doctor and I tried everything but the spinach/TSAP and the Creamy Chicken crepes. Saving those for tomorrow.

I would say the barbacoa was nice, tender and a different flavor since it wasn&apos;t prepared like I am used to from Mexican restaurants, but delicious none the less.  Pulled Porky and Creamy Chicken were good as well, very nice blending of subtle flavors without overpowering the meat and pastry.

The crepes were great and well prepared (speaking as someone who makes crepes).  I did not require a knife to eat the crepes, which goes towards how tender the crepe and meat were.  I think next time I will try one of the dessert crepes.  I don&apos;t usually do dessert but they have a chocolate and coconut one, two of my favorite flavors (I still dream about that chocolate coconut cake from the now closed Booth One).

Gotta say this was a pleasant surprise for me and it was on the way home.  I don&apos;t go this way home all the time, but this place could get me to alter my route every now and then."
5,"Best ice cream! So creamy! I especially love the flavors Ferraro Rocher, Biscoff (like a caramel flavored cookie), raspberry good (raspberry ice cream with chocolate chips)"
5,"The best attention, the best ice creams ever!!! Amazing! You have to pass by if you&apos;re in Chicago!
Attended by its Belgian owner, such a great business man! Thank you for all suggestions and kind words late at night!! 
(One of the Venezuelan ladies of Saturday night, and Sunday!)"
5,"The beauty of mom and pop restaurants are not only the outstanding customer service that it provides, but also, the fresh ingredients that the restaurant are almost and usually guarantees to deliver. 

As I discovered the restaurant by yelp searching on a late night for some bad craving for sweets, Bostro 6050 was the first pop out. The outside of the shop may not look like much, but if you do drive slowly you would definitely spot it easily . I could go on to talk about the interior of the restaurant but I am sure that not what we are here for . So let&apos;s just dive right in : 

Service: absolutely outstanding since both owner(the wife and the husband) make sure you are being take good care of. 

Parking : street parking are easier to be found

Food: 

Gelato is a must in the menu specially the pistachio flavor, you might noticed the color is not as &quot;vibrant&quot; as the super market brand(but that&apos;s because they use the real deal instead of food coloring ). Also, their per-scoop size aren&apos;t the same as store brands, but trust me, you are tasting the concentrated version of gelato(literally). Which I also recommend the Rose flavor just cause no where else had it (that&apos;s if you want to be more advantageous). Their empanadas are also very outstanding! I am not much of a pork person but the Barbacoa are delicious. 

If you are looking for something different, fresh and local, give them a try! As both of the restaurant owners will tell you everything about their proudly productions . 

P.S: and no, they did not pay me for speaking so highly of them, I am just genuinely promoting business owners that are truly passion with their business."
5,"My wife&apos;s former co worker told me about Bistro 6050 awhile ago so I bookmarked it.  Well tonight I decided to stop by and check it out 5 Stars on 203 reviews impressive.  What&apos;s the scoop?  8:15pm and the place is packed.  They seem to be a little short staffed cause the poor girl in the front seems to be totally overwhelmed, scrambling &amp; frazzled to keep up w/the demand for drinks, ice cream, crepes &amp; coffees.  The empanadas are prepared &amp; cooked in the back.  Each order placed is served piping hot &amp; fresh.  

Bistro 6059 is kind of a cool place sort of a 50&apos;s Style diner w/old time music playing.  

* Creamy Chicken - Peruvian Style cooking W/dairies, imported yellow hot peppers &amp; spicy.  Absolutely remarkable (my Favorite one)
* Barbacoa - slow cooked beef for 6hrs mixed w/herbs &amp; spices w/a little kick.  Very good soft seasoned beef that melts in your mouth
* Spinach Ricotta - spinach, ricotta, mozzarella &amp; Parmesan cheeses (least favorite)

The empanadas were excellent and probably the best commercially made empanadas I ever had.  I will definitely be back again very soon.  The only thing is I wish they were a little bigger."
5,"We ordered delivery from here tonight on Grubhub and were blown away by the quality! We tried the crepes, empanadas, shakes, coffee &amp; even horchata!

Every single item was purely delicious and had a unique flavor that impressed my whole family! The banana &amp; Nutella crepes were light, fluffy &amp; packed with Nutella goodness. The lime crepe literally blew my mind. It&apos;s basically key lime pie in a crepe. It was delicate, light, and had the perfect tart lime flavor.

Spinach &amp; ricotta empanadas were flaky and they came with the most amazing pepper relish dipping sauce that made them even tastier. We are so excited to try different flavors the next time!

The Oreo milkshake was to die for. I don&apos;t even know how they get it to taste so good. It had such a deep &amp; rich flavor. But it wasn&apos;t overly thick like other milkshakes. It had the perfect consistency and Oreo blended throughout.

My sister tried their &quot;hot horchata&quot; which was basically like hot chocolate except horchata flavored! Omg! How unique and so tasty. She said it was her favorite thing.

So happy we tried this place! You can really tell each and every item is prepared with care and consideration. It&apos;s hard to find home cooking this good nowadays. So glad we have this neighborhood gem!!"
5,"I can honestly say that I can count my stellar food experiences in the past 6 months on one hand. But 6050 tonight was 5 stars across the board. Boom boom boom! 

Social distancing protocol: 5 stars. Order online for no contact pickup at the window, or order through an intercom behind a window. 

Customer service: 5 stars!! One of the owners (I&apos;m assuming) was taking orders behind the window and was so sweet. I mentioned that we had recently moved into the neighborhood and they took the time to give me a Portage Park pamphlet and wrote sweet notes on the box. They also threw in an extra dipping sauce. Warm fuzzies. Warm fuzzies all around!

I ordered delivery and never really have high hopes when it comes to having food delivered from most places since the quality can change a bit when placed in a container and the added time to get to you. 
However, from the minute I received my order (my first time ever) from them I couldn&apos;t help but have a big smile. They wrote the sweetest message on the box as well as the symbols for each empanada. So cute!
Now to the food. I ordered the ham &amp; cheese, sweet corn chat masala, pulled porky and a passion fruit tea. SO GOOD. The empanada crust was perfect, the fillings were flavorful and the tea was refreshing. Definitely add them to your list of places to try!"
5,"Discovered this place by accident and couldn&apos;t be more glad that I did. Their ice creams are to die for. Every flavor I have had, has been nothing short of exception in taste and quality of ingredients. I would save I buy 4 pints ever 2-3 months and I wouldn&apos;t be upset if that average increases especially come summer time. 

Amazing people, amazing quality, amazing place!"
5,"Bistro 6050 is such a cute little spot for a quick sweet or salty treat! 

The menu is SO extensive ranging from empanadas to burgers to crepes and ice cream. I really like that there are a few vegetarian empanadas available. I didn&apos;t try any this time but I&apos;m looking forward to trying a couple next visit! 

To crave my sweet tooth, I ordered the banana Nutella crepes. The French velvet crepes were spot on! I especially liked how the crepes were not paper thin. They held their shape/structure which made them enjoyable to eat. The decadent Nutella filling added quite a punch. Banana flavor was not overpowering. I recommend these for people with a chocolate craving. 

I really enjoy how each item has a handwritten message. &quot;Hello beautiful&quot; was written on my crepe box  and &quot;stay cute&quot; on the side of my friends milkshake. It is such a unique gesture that I haven&apos;t seen anywhere else. Major brownie points."
5,"This is probably my favourite restaurant right now and I don&apos;t pick favourites often. Every time I order from here, I get at least six of the peruvian chicken emps. I&apos;m honestly obsessed with them. This place is speedy, always accurate, and they often leave little notes written on my containers. It&apos;s like the old days when your mum had wished you a great day on a sticky note stashed in your lunch box for school...

Sorry, that was weird. In short, I LOVE THIS PLACE. My only complaint is  that it isn&apos;t closer!

With love,
   Sonii"
5,"Hands down, this is literally one of the best local spots on the northwest side of the city. Their ice cream is to die for! Interesting flavors that you would never find at a Baskin Robins. Taro is personally one of my favorites, their Biscoff and Forrero Rocher are also delicious! 

The owners are absolute sweet hearts! I&apos;ve heard the empanadas are amazing as well. I haven&apos;t personally tried them yet but plan too. If you haven&apos;t visited Bistro yet, make it a point to!"
5,Back at it again. Third time this week and every time has been delightful. This place has the best ice cream and the best drinks.
5,Absolutely love the sweets at Bistro 6050.  Ice Cream is great and the Crepes are dee-licious.   Service is top-notch and the overall vibe is warm and cozy so looking forward to dining in when that&apos;s available again.
5,"A friend of mine who lives in the area recommended this place so I stopped by on a hot day and wanted a fruity tea drink.  Because, it&apos;s my first time I wanted to order several things so Chris recommended several items. During our short conversation he offered me free samples and truly awesome recommendations. The Nutella milkshake was a delight and the guava tea was very refreshing . Then ice cream samples were amazing and the nuts was very different and a very healthy snack.  I really liked that Chris took his time to explain everything to me and recommend specific time.  I haven&apos;t tried everything but I will definitely be back to try everything on the menu!"
5,"STILL the Best place in Chicago for so many things!  Come for the Empanadas!  Stay for the Homemade Ice Cream!  Truly, the best ice cream I&apos;ve ever had comes from the Bistro!  Try the new chocolate+coffee+marshmallow+Nutella+chocochips=CHOCOMARNUTCHIP , it&apos;s my new favorite, so rich and delish.

Crepes are amazing too, teas and coffee, Shakes and More!  Don&apos;t miss out!"
5,"Seems like there&apos;s enough 5 stars so I&apos;ll keep this as a list for my own future orders.

Barbacoa - hearty and tastes a little like sloppy joe with a kick
Ham and Cheese - tastes like ham and cheese
Cheesy Pepperjelly - tastes like the sauce! Very interesting
Spinach Ricotta - probably one of the more bland ones
TSAP - tastes like Indian Samosa. Just potato blend but nice flavor
Spanish Chorizo - more subtle than expected but I really liked it
Pinoyski Chicken - Tasty! 
Pulled Pork - &quot;distinct taste&quot; says husband"
5,"Our first trying it and we loved it. The owner helped was super nice and sweet and welcomed us to the neighborhood. We tried the ube shake, passion fruit bubble tea, crapes and tree different empanadas. Can&apos;t wait to go back and order some more, they have so many choices :)"
5,"We been coming to Bistro 6050 for years and always everything is amazing !!! If you like to support small local businesses definitely this is the place to come,  either if you have the craving for coffee, a burger or and ice cream."
5,"I&apos;ve been wanting to try Bistro 6050 for a while and ended up getting takeout twice this week. I love how they have the front door set up for pick up. 

We tried ice cream first and the coconut and raspberry with chips were both delicious! Later in the week we picked up empanadas, and each was great! Will be back!"
4,"Based on a side conversation with Phil S, I decided to stop by and check out Bistro 6050.  The location is easy enough to get to on Irving Park and in a good location as it is not too close to the stop light at Austin, which gets very crowded and makes crossing the street or getting out of your car a somewhat dangerous ordeal.  If you have ever parked there, you will know what I mean.  I was able to cross the street and live to tell the tale.

The place itself is very cute once you get inside.  There are plenty of tables if you chose to dine in, but quite frankly this is food I would want to take home and enjoy in the comfort of my home with some bubbles.  I loved that there were two nice size stuffed chairs where I could sit and wait for my order.

Because I was hungry and Phil&apos;s review said that he wished the empanadas were bigger, I order three of each of the following:  barbacoa, creamy chicken, spinach ricotta, TSAP (traditional south asian potato), ham/cheese and the pulled porky. In addition I ordered the barbacoa, creamy chicken and asian chicken adobo.  Full disclosure, since I was doing take out, I figured that I would do the full monty and get t all.  No way me and The Doctor were going to eat all of this, but figured I would have lunch and dinner for the next few days.

The young lady who assisted me seemed surprise at the amount I was ordering and wanted to know if I was having a party...HAHAHAHA!  Very cute.  She was very helpful in taking my order and provided me with a free sweet tea made from Earl Grey.  I have never done EG cold, but gotta say I loved it.  The other nice thing was that they were playing this incredible jazz music; that coupled with the comfy chair and iced tea made the time go by fast. I had parked on the meter and had added 30 mins from my phone app, which was perfect.  She actually checked to see if I was on a meter to make sure I didn&apos;t run out of time while they prepared my food.

I love that the empanadas are baked, not fried and that they had these little identifiers on them (flower, triangle,star, square, etc.) to help tell which was which.  The top of the containers had hand written descriptions and drawing of the little identifiers to allow you to decipher what was in each container.  They also came with a pepper jelly dipping sauce.  Three empanadas are $8.95; while they seemed small, I got full on what I had.  The pastry was nice and light and baking added a cleaner flavor than what you would get from being fried in oil.

The crepes were also very nice, light with a slightly sweet taste to them.  The pepper jelly was not what I expected...it was sweet.  The Doctor liked it but I didn&apos;t use any as it was too sweet for me (just my personal taste, nothing against the jelly).  I had to travel another 28 mins to get home due to traffic, but I am happy to report that the food was still warm.  The Doctor and I tried everything but the spinach/TSAP and the Creamy Chicken crepes. Saving those for tomorrow.

I would say the barbacoa was nice, tender and a different flavor since it wasn&apos;t prepared like I am used to from Mexican restaurants, but delicious none the less.  Pulled Porky and Creamy Chicken were good as well, very nice blending of subtle flavors without overpowering the meat and pastry.

The crepes were great and well prepared (speaking as someone who makes crepes).  I did not require a knife to eat the crepes, which goes towards how tender the crepe and meat were.  I think next time I will try one of the dessert crepes.  I don&apos;t usually do dessert but they have a chocolate and coconut one, two of my favorite flavors (I still dream about that chocolate coconut cake from the now closed Booth One).

Gotta say this was a pleasant surprise for me and it was on the way home.  I don&apos;t go this way home all the time, but this place could get me to alter my route every now and then."
5,"Best ice cream! So creamy! I especially love the flavors Ferraro Rocher, Biscoff (like a caramel flavored cookie), raspberry good (raspberry ice cream with chocolate chips)"
5,"The best attention, the best ice creams ever!!! Amazing! You have to pass by if you&apos;re in Chicago!
Attended by its Belgian owner, such a great business man! Thank you for all suggestions and kind words late at night!! 
(One of the Venezuelan ladies of Saturday night, and Sunday!)"
5,"The beauty of mom and pop restaurants are not only the outstanding customer service that it provides, but also, the fresh ingredients that the restaurant are almost and usually guarantees to deliver. 

As I discovered the restaurant by yelp searching on a late night for some bad craving for sweets, Bostro 6050 was the first pop out. The outside of the shop may not look like much, but if you do drive slowly you would definitely spot it easily . I could go on to talk about the interior of the restaurant but I am sure that not what we are here for . So let&apos;s just dive right in : 

Service: absolutely outstanding since both owner(the wife and the husband) make sure you are being take good care of. 

Parking : street parking are easier to be found

Food: 

Gelato is a must in the menu specially the pistachio flavor, you might noticed the color is not as &quot;vibrant&quot; as the super market brand(but that&apos;s because they use the real deal instead of food coloring ). Also, their per-scoop size aren&apos;t the same as store brands, but trust me, you are tasting the concentrated version of gelato(literally). Which I also recommend the Rose flavor just cause no where else had it (that&apos;s if you want to be more advantageous). Their empanadas are also very outstanding! I am not much of a pork person but the Barbacoa are delicious. 

If you are looking for something different, fresh and local, give them a try! As both of the restaurant owners will tell you everything about their proudly productions . 

P.S: and no, they did not pay me for speaking so highly of them, I am just genuinely promoting business owners that are truly passion with their business."
5,"My wife&apos;s former co worker told me about Bistro 6050 awhile ago so I bookmarked it.  Well tonight I decided to stop by and check it out 5 Stars on 203 reviews impressive.  What&apos;s the scoop?  8:15pm and the place is packed.  They seem to be a little short staffed cause the poor girl in the front seems to be totally overwhelmed, scrambling &amp; frazzled to keep up w/the demand for drinks, ice cream, crepes &amp; coffees.  The empanadas are prepared &amp; cooked in the back.  Each order placed is served piping hot &amp; fresh.  

Bistro 6059 is kind of a cool place sort of a 50&apos;s Style diner w/old time music playing.  

* Creamy Chicken - Peruvian Style cooking W/dairies, imported yellow hot peppers &amp; spicy.  Absolutely remarkable (my Favorite one)
* Barbacoa - slow cooked beef for 6hrs mixed w/herbs &amp; spices w/a little kick.  Very good soft seasoned beef that melts in your mouth
* Spinach Ricotta - spinach, ricotta, mozzarella &amp; Parmesan cheeses (least favorite)

The empanadas were excellent and probably the best commercially made empanadas I ever had.  I will definitely be back again very soon.  The only thing is I wish they were a little bigger."
5,"We ordered delivery from here tonight on Grubhub and were blown away by the quality! We tried the crepes, empanadas, shakes, coffee &amp; even horchata!

Every single item was purely delicious and had a unique flavor that impressed my whole family! The banana &amp; Nutella crepes were light, fluffy &amp; packed with Nutella goodness. The lime crepe literally blew my mind. It&apos;s basically key lime pie in a crepe. It was delicate, light, and had the perfect tart lime flavor.

Spinach &amp; ricotta empanadas were flaky and they came with the most amazing pepper relish dipping sauce that made them even tastier. We are so excited to try different flavors the next time!

The Oreo milkshake was to die for. I don&apos;t even know how they get it to taste so good. It had such a deep &amp; rich flavor. But it wasn&apos;t overly thick like other milkshakes. It had the perfect consistency and Oreo blended throughout.

My sister tried their &quot;hot horchata&quot; which was basically like hot chocolate except horchata flavored! Omg! How unique and so tasty. She said it was her favorite thing.

So happy we tried this place! You can really tell each and every item is prepared with care and consideration. It&apos;s hard to find home cooking this good nowadays. So glad we have this neighborhood gem!!"
5,"I can honestly say that I can count my stellar food experiences in the past 6 months on one hand. But 6050 tonight was 5 stars across the board. Boom boom boom! 

Social distancing protocol: 5 stars. Order online for no contact pickup at the window, or order through an intercom behind a window. 

Customer service: 5 stars!! One of the owners (I&apos;m assuming) was taking orders behind the window and was so sweet. I mentioned that we had recently moved into the neighborhood and they took the time to give me a Portage Park pamphlet and wrote sweet notes on the box. They also threw in an extra dipping sauce. Warm fuzzies. Warm fuzzies all around! 

Empanadas: 5 stars. Lots of unique flavors to choose from. We got the porky, chaat, and chorizo. Ugh. Warm. Flakey. Crisp, but also soft and chewy. The crust is perfectly thin to let the fillings shine through. The fillings themselves are well seasoned and balanced. Dipping sauce was a sweet and spicy sauce that was a great compliment to the empanadas! 

Ice cream: I&apos;ll admit it. I&apos;ve been a Jeni&apos;s fan girl, but this ice cream is something worth writing home about. We got the pistachio and chocolate ice cream. I love a pistachio that doesn&apos;t pretend to be almond or cherry - it&apos;s just pure roasted nuttiness. And the chocolate. Heavenly, rich, creamy chocolate! So good. 

Our hearts and bellies are happy. We will be back!"
