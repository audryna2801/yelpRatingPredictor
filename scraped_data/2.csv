Futhermore, additionally, and also they need more variety. As a poor and hungry college kid, I can only eat the same thing everyday for a limited time. It has been 2 years, and i am so frustrated i want to impale the tables with the plastic cutlery they provide. 

In other words, i am very upset that they tuck the chairs in at the corners of the tables. Drives me crazy because you cant walk through the cafeteria, and no one questions it??????? I am so anger. 

I have attached an examplar photo."
