4,"Ordered delivery on a chilly night in. I&apos;ve had Art of Pizza multiple times in the past and was a big fan. This time I felt that there was a lot of cheese and not enough toppings or sauce. We ordered 12 inch stuffed pizza with gardinera and spinach - either there wasn&apos;t enough toppings or too much cheese to really taste them. The 12 in was way too much for a group of three, but deep dish leftovers are something I always look forward to!

Hoping next time we have a better experience! 

FYI great if you want deep dish by the slice! This is the only place I know that does this"
4,"Ordered delivery (speedy!) from here last weekend with my husband. We received a 14 inch thin crust with mushrooms, onion, pepper, and sausage (enough for 4 people!). It was very tasty but we both wished there was more sauce. The cheese to sauce ratio was a bit off. However, we will absolutely order from them again and try the infamous deep dish pizza!!"
4,"First time trying and hearing about this place. My friend ordered a delivery of the southwestern pizza with pineapple and mushroom I think. We also got a side of fried mushrooms and fried jalape√±o poppers. Pizza was absolutely flavorful and delicious! It was extremely cheesy and the ratio of crust to filling+toppings and sauce was perfect! I&apos;d definitely try more of their pizzas. Their sides were good too but nothing extraordinary. Overall, great place for pizza!"
4,"Coming from someone who prefers NY style over Chicago, I am impressed. Over the years, I&apos;ve given various Chicago places and styles tries and they all have their pros and cons. I definitely don&apos;t dig the thin crust anywhere, so I got the pan pizza in this instance. The dough is really tasty and the sauce is outstanding. Better than a lot of other places, to my memory. Still a lot of dough to my general liking, but I enjoyed it.

What knocked it out of the park for me was the meatball sub. The sub only comes with two enormous balls (I&apos;d prefer them a little more bite size, so they can fit in my mouth) but nevertheless they were juicy and full of flavor. 

Should I order from these guys again (and I plan to) I reckon that a stuffed will yield similar results, as well as the other sandwiches. With the meatball sub the main crux of my meal, I only had one slice of the pan... so I look forward to future snacks and meals with the bounty of leftover."
1,The last two times I ordered from here the toppings were bland and skimpy. Nothing had much taste other than seasoning that was shook  onto the top of the pizza. Won&apos;t be ordering again.
5,"Again Awesome stuffed pizza. Wow!! We had the arts special which is loaded with tons of cheese, peppers, onions, mushrooms and sausage covered with fresh Mariana sauce that is incredible. We got a whole pie and it was half eaten by the time we got home. 

Regarding customer service. I&apos;ve had no problems when the person takes my over the phone order. I walk in, pay, get my food and leave, please and thank you. Haven&apos;t met any rudeness that others have mentioned"
3,"I really wanted to like them more overall since so many reviews spoke highly of them! We called in an order on a week night for 9pm since it was one of the few spots that were opened late. When I spoke to the man on the phone, his tone was brass and harsh as I ordered for a beef and sausage sandwich combo since it was the special that night. And he yells on the phone &quot;wait huh, you wanted a what!?&quot; He came off as wanting to rush me placing my order which was a little frustrating. I also ordered the meaty delight thin sliced pizza in 14 inch. We went to pick up the pizza and the guy at the front desk told us we had to wait for our food since it wasn&apos;t ready. When he told us it was finally ready, he gave us a completely wrong pizza order that was under the same name. Turns out our food had been ready all long. The food was overall fine, I didn&apos;t honestly find anything super special about the sandwich and pizza. The meaty delight pizza had your meats of bacon, ground beef, pepperoni, sliced beef, and sausage. I maybe would like to come back to try some of the highly recommended dishes some other time to give it another shot."
2,"I have been so excited to try this place as I have heard such great things about both their deep dish as well as their regular pizza. Ordered pickup and wanted to try one of each style since people have raved about both! Got a meaty deep dish and sausage, onion, and green pepper regular style. I really wanted to love it but I was let down as both pizzas overall were very dry. There was very little sauce on both pizzas making both of them very underwhelming. Overall, both pizza were very dry and bland - but it was filling. Total $46."
3,"I had super high hopes for this place given what I&apos;ve read and heard from the internet and friends. I went with a couple buddies of mine last Sunday to pick up food to eat while watching football. We ordered two pizzas (both deep dish) one pepperoni, and one of their signature topping combo. We got an Italian beef combo, and my friend ordered a basket of wings and fries.

The beef was pretty good, probably on par with a Portillos or so, the pizzas were nothing special. I love a good thick crust/deep dish pie, but these were so thick that the dough was 70% of the pizza, and it was not thoroughly cooked. The fries were soggy and pedestrian.

The real issue with this otherwise pretty good pizza shop were the wings. Holy hell, literally just don&apos;t put wings on the menu if this is your offering. They only have BBQ wings as an option as opposed to buffalo, which if they&apos;re good, that&apos;s fine, but these wings were glorified frozen chicken wings covered in ketchup. Borderline inedible.

Service was great, employees were friendly, and order was prompt and correct. I would try the place again now knowing what to avoid, and what to get."
5,One of my favorite places for deep dish/pizza pie. Tomato sauce is really flavorful and toppings fresh. Just the right amount of cheese - not too much or too little. No frills - can buy by the slice which is nice when you&apos;re craving deep dish but don&apos;t want an entire pie. Free parking in small lot right out front.
5,"This place has some of the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! I got the stuffed pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, spinach, tomato, and garlic. The toppings are all in the middle of the pizza rather than on top. It was definitely the thickest deep dish pizza I&apos;ve ever had. The crust was also soft but hard enough to hold up the shape of the pizza. It definitely comes close to Lou Malnatis but I&apos;m not sure it can beat it. It is almost a different type of deep dish altogether compared to Lous and I still think everyone should try it and compare for themselves!"
1,"As I&apos;ve been to the Ashland location several times, today was a disgusting surprise... I always stop by if I&apos;m in the neighborhood, given I live in Schaumburg, however, this time I was truly surprised by the low quality ingredients as the sausage was raw.... needless to say food poisoning was part of the menu today.  Fair warning to all patrons, have your pizza fully cooked ... I&apos;m disappointed with the quality the kitchen has been serving"
1,"I JUST HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE HERE. Ordered a pizza online through THEIR WEBSITE at 6pm, arrived at the restaurant at 7pm to pick up my pizza which I was told via their online tracking system was going to be ready at 7:05. One of the cashiers told me they never received the ticket on their system, they couldn&apos;t move my pizza to the front and they couldn&apos;t offer me anything (they literally didn&apos;t even offer me a free slice of pizza). My only option was to wait another 45 minutes for it to be ready. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I&apos;VE EXPERIENCED IN A WHILE. Certainly won&apos;t be trying their pizza now."
5,Tried their deep dish and it was DELICIOUS! Hands down the best stuffed I&apos;ve had and I&apos;m Chicago born and raised.
5,"Woah, first time ordering from here. I ordered The thin crust version of ART&apos;S MEATY DELIGHT pizza with extra cheese well done. 
Probably the best pizza I&apos;ve had in a long time, and the best I&apos;ve had since living in the city. LOTS of meat, they didn&apos;t skip, and when I said extra cheese I got that extra cheese. Lots of flavor, love that they weren&apos;t scared to use oregano. 

I&apos;ll definitely order again, may try the stuffed version next time."
2,"Could have been much better, they rely on more cheese for the rating. Very Avg taste"
5,"First time trying this place and we were completely satisfied. We ordered the pan and it was more like a deep dish (which was completely fine with us!). Unlike other pizza places, Art of Pizza loaded our pizza with toppings and lots of cheese (it reflected in the price). Will definitely order again!"
5,"Came here with my husband after he raved about Chicago style pizza for years! This is his fav pizza place in all of Chicago area, and it did not disappoint. We got the Art&apos;s Special (and entire pizza for dine in), and holy cow it was delicious. Staff was super friendly and happy to hear how much we love the place. 100% recommend you visit this location, can&apos;t vouch for the other location on State St (under different ownership). Also pizza by the slice. YUMMMM"
3,"Ordered delivery here a couple weekends ago.  The pizza was solid but unexceptional. Pizza and crust could have used some flavor. 

The sandwich we ordered was good - toppings, especially the meat, were good. 

Overall, pretty average, so we were a bit let down given the high reviews and good recommendations."
1,"Don&apos;t bother. 
Mediocre food, which is ok since their prices are cheap.
But the employees don&apos;t care and they give THE WORST service. 

Wherever you live, wherever you are, I guarantee there are at least a few italian restaurants around. Order from there, I promise the food will be at least as good, and the service has to be better.

Regarding customer service. I&apos;ve had no problems when the person takes my over the phone order. I walk in, pay, get my food and leave, please and thank you. Haven&apos;t met any rudeness that others have mentioned"
3,"I really wanted to like them more overall since so many reviews spoke highly of them! We called in an order on a week night for 9pm since it was one of the few spots that were opened late. When I spoke to the man on the phone, his tone was brass and harsh as I ordered for a beef and sausage sandwich combo since it was the special that night. And he yells on the phone &quot;wait huh, you wanted a what!?&quot; He came off as wanting to rush me placing my order which was a little frustrating. I also ordered the meaty delight thin sliced pizza in 14 inch. We went to pick up the pizza and the guy at the front desk told us we had to wait for our food since it wasn&apos;t ready. When he told us it was finally ready, he gave us a completely wrong pizza order that was under the same name. Turns out our food had been ready all long. The food was overall fine, I didn&apos;t honestly find anything super special about the sandwich and pizza. The meaty delight pizza had your meats of bacon, ground beef, pepperoni, sliced beef, and sausage. I maybe would like to come back to try some of the highly recommended dishes some other time to give it another shot."
2,"I have been so excited to try this place as I have heard such great things about both their deep dish as well as their regular pizza. Ordered pickup and wanted to try one of each style since people have raved about both! Got a meaty deep dish and sausage, onion, and green pepper regular style. I really wanted to love it but I was let down as both pizzas overall were very dry. There was very little sauce on both pizzas making both of them very underwhelming. Overall, both pizza were very dry and bland - but it was filling. Total $46."
3,"I had super high hopes for this place given what I&apos;ve read and heard from the internet and friends. I went with a couple buddies of mine last Sunday to pick up food to eat while watching football. We ordered two pizzas (both deep dish) one pepperoni, and one of their signature topping combo. We got an Italian beef combo, and my friend ordered a basket of wings and fries.

The beef was pretty good, probably on par with a Portillos or so, the pizzas were nothing special. I love a good thick crust/deep dish pie, but these were so thick that the dough was 70% of the pizza, and it was not thoroughly cooked. The fries were soggy and pedestrian.

The real issue with this otherwise pretty good pizza shop were the wings. Holy hell, literally just don&apos;t put wings on the menu if this is your offering. They only have BBQ wings as an option as opposed to buffalo, which if they&apos;re good, that&apos;s fine, but these wings were glorified frozen chicken wings covered in ketchup. Borderline inedible.

Service was great, employees were friendly, and order was prompt and correct. I would try the place again now knowing what to avoid, and what to get."
5,One of my favorite places for deep dish/pizza pie. Tomato sauce is really flavorful and toppings fresh. Just the right amount of cheese - not too much or too little. No frills - can buy by the slice which is nice when you&apos;re craving deep dish but don&apos;t want an entire pie. Free parking in small lot right out front.
5,"This place has some of the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! I got the stuffed pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, spinach, tomato, and garlic. The toppings are all in the middle of the pizza rather than on top. It was definitely the thickest deep dish pizza I&apos;ve ever had. The crust was also soft but hard enough to hold up the shape of the pizza. It definitely comes close to Lou Malnatis but I&apos;m not sure it can beat it. It is almost a different type of deep dish altogether compared to Lous and I still think everyone should try it and compare for themselves!"
1,"As I&apos;ve been to the Ashland location several times, today was a disgusting surprise... I always stop by if I&apos;m in the neighborhood, given I live in Schaumburg, however, this time I was truly surprised by the low quality ingredients as the sausage was raw.... needless to say food poisoning was part of the menu today.  Fair warning to all patrons, have your pizza fully cooked ... I&apos;m disappointed with the quality the kitchen has been serving"
1,"I JUST HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE HERE. Ordered a pizza online through THEIR WEBSITE at 6pm, arrived at the restaurant at 7pm to pick up my pizza which I was told via their online tracking system was going to be ready at 7:05. One of the cashiers told me they never received the ticket on their system, they couldn&apos;t move my pizza to the front and they couldn&apos;t offer me anything (they literally didn&apos;t even offer me a free slice of pizza). My only option was to wait another 45 minutes for it to be ready. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I&apos;VE EXPERIENCED IN A WHILE. Certainly won&apos;t be trying their pizza now."
5,Tried their deep dish and it was DELICIOUS! Hands down the best stuffed I&apos;ve had and I&apos;m Chicago born and raised.
5,"Woah, first time ordering from here. I ordered The thin crust version of ART&apos;S MEATY DELIGHT pizza with extra cheese well done. 
Probably the best pizza I&apos;ve had in a long time, and the best I&apos;ve had since living in the city. LOTS of meat, they didn&apos;t skip, and when I said extra cheese I got that extra cheese. Lots of flavor, love that they weren&apos;t scared to use oregano. 

I&apos;ll definitely order again, may try the stuffed version next time."
2,"Could have been much better, they rely on more cheese for the rating. Very Avg taste"
5,"First time trying this place and we were completely satisfied. We ordered the pan and it was more like a deep dish (which was completely fine with us!). Unlike other pizza places, Art of Pizza loaded our pizza with toppings and lots of cheese (it reflected in the price). Will definitely order again!"
5,"Came here with my husband after he raved about Chicago style pizza for years! This is his fav pizza place in all of Chicago area, and it did not disappoint. We got the Art&apos;s Special (and entire pizza for dine in), and holy cow it was delicious. Staff was super friendly and happy to hear how much we love the place. 100% recommend you visit this location, can&apos;t vouch for the other location on State St (under different ownership). Also pizza by the slice. YUMMMM"
3,"Ordered delivery here a couple weekends ago.  The pizza was solid but unexceptional. Pizza and crust could have used some flavor. 

The sandwich we ordered was good - toppings, especially the meat, were good. 

Overall, pretty average, so we were a bit let down given the high reviews and good recommendations."
1,"Don&apos;t bother. 
Mediocre food, which is ok since their prices are cheap.
But the employees don&apos;t care and they give THE WORST service. 

Wherever you live, wherever you are, I guarantee there are at least a few italian restaurants around. Order from there, I promise the food will be at least as good, and the service has to be better.

Gads"
4,"Ordered delivery on a chilly night in. I&apos;ve had Art of Pizza multiple times in the past and was a big fan. This time I felt that there was a lot of cheese and not enough toppings or sauce. We ordered 12 inch stuffed pizza with gardinera and spinach - either there wasn&apos;t enough toppings or too much cheese to really taste them. The 12 in was way too much for a group of three, but deep dish leftovers are something I always look forward to!

Hoping next time we have a better experience! 

FYI great if you want deep dish by the slice! This is the only place I know that does this"
4,"Ordered delivery (speedy!) from here last weekend with my husband. We received a 14 inch thin crust with mushrooms, onion, pepper, and sausage (enough for 4 people!). It was very tasty but we both wished there was more sauce. The cheese to sauce ratio was a bit off. However, we will absolutely order from them again and try the infamous deep dish pizza!!"
4,"First time trying and hearing about this place. My friend ordered a delivery of the southwestern pizza with pineapple and mushroom I think. We also got a side of fried mushrooms and fried jalape√±o poppers. Pizza was absolutely flavorful and delicious! It was extremely cheesy and the ratio of crust to filling+toppings and sauce was perfect! I&apos;d definitely try more of their pizzas. Their sides were good too but nothing extraordinary. Overall, great place for pizza!"
4,"Coming from someone who prefers NY style over Chicago, I am impressed. Over the years, I&apos;ve given various Chicago places and styles tries and they all have their pros and cons. I definitely don&apos;t dig the thin crust anywhere, so I got the pan pizza in this instance. The dough is really tasty and the sauce is outstanding. Better than a lot of other places, to my memory. Still a lot of dough to my general liking, but I enjoyed it.

What knocked it out of the park for me was the meatball sub. The sub only comes with two enormous balls (I&apos;d prefer them a little more bite size, so they can fit in my mouth) but nevertheless they were juicy and full of flavor. 

Should I order from these guys again (and I plan to) I reckon that a stuffed will yield similar results, as well as the other sandwiches. With the meatball sub the main crux of my meal, I only had one slice of the pan... so I look forward to future snacks and meals with the bounty of leftover."

The beef was pretty good, probably on par with a Portillos or so, the pizzas were nothing special. I love a good thick crust/deep dish pie, but these were so thick that the dough was 70% of the pizza, and it was not thoroughly cooked. The fries were soggy and pedestrian.

The real issue with this otherwise pretty good pizza shop were the wings. Holy hell, literally just don&apos;t put wings on the menu if this is your offering. They only have BBQ wings as an option as opposed to buffalo, which if they&apos;re good, that&apos;s fine, but these wings were glorified frozen chicken wings covered in ketchup. Borderline inedible.

Service was great, employees were friendly, and order was prompt and correct. I would try the place again now knowing what to avoid, and what to get."
5,One of my favorite places for deep dish/pizza pie. Tomato sauce is really flavorful and toppings fresh. Just the right amount of cheese - not too much or too little. No frills - can buy by the slice which is nice when you&apos;re craving deep dish but don&apos;t want an entire pie. Free parking in small lot right out front.
5,"This place has some of the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! I got the stuffed pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, spinach, tomato, and garlic. The toppings are all in the middle of the pizza rather than on top. It was definitely the thickest deep dish pizza I&apos;ve ever had. The crust was also soft but hard enough to hold up the shape of the pizza. It definitely comes close to Lou Malnatis but I&apos;m not sure it can beat it. It is almost a different type of deep dish altogether compared to Lous and I still think everyone should try it and compare for themselves!"
1,"As I&apos;ve been to the Ashland location several times, today was a disgusting surprise... I always stop by if I&apos;m in the neighborhood, given I live in Schaumburg, however, this time I was truly surprised by the low quality ingredients as the sausage was raw.... needless to say food poisoning was part of the menu today.  Fair warning to all patrons, have your pizza fully cooked ... I&apos;m disappointed with the quality the kitchen has been serving"
1,"I JUST HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE HERE. Ordered a pizza online through THEIR WEBSITE at 6pm, arrived at the restaurant at 7pm to pick up my pizza which I was told via their online tracking system was going to be ready at 7:05. One of the cashiers told me they never received the ticket on their system, they couldn&apos;t move my pizza to the front and they couldn&apos;t offer me anything (they literally didn&apos;t even offer me a free slice of pizza). My only option was to wait another 45 minutes for it to be ready. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I&apos;VE EXPERIENCED IN A WHILE. Certainly won&apos;t be trying their pizza now."
5,Tried their deep dish and it was DELICIOUS! Hands down the best stuffed I&apos;ve had and I&apos;m Chicago born and raised.
5,"Woah, first time ordering from here. I ordered The thin crust version of ART&apos;S MEATY DELIGHT pizza with extra cheese well done. 
Probably the best pizza I&apos;ve had in a long time, and the best I&apos;ve had since living in the city. LOTS of meat, they didn&apos;t skip, and when I said extra cheese I got that extra cheese. Lots of flavor, love that they weren&apos;t scared to use oregano. 

I&apos;ll definitely order again, may try the stuffed version next time."
2,"Could have been much better, they rely on more cheese for the rating. Very Avg taste"
5,"First time trying this place and we were completely satisfied. We ordered the pan and it was more like a deep dish (which was completely fine with us!). Unlike other pizza places, Art of Pizza loaded our pizza with toppings and lots of cheese (it reflected in the price). Will definitely order again!"
5,"Came here with my husband after he raved about Chicago style pizza for years! This is his fav pizza place in all of Chicago area, and it did not disappoint. We got the Art&apos;s Special (and entire pizza for dine in), and holy cow it was delicious. Staff was super friendly and happy to hear how much we love the place. 100% recommend you visit this location, can&apos;t vouch for the other location on State St (under different ownership). Also pizza by the slice. YUMMMM"
3,"Ordered delivery here a couple weekends ago.  The pizza was solid but unexceptional. Pizza and crust could have used some flavor. 

The sandwich we ordered was good - toppings, especially the meat, were good. 

Overall, pretty average, so we were a bit let down given the high reviews and good recommendations."
1,"Don&apos;t bother. 
Mediocre food, which is ok since their prices are cheap.
But the employees don&apos;t care and they give THE WORST service. 

Wherever you live, wherever you are, I guarantee there are at least a few italian restaurants around. Order from there, I promise the food will be at least as good, and the service has to be better.

Gads"
4,"Ordered delivery on a chilly night in. I&apos;ve had Art of Pizza multiple times in the past and was a big fan. This time I felt that there was a lot of cheese and not enough toppings or sauce. We ordered 12 inch stuffed pizza with gardinera and spinach - either there wasn&apos;t enough toppings or too much cheese to really taste them. The 12 in was way too much for a group of three, but deep dish leftovers are something I always look forward to!

Hoping next time we have a better experience! 

FYI great if you want deep dish by the slice! This is the only place I know that does this"
4,"Ordered delivery (speedy!) from here last weekend with my husband. We received a 14 inch thin crust with mushrooms, onion, pepper, and sausage (enough for 4 people!). It was very tasty but we both wished there was more sauce. The cheese to sauce ratio was a bit off. However, we will absolutely order from them again and try the infamous deep dish pizza!!"
4,"First time trying and hearing about this place. My friend ordered a delivery of the southwestern pizza with pineapple and mushroom I think. We also got a side of fried mushrooms and fried jalape√±o poppers. Pizza was absolutely flavorful and delicious! It was extremely cheesy and the ratio of crust to filling+toppings and sauce was perfect! I&apos;d definitely try more of their pizzas. Their sides were good too but nothing extraordinary. Overall, great place for pizza!"
4,"Coming from someone who prefers NY style over Chicago, I am impressed. Over the years, I&apos;ve given various Chicago places and styles tries and they all have their pros and cons. I definitely don&apos;t dig the thin crust anywhere, so I got the pan pizza in this instance. The dough is really tasty and the sauce is outstanding. Better than a lot of other places, to my memory. Still a lot of dough to my general liking, but I enjoyed it.

What knocked it out of the park for me was the meatball sub. The sub only comes with two enormous balls (I&apos;d prefer them a little more bite size, so they can fit in my mouth) but nevertheless they were juicy and full of flavor. 

Should I order from these guys again (and I plan to) I reckon that a stuffed will yield similar results, as well as the other sandwiches. With the meatball sub the main crux of my meal, I only had one slice of the pan... so I look forward to future snacks and meals with the bounty of leftover."
1,The last two times I ordered from here the toppings were bland and skimpy. Nothing had much taste other than seasoning that was shook  onto the top of the pizza. Won&apos;t be ordering again.
5,"Again Awesome stuffed pizza. Wow!! We had the arts special which is loaded with tons of cheese, peppers, onions, mushrooms and sausage covered with fresh Mariana sauce that is incredible. We got a whole pie and it was half eaten by the time we got home. 

Regarding customer service. I&apos;ve had no problems when the person takes my over the phone order. I walk in, pay, get my food and leave, please and thank you. Haven&apos;t met any rudeness that others have mentioned"
3,"I really wanted to like them more overall since so many reviews spoke highly of them! We called in an order on a week night for 9pm since it was one of the few spots that were opened late. When I spoke to the man on the phone, his tone was brass and harsh as I ordered for a beef and sausage sandwich combo since it was the special that night. And he yells on the phone &quot;wait huh, you wanted a what!?&quot; He came off as wanting to rush me placing my order which was a little frustrating. I also ordered the meaty delight thin sliced pizza in 14 inch. We went to pick up the pizza and the guy at the front desk told us we had to wait for our food since it wasn&apos;t ready. When he told us it was finally ready, he gave us a completely wrong pizza order that was under the same name. Turns out our food had been ready all long. The food was overall fine, I didn&apos;t honestly find anything super special about the sandwich and pizza. The meaty delight pizza had your meats of bacon, ground beef, pepperoni, sliced beef, and sausage. I maybe would like to come back to try some of the highly recommended dishes some other time to give it another shot."
2,"I have been so excited to try this place as I have heard such great things about both their deep dish as well as their regular pizza. Ordered pickup and wanted to try one of each style since people have raved about both! Got a meaty deep dish and sausage, onion, and green pepper regular style. I really wanted to love it but I was let down as both pizzas overall were very dry. There was very little sauce on both pizzas making both of them very underwhelming. Overall, both pizza were very dry and bland - but it was filling. Total $46."

My only option was to wait another 45 minutes for it to be ready. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I&apos;VE EXPERIENCED IN A WHILE. Certainly won&apos;t be trying their pizza now."
5,Tried their deep dish and it was DELICIOUS! Hands down the best stuffed I&apos;ve had and I&apos;m Chicago born and raised.
5,"Woah, first time ordering from here. I ordered The thin crust version of ART&apos;S MEATY DELIGHT pizza with extra cheese well done. 
Probably the best pizza I&apos;ve had in a long time, and the best I&apos;ve had since living in the city. LOTS of meat, they didn&apos;t skip, and when I said extra cheese I got that extra cheese. Lots of flavor, love that they weren&apos;t scared to use oregano. 

I&apos;ll definitely order again, may try the stuffed version next time."
2,"Could have been much better, they rely on more cheese for the rating. Very Avg taste"
5,"First time trying this place and we were completely satisfied. We ordered the pan and it was more like a deep dish (which was completely fine with us!). Unlike other pizza places, Art of Pizza loaded our pizza with toppings and lots of cheese (it reflected in the price). Will definitely order again!"
5,"Came here with my husband after he raved about Chicago style pizza for years! This is his fav pizza place in all of Chicago area, and it did not disappoint. We got the Art&apos;s Special (and entire pizza for dine in), and holy cow it was delicious. Staff was super friendly and happy to hear how much we love the place. 100% recommend you visit this location, can&apos;t vouch for the other location on State St (under different ownership). Also pizza by the slice. YUMMMM"
3,"Ordered delivery here a couple weekends ago.  The pizza was solid but unexceptional. Pizza and crust could have used some flavor. 

The sandwich we ordered was good - toppings, especially the meat, were good. 

Overall, pretty average, so we were a bit let down given the high reviews and good recommendations."
1,"Don&apos;t bother. 
Mediocre food, which is ok since their prices are cheap.
But the employees don&apos;t care and they give THE WORST service. 

Wherever you live, wherever you are, I guarantee there are at least a few italian restaurants around. Order from there, I promise the food will be at least as good, and the service has to be better.

Gads"
4,"Ordered delivery on a chilly night in. I&apos;ve had Art of Pizza multiple times in the past and was a big fan. This time I felt that there was a lot of cheese and not enough toppings or sauce. We ordered 12 inch stuffed pizza with gardinera and spinach - either there wasn&apos;t enough toppings or too much cheese to really taste them. The 12 in was way too much for a group of three, but deep dish leftovers are something I always look forward to!

Hoping next time we have a better experience! 

FYI great if you want deep dish by the slice! This is the only place I know that does this"
4,"Ordered delivery (speedy!) from here last weekend with my husband. We received a 14 inch thin crust with mushrooms, onion, pepper, and sausage (enough for 4 people!). It was very tasty but we both wished there was more sauce. The cheese to sauce ratio was a bit off. However, we will absolutely order from them again and try the infamous deep dish pizza!!"
4,"First time trying and hearing about this place. My friend ordered a delivery of the southwestern pizza with pineapple and mushroom I think. We also got a side of fried mushrooms and fried jalape√±o poppers. Pizza was absolutely flavorful and delicious! It was extremely cheesy and the ratio of crust to filling+toppings and sauce was perfect! I&apos;d definitely try more of their pizzas. Their sides were good too but nothing extraordinary. Overall, great place for pizza!"
4,"Coming from someone who prefers NY style over Chicago, I am impressed. Over the years, I&apos;ve given various Chicago places and styles tries and they all have their pros and cons. I definitely don&apos;t dig the thin crust anywhere, so I got the pan pizza in this instance. The dough is really tasty and the sauce is outstanding. Better than a lot of other places, to my memory. Still a lot of dough to my general liking, but I enjoyed it.

What knocked it out of the park for me was the meatball sub. The sub only comes with two enormous balls (I&apos;d prefer them a little more bite size, so they can fit in my mouth) but nevertheless they were juicy and full of flavor. 

Should I order from these guys again (and I plan to) I reckon that a stuffed will yield similar results, as well as the other sandwiches. With the meatball sub the main crux of my meal, I only had one slice of the pan... so I look forward to future snacks and meals with the bounty of leftover."
1,The last two times I ordered from here the toppings were bland and skimpy. Nothing had much taste other than seasoning that was shook  onto the top of the pizza. Won&apos;t be ordering again.
5,"Again Awesome stuffed pizza. Wow!! We had the arts special which is loaded with tons of cheese, peppers, onions, mushrooms and sausage covered with fresh Mariana sauce that is incredible. We got a whole pie and it was half eaten by the time we got home. 

Regarding customer service. I&apos;ve had no problems when the person takes my over the phone order. I walk in, pay, get my food and leave, please and thank you. Haven&apos;t met any rudeness that others have mentioned"
3,"I really wanted to like them more overall since so many reviews spoke highly of them! We called in an order on a week night for 9pm since it was one of the few spots that were opened late. When I spoke to the man on the phone, his tone was brass and harsh as I ordered for a beef and sausage sandwich combo since it was the special that night. And he yells on the phone &quot;wait huh, you wanted a what!?&quot; He came off as wanting to rush me placing my order which was a little frustrating. I also ordered the meaty delight thin sliced pizza in 14 inch. We went to pick up the pizza and the guy at the front desk told us we had to wait for our food since it wasn&apos;t ready. When he told us it was finally ready, he gave us a completely wrong pizza order that was under the same name. Turns out our food had been ready all long. The food was overall fine, I didn&apos;t honestly find anything super special about the sandwich and pizza. The meaty delight pizza had your meats of bacon, ground beef, pepperoni, sliced beef, and sausage. I maybe would like to come back to try some of the highly recommended dishes some other time to give it another shot."
2,"I have been so excited to try this place as I have heard such great things about both their deep dish as well as their regular pizza. Ordered pickup and wanted to try one of each style since people have raved about both! Got a meaty deep dish and sausage, onion, and green pepper regular style. I really wanted to love it but I was let down as both pizzas overall were very dry. There was very little sauce on both pizzas making both of them very underwhelming. Overall, both pizza were very dry and bland - but it was filling. Total $46."
3,"I had super high hopes for this place given what I&apos;ve read and heard from the internet and friends. I went with a couple buddies of mine last Sunday to pick up food to eat while watching football. We ordered two pizzas (both deep dish) one pepperoni, and one of their signature topping combo. We got an Italian beef combo, and my friend ordered a basket of wings and fries.

The beef was pretty good, probably on par with a Portillos or so, the pizzas were nothing special. I love a good thick crust/deep dish pie, but these were so thick that the dough was 70% of the pizza, and it was not thoroughly cooked. The fries were soggy and pedestrian.

The real issue with this otherwise pretty good pizza shop were the wings. Holy hell, literally just don&apos;t put wings on the menu if this is your offering. They only have BBQ wings as an option as opposed to buffalo, which if they&apos;re good, that&apos;s fine, but these wings were glorified frozen chicken wings covered in ketchup. Borderline inedible.

Service was great, employees were friendly, and order was prompt and correct. I would try the place again now knowing what to avoid, and what to get."
5,One of my favorite places for deep dish/pizza pie. Tomato sauce is really flavorful and toppings fresh. Just the right amount of cheese - not too much or too little. No frills - can buy by the slice which is nice when you&apos;re craving deep dish but don&apos;t want an entire pie. Free parking in small lot right out front.
5,"This place has some of the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! I got the stuffed pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, spinach, tomato, and garlic. The toppings are all in the middle of the pizza rather than on top. It was definitely the thickest deep dish pizza I&apos;ve ever had. The crust was also soft but hard enough to hold up the shape of the pizza. It definitely comes close to Lou Malnatis but I&apos;m not sure it can beat it. It is almost a different type of deep dish altogether compared to Lous and I still think everyone should try it and compare for themselves!"
1,"As I&apos;ve been to the Ashland location several times, today was a disgusting surprise... I always stop by if I&apos;m in the neighborhood, given I live in Schaumburg, however, this time I was truly surprised by the low quality ingredients as the sausage was raw.... needless to say food poisoning was part of the menu today.  Fair warning to all patrons, have your pizza fully cooked ... I&apos;m disappointed with the quality the kitchen has been serving"

4,"Ordered delivery on a chilly night in. I&apos;ve had Art of Pizza multiple times in the past and was a big fan. This time I felt that there was a lot of cheese and not enough toppings or sauce. We ordered 12 inch stuffed pizza with gardinera and spinach - either there wasn&apos;t enough toppings or too much cheese to really taste them. The 12 in was way too much for a group of three, but deep dish leftovers are something I always look forward to!

Hoping next time we have a better experience! 

FYI great if you want deep dish by the slice! This is the only place I know that does this"
4,"Ordered delivery (speedy!) from here last weekend with my husband. We received a 14 inch thin crust with mushrooms, onion, pepper, and sausage (enough for 4 people!). It was very tasty but we both wished there was more sauce. The cheese to sauce ratio was a bit off. However, we will absolutely order from them again and try the infamous deep dish pizza!!"
4,"First time trying and hearing about this place. My friend ordered a delivery of the southwestern pizza with pineapple and mushroom I think. We also got a side of fried mushrooms and fried jalape√±o poppers. Pizza was absolutely flavorful and delicious! It was extremely cheesy and the ratio of crust to filling+toppings and sauce was perfect! I&apos;d definitely try more of their pizzas. Their sides were good too but nothing extraordinary. Overall, great place for pizza!"
4,"Coming from someone who prefers NY style over Chicago, I am impressed. Over the years, I&apos;ve given various Chicago places and styles tries and they all have their pros and cons. I definitely don&apos;t dig the thin crust anywhere, so I got the pan pizza in this instance. The dough is really tasty and the sauce is outstanding. Better than a lot of other places, to my memory. Still a lot of dough to my general liking, but I enjoyed it.

What knocked it out of the park for me was the meatball sub. The sub only comes with two enormous balls (I&apos;d prefer them a little more bite size, so they can fit in my mouth) but nevertheless they were juicy and full of flavor. 

Should I order from these guys again (and I plan to) I reckon that a stuffed will yield similar results, as well as the other sandwiches. With the meatball sub the main crux of my meal, I only had one slice of the pan... so I look forward to future snacks and meals with the bounty of leftover."
1,The last two times I ordered from here the toppings were bland and skimpy. Nothing had much taste other than seasoning that was shook  onto the top of the pizza. Won&apos;t be ordering again.
5,"Again Awesome stuffed pizza. Wow!! We had the arts special which is loaded with tons of cheese, peppers, onions, mushrooms and sausage covered with fresh Mariana sauce that is incredible. We got a whole pie and it was half eaten by the time we got home. 

Regarding customer service. I&apos;ve had no problems when the person takes my over the phone order. I walk in, pay, get my food and leave, please and thank you. Haven&apos;t met any rudeness that others have mentioned"
3,"I really wanted to like them more overall since so many reviews spoke highly of them! We called in an order on a week night for 9pm since it was one of the few spots that were opened late. When I spoke to the man on the phone, his tone was brass and harsh as I ordered for a beef and sausage sandwich combo since it was the special that night. And he yells on the phone &quot;wait huh, you wanted a what!?&quot; He came off as wanting to rush me placing my order which was a little frustrating. I also ordered the meaty delight thin sliced pizza in 14 inch. We went to pick up the pizza and the guy at the front desk told us we had to wait for our food since it wasn&apos;t ready. When he told us it was finally ready, he gave us a completely wrong pizza order that was under the same name. Turns out our food had been ready all long. The food was overall fine, I didn&apos;t honestly find anything super special about the sandwich and pizza. The meaty delight pizza had your meats of bacon, ground beef, pepperoni, sliced beef, and sausage. I maybe would like to come back to try some of the highly recommended dishes some other time to give it another shot."
2,"I have been so excited to try this place as I have heard such great things about both their deep dish as well as their regular pizza. Ordered pickup and wanted to try one of each style since people have raved about both! Got a meaty deep dish and sausage, onion, and green pepper regular style. I really wanted to love it but I was let down as both pizzas overall were very dry. There was very little sauce on both pizzas making both of them very underwhelming. Overall, both pizza were very dry and bland - but it was filling. Total $46."
3,"I had super high hopes for this place given what I&apos;ve read and heard from the internet and friends. I went with a couple buddies of mine last Sunday to pick up food to eat while watching football. We ordered two pizzas (both deep dish) one pepperoni, and one of their signature topping combo. We got an Italian beef combo, and my friend ordered a basket of wings and fries.

The beef was pretty good, probably on par with a Portillos or so, the pizzas were nothing special. I love a good thick crust/deep dish pie, but these were so thick that the dough was 70% of the pizza, and it was not thoroughly cooked. The fries were soggy and pedestrian.

The real issue with this otherwise pretty good pizza shop were the wings. Holy hell, literally just don&apos;t put wings on the menu if this is your offering. They only have BBQ wings as an option as opposed to buffalo, which if they&apos;re good, that&apos;s fine, but these wings were glorified frozen chicken wings covered in ketchup. Borderline inedible.

Service was great, employees were friendly, and order was prompt and correct. I would try the place again now knowing what to avoid, and what to get."
5,One of my favorite places for deep dish/pizza pie. Tomato sauce is really flavorful and toppings fresh. Just the right amount of cheese - not too much or too little. No frills - can buy by the slice which is nice when you&apos;re craving deep dish but don&apos;t want an entire pie. Free parking in small lot right out front.
5,"This place has some of the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! I got the stuffed pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, spinach, tomato, and garlic. The toppings are all in the middle of the pizza rather than on top. It was definitely the thickest deep dish pizza I&apos;ve ever had. The crust was also soft but hard enough to hold up the shape of the pizza. It definitely comes close to Lou Malnatis but I&apos;m not sure it can beat it. It is almost a different type of deep dish altogether compared to Lous and I still think everyone should try it and compare for themselves!"
1,"As I&apos;ve been to the Ashland location several times, today was a disgusting surprise... I always stop by if I&apos;m in the neighborhood, given I live in Schaumburg, however, this time I was truly surprised by the low quality ingredients as the sausage was raw.... needless to say food poisoning was part of the menu today.  Fair warning to all patrons, have your pizza fully cooked ... I&apos;m disappointed with the quality the kitchen has been serving"
1,"I JUST HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE HERE. Ordered a pizza online through THEIR WEBSITE at 6pm, arrived at the restaurant at 7pm to pick up my pizza which I was told via their online tracking system was going to be ready at 7:05. One of the cashiers told me they never received the ticket on their system, they couldn&apos;t move my pizza to the front and they couldn&apos;t offer me anything (they literally didn&apos;t even offer me a free slice of pizza). My only option was to wait another 45 minutes for it to be ready. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I&apos;VE EXPERIENCED IN A WHILE. Certainly won&apos;t be trying their pizza now."
5,Tried their deep dish and it was DELICIOUS! Hands down the best stuffed I&apos;ve had and I&apos;m Chicago born and raised.
5,"Woah, first time ordering from here. I ordered The thin crust version of ART&apos;S MEATY DELIGHT pizza with extra cheese well done. 
Probably the best pizza I&apos;ve had in a long time, and the best I&apos;ve had since living in the city. LOTS of meat, they didn&apos;t skip, and when I said extra cheese I got that extra cheese. Lots of flavor, love that they weren&apos;t scared to use oregano. 

I&apos;ll definitely order again, may try the stuffed version next time."
2,"Could have been much better, they rely on more cheese for the rating. Very Avg taste"
5,"First time trying this place and we were completely satisfied. We ordered the pan and it was more like a deep dish (which was completely fine with us!). Unlike other pizza places, Art of Pizza loaded our pizza with toppings and lots of cheese (it reflected in the price). Will definitely order again!"
5,"Came here with my husband after he raved about Chicago style pizza for years! This is his fav pizza place in all of Chicago area, and it did not disappoint. We got the Art&apos;s Special (and entire pizza for dine in), and holy cow it was delicious. Staff was super friendly and happy to hear how much we love the place. 100% recommend you visit this location, can&apos;t vouch for the other location on State St (under different ownership). Also pizza by the slice. YUMMMM"
3,"Ordered delivery here a couple weekends ago.  The pizza was solid but unexceptional. Pizza and crust could have used some flavor. 

The sandwich we ordered was good - toppings, especially the meat, were good. 

Overall, pretty average, so we were a bit let down given the high reviews and good recommendations."

5,"Again Awesome stuffed pizza. Wow!! We had the arts special which is loaded with tons of cheese, peppers, onions, mushrooms and sausage covered with fresh Mariana sauce that is incredible. We got a whole pie and it was half eaten by the time we got home. 

Regarding customer service. I&apos;ve had no problems when the person takes my over the phone order. I walk in, pay, get my food and leave, please and thank you. Haven&apos;t met any rudeness that others have mentioned"
3,"I really wanted to like them more overall since so many reviews spoke highly of them! We called in an order on a week night for 9pm since it was one of the few spots that were opened late. When I spoke to the man on the phone, his tone was brass and harsh as I ordered for a beef and sausage sandwich combo since it was the special that night. And he yells on the phone &quot;wait huh, you wanted a what!?&quot; He came off as wanting to rush me placing my order which was a little frustrating. I also ordered the meaty delight thin sliced pizza in 14 inch. We went to pick up the pizza and the guy at the front desk told us we had to wait for our food since it wasn&apos;t ready. When he told us it was finally ready, he gave us a completely wrong pizza order that was under the same name. Turns out our food had been ready all long. The food was overall fine, I didn&apos;t honestly find anything super special about the sandwich and pizza. The meaty delight pizza had your meats of bacon, ground beef, pepperoni, sliced beef, and sausage. I maybe would like to come back to try some of the highly recommended dishes some other time to give it another shot."
2,"I have been so excited to try this place as I have heard such great things about both their deep dish as well as their regular pizza. Ordered pickup and wanted to try one of each style since people have raved about both! Got a meaty deep dish and sausage, onion, and green pepper regular style. I really wanted to love it but I was let down as both pizzas overall were very dry. There was very little sauce on both pizzas making both of them very underwhelming. Overall, both pizza were very dry and bland - but it was filling. Total $46."
3,"I had super high hopes for this place given what I&apos;ve read and heard from the internet and friends. I went with a couple buddies of mine last Sunday to pick up food to eat while watching football. We ordered two pizzas (both deep dish) one pepperoni, and one of their signature topping combo. We got an Italian beef combo, and my friend ordered a basket of wings and fries.

The beef was pretty good, probably on par with a Portillos or so, the pizzas were nothing special. I love a good thick crust/deep dish pie, but these were so thick that the dough was 70% of the pizza, and it was not thoroughly cooked. The fries were soggy and pedestrian.

The real issue with this otherwise pretty good pizza shop were the wings. Holy hell, literally just don&apos;t put wings on the menu if this is your offering. They only have BBQ wings as an option as opposed to buffalo, which if they&apos;re good, that&apos;s fine, but these wings were glorified frozen chicken wings covered in ketchup. Borderline inedible.

Service was great, employees were friendly, and order was prompt and correct. I would try the place again now knowing what to avoid, and what to get."
5,One of my favorite places for deep dish/pizza pie. Tomato sauce is really flavorful and toppings fresh. Just the right amount of cheese - not too much or too little. No frills - can buy by the slice which is nice when you&apos;re craving deep dish but don&apos;t want an entire pie. Free parking in small lot right out front.
5,"This place has some of the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! I got the stuffed pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, spinach, tomato, and garlic. The toppings are all in the middle of the pizza rather than on top. It was definitely the thickest deep dish pizza I&apos;ve ever had. The crust was also soft but hard enough to hold up the shape of the pizza. It definitely comes close to Lou Malnatis but I&apos;m not sure it can beat it. It is almost a different type of deep dish altogether compared to Lous and I still think everyone should try it and compare for themselves!"
1,"As I&apos;ve been to the Ashland location several times, today was a disgusting surprise... I always stop by if I&apos;m in the neighborhood, given I live in Schaumburg, however, this time I was truly surprised by the low quality ingredients as the sausage was raw.... needless to say food poisoning was part of the menu today.  Fair warning to all patrons, have your pizza fully cooked ... I&apos;m disappointed with the quality the kitchen has been serving"
1,"I JUST HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE HERE. Ordered a pizza online through THEIR WEBSITE at 6pm, arrived at the restaurant at 7pm to pick up my pizza which I was told via their online tracking system was going to be ready at 7:05. One of the cashiers told me they never received the ticket on their system, they couldn&apos;t move my pizza to the front and they couldn&apos;t offer me anything (they literally didn&apos;t even offer me a free slice of pizza). My only option was to wait another 45 minutes for it to be ready. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I&apos;VE EXPERIENCED IN A WHILE. Certainly won&apos;t be trying their pizza now."
5,Tried their deep dish and it was DELICIOUS! Hands down the best stuffed I&apos;ve had and I&apos;m Chicago born and raised.
5,"Woah, first time ordering from here. I ordered The thin crust version of ART&apos;S MEATY DELIGHT pizza with extra cheese well done. 
Probably the best pizza I&apos;ve had in a long time, and the best I&apos;ve had since living in the city. LOTS of meat, they didn&apos;t skip, and when I said extra cheese I got that extra cheese. Lots of flavor, love that they weren&apos;t scared to use oregano. 

I&apos;ll definitely order again, may try the stuffed version next time."
2,"Could have been much better, they rely on more cheese for the rating. Very Avg taste"
5,"First time trying this place and we were completely satisfied. We ordered the pan and it was more like a deep dish (which was completely fine with us!). Unlike other pizza places, Art of Pizza loaded our pizza with toppings and lots of cheese (it reflected in the price). Will definitely order again!"
5,"Came here with my husband after he raved about Chicago style pizza for years! This is his fav pizza place in all of Chicago area, and it did not disappoint. We got the Art&apos;s Special (and entire pizza for dine in), and holy cow it was delicious. Staff was super friendly and happy to hear how much we love the place. 100% recommend you visit this location, can&apos;t vouch for the other location on State St (under different ownership). Also pizza by the slice. YUMMMM"
3,"Ordered delivery here a couple weekends ago.  The pizza was solid but unexceptional. Pizza and crust could have used some flavor. 

The sandwich we ordered was good - toppings, especially the meat, were good. 

Overall, pretty average, so we were a bit let down given the high reviews and good recommendations."
1,"Don&apos;t bother. 
Mediocre food, which is ok since their prices are cheap.
But the employees don&apos;t care and they give THE WORST service. 

Wherever you live, wherever you are, I guarantee there are at least a few italian restaurants around. Order from there, I promise the food will be at least as good, and the service has to be better.

Gads"
4,"Ordered delivery on a chilly night in. I&apos;ve had Art of Pizza multiple times in the past and was a big fan. This time I felt that there was a lot of cheese and not enough toppings or sauce. We ordered 12 inch stuffed pizza with gardinera and spinach - either there wasn&apos;t enough toppings or too much cheese to really taste them. The 12 in was way too much for a group of three, but deep dish leftovers are something I always look forward to!

Hoping next time we have a better experience! 

FYI great if you want deep dish by the slice! This is the only place I know that does this"
4,"Ordered delivery (speedy!) from here last weekend with my husband. We received a 14 inch thin crust with mushrooms, onion, pepper, and sausage (enough for 4 people!). It was very tasty but we both wished there was more sauce. The cheese to sauce ratio was a bit off. However, we will absolutely order from them again and try the infamous deep dish pizza!!"
4,"First time trying and hearing about this place. My friend ordered a delivery of the southwestern pizza with pineapple and mushroom I think. We also got a side of fried mushrooms and fried jalape√±o poppers. Pizza was absolutely flavorful and delicious! It was extremely cheesy and the ratio of crust to filling+toppings and sauce was perfect! I&apos;d definitely try more of their pizzas. Their sides were good too but nothing extraordinary. Overall, great place for pizza!"
4,"Coming from someone who prefers NY style over Chicago, I am impressed. Over the years, I&apos;ve given various Chicago places and styles tries and they all have their pros and cons. I definitely don&apos;t dig the thin crust anywhere, so I got the pan pizza in this instance. The dough is really tasty and the sauce is outstanding. Better than a lot of other places, to my memory. Still a lot of dough to my general liking, but I enjoyed it.

What knocked it out of the park for me was the meatball sub. The sub only comes with two enormous balls (I&apos;d prefer them a little more bite size, so they can fit in my mouth) but nevertheless they were juicy and full of flavor. 

Should I order from these guys again (and I plan to) I reckon that a stuffed will yield similar results, as well as the other sandwiches. With the meatball sub the main crux of my meal, I only had one slice of the pan... so I look forward to future snacks and meals with the bounty of leftover."
