5,"The reviews are true about the conchiglie alla sarda. It&apos;s frickin&apos; amazing, you guys. It&apos;s seashell past in a tomato cream sauce with italian sausage, peas and pecorino cheese and its absolutely TO DIE FOR. 

We ordered takeout from here a couple weeks ago and it knocked our socks off. Everything was fresh, great portions for the price still hot after we got home after picking it up. They&apos;re also open for indoor dining (they have a big door/windows I believe, so they meet the city&apos;s requirements). 1000% will be back 12/10 would recommend the conchiglie alla sarda. Can&apos;t miss dish!"
5,"Here&apos;s why Topo Gigio gets five stars in my book:
- The FOOD. Topo Gigio&apos;s cuisine is like a portal to Italy. The first bite of your appetizer transports you to your own private table in a villa in Capri. Then the aroma of your entree takes you on a gondola ride on the Grand Canal in Venice and what&apos;s that over there .. you&apos;re watching the sunset in Bologna where the shifting sun adds lifts in the red hues bathing the city in a golden light. Yes, the food is that good. My friend, who is one of the pickiest eaters I have ever met constantly asks me to meet her for lunch or dinner here so that says a lot. 

Here are my favorite items from the menu:
Appetizer - Calamari alla Griglia (Grilled Calamari in a Wine and Lemon Sauce.)
Entree - Conchiglie alla Sarda (Sea Shell Pasta in a Tomato-Cream Sauce with Ground Sausage, Peas and Pecorino Cheese.)
Desert - hands down BEST TIRAMISU at least in Chicago. 

- Atmosphere. They have lots of regulars that frequent the restaurant that gives it a family vibe (no, not like Olive Garden family vibe, better.) How do I know this? Because you can hear the conversations with them and the staff and it is a delight. The have plenty of outdoor seating and the inside is cozy and inviting. 

- Service. Our servers have been wonderful. We also always carry on a conversation with them (hence why they have so many regulars) and they know the menu like the back of their hand. They can tell you everything about the restaurant. 

- The owner. We got to meet one of the owners, Frank, who explained to us how fresh his food is and how he makes sure to only use authentic ingredients. A lot of his ingredients is flown in from Italy. He was talking to customers at the bar and we asked our server who that was and he said &quot;the owner, wanna talk to him?&quot; We immediately said &quot;heck yeah!&quot; Our waiter called him over and Frank was so friendly and welcoming. He talked to us for a while (more than I ever thought an owner of a restaurant would) which made us feel like VIP diners. He was also a delight and told us to give him a hello whenever we see him. So nice!

This restaurant has a lot of history and is a true Chicago gem. I&apos;m so glad to see them still operating during Covid and I will continue to eat here because every time I do, it is always a great experience!"
5,"I picked up my dinner for takeout last night and was nervous it wouldn&apos;t be as good as in the restaurant, but it was still so warm and delicious! I ordered the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare and was actually shocked (in a good way) by how much seafood was in it!! I&apos;ve ordered this dish at other Italian restaurants and always feel like there&apos;s not enough seafood. I would rate the dish 4.5/5 just because I was expecting a little more flavor/spice out of the spaghetti sauce. They also gave me some bread and salad in my to-go order which I didn&apos;t realize came with it. It&apos;s the little things right? Delicious food and would love to go back and actually dine in the restaurant next time!"
4,"We were on a walking tour in the Old Town area and decided on Topo Gigio for lunch I ordered the Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs, the spaghetti, and the red sauce was good and a good portion too but I was disappointed with the meatballs, they were bland had no garlicky herbal taste at all.
My friend ordered the Fusilli Alla Topo Gigio, their Signature Pasta Dish w/Chicken. She said it was very good and enough for a second meal.

 We ordered the Tiramisu for dessert which was really good and a nice portion to boot, good for sharing. I regret not asking the busboy for a new coffee because it looked like the coffee was sitting for a while. My friend ordered a Cappuccino but oddly they didn&apos;t sprinkle cinnamon or cocoa on top so we asked the busboy about it and he said &quot;they didn&apos;t have anything to sprinkle on top&quot;. Huh?

The staff was really nice. They brought water and iced tea all the time. Nice crusty bread with dinner. The waiter didn&apos;t mention the prices of the daily specials they started at $16.95 to $21.95 until we asked."
4,"Topo Gigio is a neighborhood gem. I am not the biggest fan of Italian food, but went back to this restaurant twice!

The outdoor seating in the backyard patio type of setting has such a romantic feel to it and helps you escape from the busy streets of Chicago. Definitely recommend for a family dinner, catching up with friends or even a date with your significant other. 

Plates ordered:
Bruschetta- hard to not be good, but loved the freshness of all the ingredients 

Fusilloni Tocco Delicato- Great light and fresh vegetarian option. Would probably not order again, because would want to try other options!

Fusilli alla Topo Gigio- My favorite dish here, the creamy sauce with the perfectly cooked chicken makes me keep coming back here!"
5,Wonderful food and wonderful service... the lemon fish was absolutely perfect and the pasta was delicious... the spot is charming and the staff is so nice and inviting... will be returning soon !!!
5,The best Italian restaurant in Chicago. The perfect combo of a little upscale but still has that family feel. My husband forgot his mask in the car and a team member said &quot;We have extra masks.&quot; Perfect al dente pasta (fusilli Topo Gigio is always my go-to). Gilberto was our server and was delightful. Been going here for years and will keep going back!
2,"I didn&apos;t have a good experience here. First, the place is EXTREMELY crowded. It&apos;s like they for waaaayyy too chairs into that space so there is no sense of your own space for meal and it kind of ruins the ambience. The waiter we had was  really short with us to the point of almost being rude. 
The meals we ordered were subpar. We ordered the 
Tortellini panna and it was just under flavored. I ordered the special of the Osso  Buco risotto and same. It just needed to be flavored more and it was lacking texture. Every bite was just mushy. The meat was super tender don&apos;t get me wrong but it was missing something. It was also under salted and desperately needed spice. just seems over priced for what they are offering. The one good thing was that the bread was warm and served with oil and Parmesan cheese and that it&apos;s walkiijg so distance time second city."
1,"What a rude person on the phone. We didn&apos;t even get to go there. Whoever it was, a woman that picks up the phone to make a reservation was very unpleasant.  I guess  I will not experience this place."
5,"Like many folks, I really love Italian food, and find myself craving it often. When I do get a craving, this is the place I go. On my most recent visit I had the frisée, fennel and radicchio salad tossed in a citrus vinaigrette, and thought it was excellent; imaginative ingredients that paired perfectly with the light dressing. For my main I chose a special, a seafood and pasta dish that was very similar to their fruitti de mare, but was somewhat spicier and featured the happy addition of large shrimp, all tossed in their well balanced marinara. Too good to share. Patio seating is always a treat, and a requirement for us during these pandemic times, but I&apos;ll be ordering takeout now that the weather&apos;s turned. I guess I&apos;ll have to procure my own bottle of Chianti and enjoy it without the great service they provide. Alas. I&apos;ll most definitely be back. And back. And..."
4,"It was late for lunchtime in the Windy City, and my friend and I wanted something that would warm us up, but also not be too filling. We checked on Yelp for lunch spots nearby and when Topo Gigio popped up, she endorsed it, as she had been there before. Off we went, ready for a cozy place with some delicious food. 

We were met at the entrance by a crisply-dressed host, who led us to our table. After perusing the menu, we both decided that the Tortellini soup sounded like the perfect lunch on this brisk day. Before it arrived, we enjoyed a selection of hot and fresh bread with some olive oil to keep our hunger at bay. 

When the soup arrived, I used some of the Parmesan cheese that the server had brought out with our bread basket and added a bit to the top of the soup. Once it melted a bit, it made the perfect peppy addition to the soup -- the proverbial cherry on top, if you will. We both devoured the soup, and at the end I even told my friend &quot;I could eat a whole pot of that soup!&quot; Something about the filling tortellini, the savory component to the broth, and the extra zest of the cheese on top hit the spot on that day. 

Our servers made sure to keep our water glasses filled, and didn&apos;t seem to mind that we only got a light lunch, still giving us attention and checking in if we needed anything. If you&apos;re looking for a quick lunch spot with delicious food and great service, Topo Gigio belongs at the top of your list!"
4,"My, gahd. Who&apos;s cooking my food back there?! 

I&apos;m not a huge pasta person, but I&apos;ll be one if we&apos;re going to Topo Gigio!

The Conchiglie Alla Sarda is absolutely the best way to go. It almost tastes like a blend of white and red paste. It quite honestly could be. I&apos;m still not even sure what I ordered, haha. Don&apos;t @ me, but I think the next time I come here, I&apos;ll have to ask for my pasta to be cooked a bit more. I like them borderline soggy, lol. 

Don&apos;t forget to order the grilled calamari. So worth it! It&apos;s basically an entree-sized snack. My boyfriend and I split the two. We were absolutely stuffed. Well, it&apos;s probably because we had bread too.

Definitely a fan but wouldn&apos;t murder for Topo Gigio."
5,"We had such a good meal at Topi Gigio! We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for somewhere to eat in Old Town on a Saturday. There was a 45 minute wait, but we got in within 25 min of putting our name in. 

We sat outside under a heat lamp, and it wasn&apos;t too chilly. The atmosphere was lively as expected. The service was fantastic as well!

There were three of us - two got the fusilli topo gigio, and another the spaghetti and meatballs. We would be happy to order the same thing over and over again!! There was plenty to take home for seconds as well. We were served complimentary bread and olive oil to start our meal, fresh out of the oven.

We were very satisfied with our meals!! I can&apos;t wait to come back and bring other friends!"
5,Best Italian place you will EVER eat at. Be sure to go on a weekend and order the fettuccine special! YUM!
5,"Authentic Italian with homemade pasta al dente.  
Definitely a restaurant to go back."
5,The ambience here was amaze. I don&apos;t think you can mess up pasta but topo Gigio&apos;s was outta this world!!!!. We started with burrata and each had a different dish. They were super flexible with my friend who was gluten free
5,"This is one of our favorite Italian places in the city. We&apos;ve never dined in, but when we order takeout they give us cute little side salads and crusty bread along with our pasta entrees. The pastas are phenomenal - my favorites are the Vic Damone, Conchiglie alla Sarda, and Fusilloni. SO good, and fast easy pick up to boot."
5,Amazing!!! The food was incredible!!!! The service was great!!! I will definitely be coming back.
5,"This place was amazing. The service, the ambiance and the food!!!! I got one of the pasta dishes, shown in the photos, it&apos;s one of the specialties. It was a huge portion with more than enough to take home. The waiter was amazing and knew everything about every kind of food and bottle of wine. The place is also a lot bigger than I thought! I will definitely be back!!!"
5,"Everything absolutely delicious!!! Sauces had the right consistency and flavor. Seafood all tasted fresh. Housemade fettuccine in lobster tomato sauce with seafood was a special which a shame because it can very easily be a go-to dish for me! Tiramisu was perfect finish.

1. Calamari alla Griglia - grilled calamari sauteed with lemon and wine sauce
2. Housemade fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, and clams in lobster tomato cream sauce
3. Conchiglie alla Sarda - seashell pasta in a tomato cream sauce with ground sausage, peas
4. Tiramisu

Portions very generous. Service was good."

The one good thing was that the bread was warm and served with oil and Parmesan cheese and that it&apos;s walkiijg so distance time second city."
1,"What a rude person on the phone. We didn&apos;t even get to go there. Whoever it was, a woman that picks up the phone to make a reservation was very unpleasant.  I guess  I will not experience this place."
5,"Like many folks, I really love Italian food, and find myself craving it often. When I do get a craving, this is the place I go. On my most recent visit I had the frisée, fennel and radicchio salad tossed in a citrus vinaigrette, and thought it was excellent; imaginative ingredients that paired perfectly with the light dressing. For my main I chose a special, a seafood and pasta dish that was very similar to their fruitti de mare, but was somewhat spicier and featured the happy addition of large shrimp, all tossed in their well balanced marinara. Too good to share. Patio seating is always a treat, and a requirement for us during these pandemic times, but I&apos;ll be ordering takeout now that the weather&apos;s turned. I guess I&apos;ll have to procure my own bottle of Chianti and enjoy it without the great service they provide. Alas. I&apos;ll most definitely be back. And back. And..."
4,"It was late for lunchtime in the Windy City, and my friend and I wanted something that would warm us up, but also not be too filling. We checked on Yelp for lunch spots nearby and when Topo Gigio popped up, she endorsed it, as she had been there before. Off we went, ready for a cozy place with some delicious food. 

We were met at the entrance by a crisply-dressed host, who led us to our table. After perusing the menu, we both decided that the Tortellini soup sounded like the perfect lunch on this brisk day. Before it arrived, we enjoyed a selection of hot and fresh bread with some olive oil to keep our hunger at bay. 

When the soup arrived, I used some of the Parmesan cheese that the server had brought out with our bread basket and added a bit to the top of the soup. Once it melted a bit, it made the perfect peppy addition to the soup -- the proverbial cherry on top, if you will. We both devoured the soup, and at the end I even told my friend &quot;I could eat a whole pot of that soup!&quot; Something about the filling tortellini, the savory component to the broth, and the extra zest of the cheese on top hit the spot on that day. 

Our servers made sure to keep our water glasses filled, and didn&apos;t seem to mind that we only got a light lunch, still giving us attention and checking in if we needed anything. If you&apos;re looking for a quick lunch spot with delicious food and great service, Topo Gigio belongs at the top of your list!"
4,"My, gahd. Who&apos;s cooking my food back there?! 

I&apos;m not a huge pasta person, but I&apos;ll be one if we&apos;re going to Topo Gigio!

The Conchiglie Alla Sarda is absolutely the best way to go. It almost tastes like a blend of white and red paste. It quite honestly could be. I&apos;m still not even sure what I ordered, haha. Don&apos;t @ me, but I think the next time I come here, I&apos;ll have to ask for my pasta to be cooked a bit more. I like them borderline soggy, lol. 

Don&apos;t forget to order the grilled calamari. So worth it! It&apos;s basically an entree-sized snack. My boyfriend and I split the two. We were absolutely stuffed. Well, it&apos;s probably because we had bread too.

Definitely a fan but wouldn&apos;t murder for Topo Gigio."
5,"We had such a good meal at Topi Gigio! We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for somewhere to eat in Old Town on a Saturday. There was a 45 minute wait, but we got in within 25 min of putting our name in. 

We sat outside under a heat lamp, and it wasn&apos;t too chilly. The atmosphere was lively as expected. The service was fantastic as well!

There were three of us - two got the fusilli topo gigio, and another the spaghetti and meatballs. We would be happy to order the same thing over and over again!! There was plenty to take home for seconds as well. We were served complimentary bread and olive oil to start our meal, fresh out of the oven.

We were very satisfied with our meals!! I can&apos;t wait to come back and bring other friends!"
5,Best Italian place you will EVER eat at. Be sure to go on a weekend and order the fettuccine special! YUM!
5,"Authentic Italian with homemade pasta al dente.  
Definitely a restaurant to go back."
5,The ambience here was amaze. I don&apos;t think you can mess up pasta but topo Gigio&apos;s was outta this world!!!!. We started with burrata and each had a different dish. They were super flexible with my friend who was gluten free
5,"This is one of our favorite Italian places in the city. We&apos;ve never dined in, but when we order takeout they give us cute little side salads and crusty bread along with our pasta entrees. The pastas are phenomenal - my favorites are the Vic Damone, Conchiglie alla Sarda, and Fusilloni. SO good, and fast easy pick up to boot."
5,Amazing!!! The food was incredible!!!! The service was great!!! I will definitely be coming back.
5,"This place was amazing. The service, the ambiance and the food!!!! I got one of the pasta dishes, shown in the photos, it&apos;s one of the specialties. It was a huge portion with more than enough to take home. The waiter was amazing and knew everything about every kind of food and bottle of wine. The place is also a lot bigger than I thought! I will definitely be back!!!"
5,"Everything absolutely delicious!!! Sauces had the right consistency and flavor. Seafood all tasted fresh. Housemade fettuccine in lobster tomato sauce with seafood was a special which a shame because it can very easily be a go-to dish for me! Tiramisu was perfect finish.

1. Calamari alla Griglia - grilled calamari sauteed with lemon and wine sauce
2. Housemade fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, and clams in lobster tomato cream sauce
3. Conchiglie alla Sarda - seashell pasta in a tomato cream sauce with ground sausage, peas
4. Tiramisu

Portions very generous. Service was good."
5,"The reviews are true about the conchiglie alla sarda. It&apos;s frickin&apos; amazing, you guys. It&apos;s seashell past in a tomato cream sauce with italian sausage, peas and pecorino cheese and its absolutely TO DIE FOR. 

We ordered takeout from here a couple weeks ago and it knocked our socks off. Everything was fresh, great portions for the price still hot after we got home after picking it up. They&apos;re also open for indoor dining (they have a big door/windows I believe, so they meet the city&apos;s requirements). 1000% will be back 12/10 would recommend the conchiglie alla sarda. Can&apos;t miss dish!"
5,"Here&apos;s why Topo Gigio gets five stars in my book:
- The FOOD. Topo Gigio&apos;s cuisine is like a portal to Italy. The first bite of your appetizer transports you to your own private table in a villa in Capri. Then the aroma of your entree takes you on a gondola ride on the Grand Canal in Venice and what&apos;s that over there .. you&apos;re watching the sunset in Bologna where the shifting sun adds lifts in the red hues bathing the city in a golden light. Yes, the food is that good. My friend, who is one of the pickiest eaters I have ever met constantly asks me to meet her for lunch or dinner here so that says a lot. 

Here are my favorite items from the menu:
Appetizer - Calamari alla Griglia (Grilled Calamari in a Wine and Lemon Sauce.)
Entree - Conchiglie alla Sarda (Sea Shell Pasta in a Tomato-Cream Sauce with Ground Sausage, Peas and Pecorino Cheese.)
Desert - hands down BEST TIRAMISU at least in Chicago. 

- Atmosphere. They have lots of regulars that frequent the restaurant that gives it a family vibe (no, not like Olive Garden family vibe, better.) How do I know this? Because you can hear the conversations with them and the staff and it is a delight. The have plenty of outdoor seating and the inside is cozy and inviting. 

- Service. Our servers have been wonderful. We also always carry on a conversation with them (hence why they have so many regulars) and they know the menu like the back of their hand. They can tell you everything about the restaurant. 

- The owner. We got to meet one of the owners, Frank, who explained to us how fresh his food is and how he makes sure to only use authentic ingredients. A lot of his ingredients is flown in from Italy. He was talking to customers at the bar and we asked our server who that was and he said &quot;the owner, wanna talk to him?&quot; We immediately said &quot;heck yeah!&quot; Our waiter called him over and Frank was so friendly and welcoming. He talked to us for a while (more than I ever thought an owner of a restaurant would) which made us feel like VIP diners. He was also a delight and told us to give him a hello whenever we see him. So nice!

This restaurant has a lot of history and is a true Chicago gem. I&apos;m so glad to see them still operating during Covid and I will continue to eat here because every time I do, it is always a great experience!"
5,"I picked up my dinner for takeout last night and was nervous it wouldn&apos;t be as good as in the restaurant, but it was still so warm and delicious! I ordered the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare and was actually shocked (in a good way) by how much seafood was in it!! I&apos;ve ordered this dish at other Italian restaurants and always feel like there&apos;s not enough seafood. I would rate the dish 4.5/5 just because I was expecting a little more flavor/spice out of the spaghetti sauce. They also gave me some bread and salad in my to-go order which I didn&apos;t realize came with it. It&apos;s the little things right? Delicious food and would love to go back and actually dine in the restaurant next time!"
4,"We were on a walking tour in the Old Town area and decided on Topo Gigio for lunch I ordered the Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs, the spaghetti, and the red sauce was good and a good portion too but I was disappointed with the meatballs, they were bland had no garlicky herbal taste at all.
My friend ordered the Fusilli Alla Topo Gigio, their Signature Pasta Dish w/Chicken. She said it was very good and enough for a second meal.

 We ordered the Tiramisu for dessert which was really good and a nice portion to boot, good for sharing. I regret not asking the busboy for a new coffee because it looked like the coffee was sitting for a while. My friend ordered a Cappuccino but oddly they didn&apos;t sprinkle cinnamon or cocoa on top so we asked the busboy about it and he said &quot;they didn&apos;t have anything to sprinkle on top&quot;. Huh?

The staff was really nice. They brought water and iced tea all the time. Nice crusty bread with dinner. The waiter didn&apos;t mention the prices of the daily specials they started at $16.95 to $21.95 until we asked."
4,"Topo Gigio is a neighborhood gem. I am not the biggest fan of Italian food, but went back to this restaurant twice!

The outdoor seating in the backyard patio type of setting has such a romantic feel to it and helps you escape from the busy streets of Chicago. Definitely recommend for a family dinner, catching up with friends or even a date with your significant other. 

Plates ordered:
Bruschetta- hard to not be good, but loved the freshness of all the ingredients 

Fusilloni Tocco Delicato- Great light and fresh vegetarian option. Would probably not order again, because would want to try other options!

Fusilli alla Topo Gigio- My favorite dish here, the creamy sauce with the perfectly cooked chicken makes me keep coming back here!"
5,Wonderful food and wonderful service... the lemon fish was absolutely perfect and the pasta was delicious... the spot is charming and the staff is so nice and inviting... will be returning soon !!!
5,The best Italian restaurant in Chicago. The perfect combo of a little upscale but still has that family feel. My husband forgot his mask in the car and a team member said &quot;We have extra masks.&quot; Perfect al dente pasta (fusilli Topo Gigio is always my go-to). Gilberto was our server and was delightful. Been going here for years and will keep going back!
2,"I didn&apos;t have a good experience here. First, the place is EXTREMELY crowded. It&apos;s like they for waaaayyy too chairs into that space so there is no sense of your own space for meal and it kind of ruins the ambience. The waiter we had was  really short with us to the point of almost being rude. 
The meals we ordered were subpar. We ordered the 
Tortellini panna and it was just under flavored. I ordered the special of the Osso  Buco risotto and same. It just needed to be flavored more and it was lacking texture. Every bite was just mushy. The meat was super tender don&apos;t get me wrong but it was missing something. It was also under salted and desperately needed spice. just seems over priced for what they are offering. The one good thing was that the bread was warm and served with oil and Parmesan cheese and that it&apos;s walkiijg so distance time second city."

We ordered takeout from here a couple weeks ago and it knocked our socks off. Everything was fresh, great portions for the price still hot after we got home after picking it up. They&apos;re also open for indoor dining (they have a big door/windows I believe, so they meet the city&apos;s requirements). 1000% will be back 12/10 would recommend the conchiglie alla sarda. Can&apos;t miss dish!"
5,"Here&apos;s why Topo Gigio gets five stars in my book:
- The FOOD. Topo Gigio&apos;s cuisine is like a portal to Italy. The first bite of your appetizer transports you to your own private table in a villa in Capri. Then the aroma of your entree takes you on a gondola ride on the Grand Canal in Venice and what&apos;s that over there .. you&apos;re watching the sunset in Bologna where the shifting sun adds lifts in the red hues bathing the city in a golden light. Yes, the food is that good. My friend, who is one of the pickiest eaters I have ever met constantly asks me to meet her for lunch or dinner here so that says a lot. 

Here are my favorite items from the menu:
Appetizer - Calamari alla Griglia (Grilled Calamari in a Wine and Lemon Sauce.)
Entree - Conchiglie alla Sarda (Sea Shell Pasta in a Tomato-Cream Sauce with Ground Sausage, Peas and Pecorino Cheese.)
Desert - hands down BEST TIRAMISU at least in Chicago. 

- Atmosphere. They have lots of regulars that frequent the restaurant that gives it a family vibe (no, not like Olive Garden family vibe, better.) How do I know this? Because you can hear the conversations with them and the staff and it is a delight. The have plenty of outdoor seating and the inside is cozy and inviting. 

- Service. Our servers have been wonderful. We also always carry on a conversation with them (hence why they have so many regulars) and they know the menu like the back of their hand. They can tell you everything about the restaurant. 

- The owner. We got to meet one of the owners, Frank, who explained to us how fresh his food is and how he makes sure to only use authentic ingredients. A lot of his ingredients is flown in from Italy. He was talking to customers at the bar and we asked our server who that was and he said &quot;the owner, wanna talk to him?&quot; We immediately said &quot;heck yeah!&quot; Our waiter called him over and Frank was so friendly and welcoming. He talked to us for a while (more than I ever thought an owner of a restaurant would) which made us feel like VIP diners. He was also a delight and told us to give him a hello whenever we see him. So nice!

This restaurant has a lot of history and is a true Chicago gem. I&apos;m so glad to see them still operating during Covid and I will continue to eat here because every time I do, it is always a great experience!"
5,"I picked up my dinner for takeout last night and was nervous it wouldn&apos;t be as good as in the restaurant, but it was still so warm and delicious! I ordered the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare and was actually shocked (in a good way) by how much seafood was in it!! I&apos;ve ordered this dish at other Italian restaurants and always feel like there&apos;s not enough seafood. I would rate the dish 4.5/5 just because I was expecting a little more flavor/spice out of the spaghetti sauce. They also gave me some bread and salad in my to-go order which I didn&apos;t realize came with it. It&apos;s the little things right? Delicious food and would love to go back and actually dine in the restaurant next time!"
4,"We were on a walking tour in the Old Town area and decided on Topo Gigio for lunch I ordered the Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs, the spaghetti, and the red sauce was good and a good portion too but I was disappointed with the meatballs, they were bland had no garlicky herbal taste at all.
My friend ordered the Fusilli Alla Topo Gigio, their Signature Pasta Dish w/Chicken. She said it was very good and enough for a second meal.

 We ordered the Tiramisu for dessert which was really good and a nice portion to boot, good for sharing. I regret not asking the busboy for a new coffee because it looked like the coffee was sitting for a while. My friend ordered a Cappuccino but oddly they didn&apos;t sprinkle cinnamon or cocoa on top so we asked the busboy about it and he said &quot;they didn&apos;t have anything to sprinkle on top&quot;. Huh?

The staff was really nice. They brought water and iced tea all the time. Nice crusty bread with dinner. The waiter didn&apos;t mention the prices of the daily specials they started at $16.95 to $21.95 until we asked."
4,"Topo Gigio is a neighborhood gem. I am not the biggest fan of Italian food, but went back to this restaurant twice!

The outdoor seating in the backyard patio type of setting has such a romantic feel to it and helps you escape from the busy streets of Chicago. Definitely recommend for a family dinner, catching up with friends or even a date with your significant other. 

Plates ordered:
Bruschetta- hard to not be good, but loved the freshness of all the ingredients 

Fusilloni Tocco Delicato- Great light and fresh vegetarian option. Would probably not order again, because would want to try other options!

Fusilli alla Topo Gigio- My favorite dish here, the creamy sauce with the perfectly cooked chicken makes me keep coming back here!"
5,Wonderful food and wonderful service... the lemon fish was absolutely perfect and the pasta was delicious... the spot is charming and the staff is so nice and inviting... will be returning soon !!!
5,The best Italian restaurant in Chicago. The perfect combo of a little upscale but still has that family feel. My husband forgot his mask in the car and a team member said &quot;We have extra masks.&quot; Perfect al dente pasta (fusilli Topo Gigio is always my go-to). Gilberto was our server and was delightful. Been going here for years and will keep going back!
2,"I didn&apos;t have a good experience here. First, the place is EXTREMELY crowded. It&apos;s like they for waaaayyy too chairs into that space so there is no sense of your own space for meal and it kind of ruins the ambience. The waiter we had was  really short with us to the point of almost being rude. 
The meals we ordered were subpar. We ordered the 
Tortellini panna and it was just under flavored. I ordered the special of the Osso  Buco risotto and same. It just needed to be flavored more and it was lacking texture. Every bite was just mushy. The meat was super tender don&apos;t get me wrong but it was missing something. It was also under salted and desperately needed spice. just seems over priced for what they are offering. The one good thing was that the bread was warm and served with oil and Parmesan cheese and that it&apos;s walkiijg so distance time second city."
1,"What a rude person on the phone. We didn&apos;t even get to go there. Whoever it was, a woman that picks up the phone to make a reservation was very unpleasant.  I guess  I will not experience this place."
5,"Like many folks, I really love Italian food, and find myself craving it often. When I do get a craving, this is the place I go. On my most recent visit I had the frisée, fennel and radicchio salad tossed in a citrus vinaigrette, and thought it was excellent; imaginative ingredients that paired perfectly with the light dressing. For my main I chose a special, a seafood and pasta dish that was very similar to their fruitti de mare, but was somewhat spicier and featured the happy addition of large shrimp, all tossed in their well balanced marinara. Too good to share. Patio seating is always a treat, and a requirement for us during these pandemic times, but I&apos;ll be ordering takeout now that the weather&apos;s turned. I guess I&apos;ll have to procure my own bottle of Chianti and enjoy it without the great service they provide. Alas. I&apos;ll most definitely be back. And back. And..."
4,"It was late for lunchtime in the Windy City, and my friend and I wanted something that would warm us up, but also not be too filling. We checked on Yelp for lunch spots nearby and when Topo Gigio popped up, she endorsed it, as she had been there before. Off we went, ready for a cozy place with some delicious food. 

We were met at the entrance by a crisply-dressed host, who led us to our table. After perusing the menu, we both decided that the Tortellini soup sounded like the perfect lunch on this brisk day. Before it arrived, we enjoyed a selection of hot and fresh bread with some olive oil to keep our hunger at bay. 

When the soup arrived, I used some of the Parmesan cheese that the server had brought out with our bread basket and added a bit to the top of the soup. Once it melted a bit, it made the perfect peppy addition to the soup -- the proverbial cherry on top, if you will. We both devoured the soup, and at the end I even told my friend &quot;I could eat a whole pot of that soup!&quot; Something about the filling tortellini, the savory component to the broth, and the extra zest of the cheese on top hit the spot on that day. 

Our servers made sure to keep our water glasses filled, and didn&apos;t seem to mind that we only got a light lunch, still giving us attention and checking in if we needed anything. If you&apos;re looking for a quick lunch spot with delicious food and great service, Topo Gigio belongs at the top of your list!"
4,"My, gahd. Who&apos;s cooking my food back there?! 

I&apos;m not a huge pasta person, but I&apos;ll be one if we&apos;re going to Topo Gigio!

The Conchiglie Alla Sarda is absolutely the best way to go. It almost tastes like a blend of white and red paste. It quite honestly could be. I&apos;m still not even sure what I ordered, haha. Don&apos;t @ me, but I think the next time I come here, I&apos;ll have to ask for my pasta to be cooked a bit more. I like them borderline soggy, lol. 

Don&apos;t forget to order the grilled calamari. So worth it! It&apos;s basically an entree-sized snack. My boyfriend and I split the two. We were absolutely stuffed. Well, it&apos;s probably because we had bread too.

Definitely a fan but wouldn&apos;t murder for Topo Gigio."
5,"We had such a good meal at Topi Gigio! We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for somewhere to eat in Old Town on a Saturday. There was a 45 minute wait, but we got in within 25 min of putting our name in. 

We sat outside under a heat lamp, and it wasn&apos;t too chilly. The atmosphere was lively as expected. The service was fantastic as well!

There were three of us - two got the fusilli topo gigio, and another the spaghetti and meatballs. We would be happy to order the same thing over and over again!! There was plenty to take home for seconds as well. We were served complimentary bread and olive oil to start our meal, fresh out of the oven.

We were very satisfied with our meals!! I can&apos;t wait to come back and bring other friends!"
5,Best Italian place you will EVER eat at. Be sure to go on a weekend and order the fettuccine special! YUM!
5,"Authentic Italian with homemade pasta al dente.  
Definitely a restaurant to go back."
5,The ambience here was amaze. I don&apos;t think you can mess up pasta but topo Gigio&apos;s was outta this world!!!!. We started with burrata and each had a different dish. They were super flexible with my friend who was gluten free
5,"This is one of our favorite Italian places in the city. We&apos;ve never dined in, but when we order takeout they give us cute little side salads and crusty bread along with our pasta entrees. The pastas are phenomenal - my favorites are the Vic Damone, Conchiglie alla Sarda, and Fusilloni. SO good, and fast easy pick up to boot."
5,Amazing!!! The food was incredible!!!! The service was great!!! I will definitely be coming back.
5,"This place was amazing. The service, the ambiance and the food!!!! I got one of the pasta dishes, shown in the photos, it&apos;s one of the specialties. It was a huge portion with more than enough to take home. The waiter was amazing and knew everything about every kind of food and bottle of wine. The place is also a lot bigger than I thought! I will definitely be back!!!"
5,"Everything absolutely delicious!!! Sauces had the right consistency and flavor. Seafood all tasted fresh. Housemade fettuccine in lobster tomato sauce with seafood was a special which a shame because it can very easily be a go-to dish for me! Tiramisu was perfect finish.

1. Calamari alla Griglia - grilled calamari sauteed with lemon and wine sauce
2. Housemade fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, and clams in lobster tomato cream sauce
3. Conchiglie alla Sarda - seashell pasta in a tomato cream sauce with ground sausage, peas
4. Tiramisu

Portions very generous. Service was good."

The one good thing was that the bread was warm and served with oil and Parmesan cheese and that it&apos;s walkiijg so distance time second city."
1,"What a rude person on the phone. We didn&apos;t even get to go there. Whoever it was, a woman that picks up the phone to make a reservation was very unpleasant.  I guess  I will not experience this place."
5,"Like many folks, I really love Italian food, and find myself craving it often. When I do get a craving, this is the place I go. On my most recent visit I had the frisée, fennel and radicchio salad tossed in a citrus vinaigrette, and thought it was excellent; imaginative ingredients that paired perfectly with the light dressing. For my main I chose a special, a seafood and pasta dish that was very similar to their fruitti de mare, but was somewhat spicier and featured the happy addition of large shrimp, all tossed in their well balanced marinara. Too good to share. Patio seating is always a treat, and a requirement for us during these pandemic times, but I&apos;ll be ordering takeout now that the weather&apos;s turned. I guess I&apos;ll have to procure my own bottle of Chianti and enjoy it without the great service they provide. Alas. I&apos;ll most definitely be back. And back. And..."
4,"It was late for lunchtime in the Windy City, and my friend and I wanted something that would warm us up, but also not be too filling. We checked on Yelp for lunch spots nearby and when Topo Gigio popped up, she endorsed it, as she had been there before. Off we went, ready for a cozy place with some delicious food. 

We were met at the entrance by a crisply-dressed host, who led us to our table. After perusing the menu, we both decided that the Tortellini soup sounded like the perfect lunch on this brisk day. Before it arrived, we enjoyed a selection of hot and fresh bread with some olive oil to keep our hunger at bay. 

When the soup arrived, I used some of the Parmesan cheese that the server had brought out with our bread basket and added a bit to the top of the soup. Once it melted a bit, it made the perfect peppy addition to the soup -- the proverbial cherry on top, if you will. We both devoured the soup, and at the end I even told my friend &quot;I could eat a whole pot of that soup!&quot; Something about the filling tortellini, the savory component to the broth, and the extra zest of the cheese on top hit the spot on that day. 

Our servers made sure to keep our water glasses filled, and didn&apos;t seem to mind that we only got a light lunch, still giving us attention and checking in if we needed anything. If you&apos;re looking for a quick lunch spot with delicious food and great service, Topo Gigio belongs at the top of your list!"
4,"My, gahd. Who&apos;s cooking my food back there?! 

I&apos;m not a huge pasta person, but I&apos;ll be one if we&apos;re going to Topo Gigio!

The Conchiglie Alla Sarda is absolutely the best way to go. It almost tastes like a blend of white and red paste. It quite honestly could be. I&apos;m still not even sure what I ordered, haha. Don&apos;t @ me, but I think the next time I come here, I&apos;ll have to ask for my pasta to be cooked a bit more. I like them borderline soggy, lol. 

Don&apos;t forget to order the grilled calamari. So worth it! It&apos;s basically an entree-sized snack. My boyfriend and I split the two. We were absolutely stuffed. Well, it&apos;s probably because we had bread too.

Definitely a fan but wouldn&apos;t murder for Topo Gigio."
5,"We had such a good meal at Topi Gigio! We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for somewhere to eat in Old Town on a Saturday. There was a 45 minute wait, but we got in within 25 min of putting our name in. 

We sat outside under a heat lamp, and it wasn&apos;t too chilly. The atmosphere was lively as expected. The service was fantastic as well!

There were three of us - two got the fusilli topo gigio, and another the spaghetti and meatballs. We would be happy to order the same thing over and over again!! There was plenty to take home for seconds as well. We were served complimentary bread and olive oil to start our meal, fresh out of the oven.

We were very satisfied with our meals!! I can&apos;t wait to come back and bring other friends!"
5,Best Italian place you will EVER eat at. Be sure to go on a weekend and order the fettuccine special! YUM!
5,"Authentic Italian with homemade pasta al dente.  
Definitely a restaurant to go back."
5,The ambience here was amaze. I don&apos;t think you can mess up pasta but topo Gigio&apos;s was outta this world!!!!. We started with burrata and each had a different dish. They were super flexible with my friend who was gluten free
5,"This is one of our favorite Italian places in the city. We&apos;ve never dined in, but when we order takeout they give us cute little side salads and crusty bread along with our pasta entrees. The pastas are phenomenal - my favorites are the Vic Damone, Conchiglie alla Sarda, and Fusilloni. SO good, and fast easy pick up to boot."
5,Amazing!!! The food was incredible!!!! The service was great!!! I will definitely be coming back.
5,"This place was amazing. The service, the ambiance and the food!!!! I got one of the pasta dishes, shown in the photos, it&apos;s one of the specialties. It was a huge portion with more than enough to take home. The waiter was amazing and knew everything about every kind of food and bottle of wine. The place is also a lot bigger than I thought! I will definitely be back!!!"
5,"Everything absolutely delicious!!! Sauces had the right consistency and flavor. Seafood all tasted fresh. Housemade fettuccine in lobster tomato sauce with seafood was a special which a shame because it can very easily be a go-to dish for me! Tiramisu was perfect finish.

1. Calamari alla Griglia - grilled calamari sauteed with lemon and wine sauce
2. Housemade fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, and clams in lobster tomato cream sauce
3. Conchiglie alla Sarda - seashell pasta in a tomato cream sauce with ground sausage, peas
4. Tiramisu

Portions very generous. Service was good."
5,"The reviews are true about the conchiglie alla sarda. It&apos;s frickin&apos; amazing, you guys. It&apos;s seashell past in a tomato cream sauce with italian sausage, peas and pecorino cheese and its absolutely TO DIE FOR. 

We ordered takeout from here a couple weeks ago and it knocked our socks off. Everything was fresh, great portions for the price still hot after we got home after picking it up. They&apos;re also open for indoor dining (they have a big door/windows I believe, so they meet the city&apos;s requirements). 1000% will be back 12/10 would recommend the conchiglie alla sarda. Can&apos;t miss dish!"
5,"Here&apos;s why Topo Gigio gets five stars in my book:
- The FOOD. Topo Gigio&apos;s cuisine is like a portal to Italy. The first bite of your appetizer transports you to your own private table in a villa in Capri. Then the aroma of your entree takes you on a gondola ride on the Grand Canal in Venice and what&apos;s that over there .. you&apos;re watching the sunset in Bologna where the shifting sun adds lifts in the red hues bathing the city in a golden light. Yes, the food is that good. My friend, who is one of the pickiest eaters I have ever met constantly asks me to meet her for lunch or dinner here so that says a lot. 

Here are my favorite items from the menu:
Appetizer - Calamari alla Griglia (Grilled Calamari in a Wine and Lemon Sauce.)
Entree - Conchiglie alla Sarda (Sea Shell Pasta in a Tomato-Cream Sauce with Ground Sausage, Peas and Pecorino Cheese.)
Desert - hands down BEST TIRAMISU at least in Chicago. 

- Atmosphere. They have lots of regulars that frequent the restaurant that gives it a family vibe (no, not like Olive Garden family vibe, better.) How do I know this? Because you can hear the conversations with them and the staff and it is a delight. The have plenty of outdoor seating and the inside is cozy and inviting. 

- Service. Our servers have been wonderful. We also always carry on a conversation with them (hence why they have so many regulars) and they know the menu like the back of their hand. They can tell you everything about the restaurant. 

- The owner. We got to meet one of the owners, Frank, who explained to us how fresh his food is and how he makes sure to only use authentic ingredients. A lot of his ingredients is flown in from Italy. He was talking to customers at the bar and we asked our server who that was and he said &quot;the owner, wanna talk to him?&quot; We immediately said &quot;heck yeah!&quot; Our waiter called him over and Frank was so friendly and welcoming. He talked to us for a while (more than I ever thought an owner of a restaurant would) which made us feel like VIP diners. He was also a delight and told us to give him a hello whenever we see him. So nice!

This restaurant has a lot of history and is a true Chicago gem. I&apos;m so glad to see them still operating during Covid and I will continue to eat here because every time I do, it is always a great experience!"
5,"I picked up my dinner for takeout last night and was nervous it wouldn&apos;t be as good as in the restaurant, but it was still so warm and delicious! I ordered the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare and was actually shocked (in a good way) by how much seafood was in it!! I&apos;ve ordered this dish at other Italian restaurants and always feel like there&apos;s not enough seafood. I would rate the dish 4.5/5 just because I was expecting a little more flavor/spice out of the spaghetti sauce. They also gave me some bread and salad in my to-go order which I didn&apos;t realize came with it. It&apos;s the little things right? Delicious food and would love to go back and actually dine in the restaurant next time!"
4,"We were on a walking tour in the Old Town area and decided on Topo Gigio for lunch I ordered the Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs, the spaghetti, and the red sauce was good and a good portion too but I was disappointed with the meatballs, they were bland had no garlicky herbal taste at all.
My friend ordered the Fusilli Alla Topo Gigio, their Signature Pasta Dish w/Chicken. She said it was very good and enough for a second meal.

 We ordered the Tiramisu for dessert which was really good and a nice portion to boot, good for sharing. I regret not asking the busboy for a new coffee because it looked like the coffee was sitting for a while. My friend ordered a Cappuccino but oddly they didn&apos;t sprinkle cinnamon or cocoa on top so we asked the busboy about it and he said &quot;they didn&apos;t have anything to sprinkle on top&quot;. Huh?

The staff was really nice. They brought water and iced tea all the time. Nice crusty bread with dinner. The waiter didn&apos;t mention the prices of the daily specials they started at $16.95 to $21.95 until we asked."
4,"Topo Gigio is a neighborhood gem. I am not the biggest fan of Italian food, but went back to this restaurant twice!

The outdoor seating in the backyard patio type of setting has such a romantic feel to it and helps you escape from the busy streets of Chicago. Definitely recommend for a family dinner, catching up with friends or even a date with your significant other. 

Plates ordered:
Bruschetta- hard to not be good, but loved the freshness of all the ingredients 

Fusilloni Tocco Delicato- Great light and fresh vegetarian option. Would probably not order again, because would want to try other options!

Fusilli alla Topo Gigio- My favorite dish here, the creamy sauce with the perfectly cooked chicken makes me keep coming back here!"
5,Wonderful food and wonderful service... the lemon fish was absolutely perfect and the pasta was delicious... the spot is charming and the staff is so nice and inviting... will be returning soon !!!
5,The best Italian restaurant in Chicago. The perfect combo of a little upscale but still has that family feel. My husband forgot his mask in the car and a team member said &quot;We have extra masks.&quot; Perfect al dente pasta (fusilli Topo Gigio is always my go-to). Gilberto was our server and was delightful. Been going here for years and will keep going back!
2,"I didn&apos;t have a good experience here. First, the place is EXTREMELY crowded. It&apos;s like they for waaaayyy too chairs into that space so there is no sense of your own space for meal and it kind of ruins the ambience. The waiter we had was  really short with us to the point of almost being rude. 
The meals we ordered were subpar. We ordered the 
Tortellini panna and it was just under flavored. I ordered the special of the Osso  Buco risotto and same. It just needed to be flavored more and it was lacking texture. Every bite was just mushy. The meat was super tender don&apos;t get me wrong but it was missing something. It was also under salted and desperately needed spice. just seems over priced for what they are offering. The one good thing was that the bread was warm and served with oil and Parmesan cheese and that it&apos;s walkiijg so distance time second city."

We ordered takeout from here a couple weeks ago and it knocked our socks off. Everything was fresh, great portions for the price still hot after we got home after picking it up. They&apos;re also open for indoor dining (they have a big door/windows I believe, so they meet the city&apos;s requirements). 1000% will be back 12/10 would recommend the conchiglie alla sarda. Can&apos;t miss dish!"
5,"Here&apos;s why Topo Gigio gets five stars in my book:
- The FOOD. Topo Gigio&apos;s cuisine is like a portal to Italy. The first bite of your appetizer transports you to your own private table in a villa in Capri. Then the aroma of your entree takes you on a gondola ride on the Grand Canal in Venice and what&apos;s that over there .. you&apos;re watching the sunset in Bologna where the shifting sun adds lifts in the red hues bathing the city in a golden light. Yes, the food is that good. My friend, who is one of the pickiest eaters I have ever met constantly asks me to meet her for lunch or dinner here so that says a lot. 

Here are my favorite items from the menu:
Appetizer - Calamari alla Griglia (Grilled Calamari in a Wine and Lemon Sauce.)
Entree - Conchiglie alla Sarda (Sea Shell Pasta in a Tomato-Cream Sauce with Ground Sausage, Peas and Pecorino Cheese.)
Desert - hands down BEST TIRAMISU at least in Chicago. 

- Atmosphere. They have lots of regulars that frequent the restaurant that gives it a family vibe (no, not like Olive Garden family vibe, better.) How do I know this? Because you can hear the conversations with them and the staff and it is a delight. The have plenty of outdoor seating and the inside is cozy and inviting. 

- Service. Our servers have been wonderful. We also always carry on a conversation with them (hence why they have so many regulars) and they know the menu like the back of their hand. They can tell you everything about the restaurant. 

- The owner. We got to meet one of the owners, Frank, who explained to us how fresh his food is and how he makes sure to only use authentic ingredients. A lot of his ingredients is flown in from Italy. He was talking to customers at the bar and we asked our server who that was and he said &quot;the owner, wanna talk to him?&quot; We immediately said &quot;heck yeah!&quot; Our waiter called him over and Frank was so friendly and welcoming. He talked to us for a while (more than I ever thought an owner of a restaurant would) which made us feel like VIP diners. He was also a delight and told us to give him a hello whenever we see him. So nice!

This restaurant has a lot of history and is a true Chicago gem. I&apos;m so glad to see them still operating during Covid and I will continue to eat here because every time I do, it is always a great experience!"
5,"I picked up my dinner for takeout last night and was nervous it wouldn&apos;t be as good as in the restaurant, but it was still so warm and delicious! I ordered the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare and was actually shocked (in a good way) by how much seafood was in it!! I&apos;ve ordered this dish at other Italian restaurants and always feel like there&apos;s not enough seafood. I would rate the dish 4.5/5 just because I was expecting a little more flavor/spice out of the spaghetti sauce. They also gave me some bread and salad in my to-go order which I didn&apos;t realize came with it. It&apos;s the little things right? Delicious food and would love to go back and actually dine in the restaurant next time!"
4,"We were on a walking tour in the Old Town area and decided on Topo Gigio for lunch I ordered the Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs, the spaghetti, and the red sauce was good and a good portion too but I was disappointed with the meatballs, they were bland had no garlicky herbal taste at all.
My friend ordered the Fusilli Alla Topo Gigio, their Signature Pasta Dish w/Chicken. She said it was very good and enough for a second meal.

 We ordered the Tiramisu for dessert which was really good and a nice portion to boot, good for sharing. I regret not asking the busboy for a new coffee because it looked like the coffee was sitting for a while. My friend ordered a Cappuccino but oddly they didn&apos;t sprinkle cinnamon or cocoa on top so we asked the busboy about it and he said &quot;they didn&apos;t have anything to sprinkle on top&quot;. Huh?

The staff was really nice. They brought water and iced tea all the time. Nice crusty bread with dinner. The waiter didn&apos;t mention the prices of the daily specials they started at $16.95 to $21.95 until we asked."
4,"Topo Gigio is a neighborhood gem. I am not the biggest fan of Italian food, but went back to this restaurant twice!

The outdoor seating in the backyard patio type of setting has such a romantic feel to it and helps you escape from the busy streets of Chicago. Definitely recommend for a family dinner, catching up with friends or even a date with your significant other. 

Plates ordered:
Bruschetta- hard to not be good, but loved the freshness of all the ingredients 

Fusilloni Tocco Delicato- Great light and fresh vegetarian option. Would probably not order again, because would want to try other options!

Fusilli alla Topo Gigio- My favorite dish here, the creamy sauce with the perfectly cooked chicken makes me keep coming back here!"
5,Wonderful food and wonderful service... the lemon fish was absolutely perfect and the pasta was delicious... the spot is charming and the staff is so nice and inviting... will be returning soon !!!
5,The best Italian restaurant in Chicago. The perfect combo of a little upscale but still has that family feel. My husband forgot his mask in the car and a team member said &quot;We have extra masks.&quot; Perfect al dente pasta (fusilli Topo Gigio is always my go-to). Gilberto was our server and was delightful. Been going here for years and will keep going back!
2,"I didn&apos;t have a good experience here. First, the place is EXTREMELY crowded. It&apos;s like they for waaaayyy too chairs into that space so there is no sense of your own space for meal and it kind of ruins the ambience. The waiter we had was  really short with us to the point of almost being rude. 
The meals we ordered were subpar. We ordered the 
Tortellini panna and it was just under flavored. I ordered the special of the Osso  Buco risotto and same. It just needed to be flavored more and it was lacking texture. Every bite was just mushy. The meat was super tender don&apos;t get me wrong but it was missing something. It was also under salted and desperately needed spice. just seems over priced for what they are offering. The one good thing was that the bread was warm and served with oil and Parmesan cheese and that it&apos;s walkiijg so distance time second city."
1,"What a rude person on the phone. We didn&apos;t even get to go there. Whoever it was, a woman that picks up the phone to make a reservation was very unpleasant.  I guess  I will not experience this place."
5,"Like many folks, I really love Italian food, and find myself craving it often. When I do get a craving, this is the place I go. On my most recent visit I had the frisée, fennel and radicchio salad tossed in a citrus vinaigrette, and thought it was excellent; imaginative ingredients that paired perfectly with the light dressing. For my main I chose a special, a seafood and pasta dish that was very similar to their fruitti de mare, but was somewhat spicier and featured the happy addition of large shrimp, all tossed in their well balanced marinara. Too good to share. Patio seating is always a treat, and a requirement for us during these pandemic times, but I&apos;ll be ordering takeout now that the weather&apos;s turned. I guess I&apos;ll have to procure my own bottle of Chianti and enjoy it without the great service they provide. Alas. I&apos;ll most definitely be back. And back. And..."
4,"It was late for lunchtime in the Windy City, and my friend and I wanted something that would warm us up, but also not be too filling. We checked on Yelp for lunch spots nearby and when Topo Gigio popped up, she endorsed it, as she had been there before. Off we went, ready for a cozy place with some delicious food. 

We were met at the entrance by a crisply-dressed host, who led us to our table. After perusing the menu, we both decided that the Tortellini soup sounded like the perfect lunch on this brisk day. Before it arrived, we enjoyed a selection of hot and fresh bread with some olive oil to keep our hunger at bay. 

When the soup arrived, I used some of the Parmesan cheese that the server had brought out with our bread basket and added a bit to the top of the soup. Once it melted a bit, it made the perfect peppy addition to the soup -- the proverbial cherry on top, if you will. We both devoured the soup, and at the end I even told my friend &quot;I could eat a whole pot of that soup!&quot; Something about the filling tortellini, the savory component to the broth, and the extra zest of the cheese on top hit the spot on that day. 

Our servers made sure to keep our water glasses filled, and didn&apos;t seem to mind that we only got a light lunch, still giving us attention and checking in if we needed anything. If you&apos;re looking for a quick lunch spot with delicious food and great service, Topo Gigio belongs at the top of your list!"
4,"My, gahd. Who&apos;s cooking my food back there?! 

I&apos;m not a huge pasta person, but I&apos;ll be one if we&apos;re going to Topo Gigio!

The Conchiglie Alla Sarda is absolutely the best way to go. It almost tastes like a blend of white and red paste. It quite honestly could be. I&apos;m still not even sure what I ordered, haha. Don&apos;t @ me, but I think the next time I come here, I&apos;ll have to ask for my pasta to be cooked a bit more. I like them borderline soggy, lol. 

Don&apos;t forget to order the grilled calamari. So worth it! It&apos;s basically an entree-sized snack. My boyfriend and I split the two. We were absolutely stuffed. Well, it&apos;s probably because we had bread too.

Definitely a fan but wouldn&apos;t murder for Topo Gigio."
5,"We had such a good meal at Topi Gigio! We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for somewhere to eat in Old Town on a Saturday. There was a 45 minute wait, but we got in within 25 min of putting our name in. 

We sat outside under a heat lamp, and it wasn&apos;t too chilly. The atmosphere was lively as expected. The service was fantastic as well!

There were three of us - two got the fusilli topo gigio, and another the spaghetti and meatballs. We would be happy to order the same thing over and over again!! There was plenty to take home for seconds as well. We were served complimentary bread and olive oil to start our meal, fresh out of the oven.

We were very satisfied with our meals!! I can&apos;t wait to come back and bring other friends!"
5,Best Italian place you will EVER eat at. Be sure to go on a weekend and order the fettuccine special! YUM!
5,"Authentic Italian with homemade pasta al dente.  
Definitely a restaurant to go back."
5,The ambience here was amaze. I don&apos;t think you can mess up pasta but topo Gigio&apos;s was outta this world!!!!. We started with burrata and each had a different dish. They were super flexible with my friend who was gluten free
5,"This is one of our favorite Italian places in the city. We&apos;ve never dined in, but when we order takeout they give us cute little side salads and crusty bread along with our pasta entrees. The pastas are phenomenal - my favorites are the Vic Damone, Conchiglie alla Sarda, and Fusilloni. SO good, and fast easy pick up to boot."
5,Amazing!!! The food was incredible!!!! The service was great!!! I will definitely be coming back.
5,"This place was amazing. The service, the ambiance and the food!!!! I got one of the pasta dishes, shown in the photos, it&apos;s one of the specialties. It was a huge portion with more than enough to take home. The waiter was amazing and knew everything about every kind of food and bottle of wine. The place is also a lot bigger than I thought! I will definitely be back!!!"
5,"Everything absolutely delicious!!! Sauces had the right consistency and flavor. Seafood all tasted fresh. Housemade fettuccine in lobster tomato sauce with seafood was a special which a shame because it can very easily be a go-to dish for me! Tiramisu was perfect finish.

1. Calamari alla Griglia - grilled calamari sauteed with lemon and wine sauce
2. Housemade fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, and clams in lobster tomato cream sauce
3. Conchiglie alla Sarda - seashell pasta in a tomato cream sauce with ground sausage, peas
4. Tiramisu

Portions very generous. Service was good."

The one good thing was that the bread was warm and served with oil and Parmesan cheese and that it&apos;s walkiijg so distance time second city."
1,"What a rude person on the phone. We didn&apos;t even get to go there. Whoever it was, a woman that picks up the phone to make a reservation was very unpleasant.  I guess  I will not experience this place."
5,"Like many folks, I really love Italian food, and find myself craving it often. When I do get a craving, this is the place I go. On my most recent visit I had the frisée, fennel and radicchio salad tossed in a citrus vinaigrette, and thought it was excellent; imaginative ingredients that paired perfectly with the light dressing. For my main I chose a special, a seafood and pasta dish that was very similar to their fruitti de mare, but was somewhat spicier and featured the happy addition of large shrimp, all tossed in their well balanced marinara. Too good to share. Patio seating is always a treat, and a requirement for us during these pandemic times, but I&apos;ll be ordering takeout now that the weather&apos;s turned. I guess I&apos;ll have to procure my own bottle of Chianti and enjoy it without the great service they provide. Alas. I&apos;ll most definitely be back. And back. And..."
4,"It was late for lunchtime in the Windy City, and my friend and I wanted something that would warm us up, but also not be too filling. We checked on Yelp for lunch spots nearby and when Topo Gigio popped up, she endorsed it, as she had been there before. Off we went, ready for a cozy place with some delicious food. 

We were met at the entrance by a crisply-dressed host, who led us to our table. After perusing the menu, we both decided that the Tortellini soup sounded like the perfect lunch on this brisk day. Before it arrived, we enjoyed a selection of hot and fresh bread with some olive oil to keep our hunger at bay. 

When the soup arrived, I used some of the Parmesan cheese that the server had brought out with our bread basket and added a bit to the top of the soup. Once it melted a bit, it made the perfect peppy addition to the soup -- the proverbial cherry on top, if you will. We both devoured the soup, and at the end I even told my friend &quot;I could eat a whole pot of that soup!&quot; Something about the filling tortellini, the savory component to the broth, and the extra zest of the cheese on top hit the spot on that day. 

Our servers made sure to keep our water glasses filled, and didn&apos;t seem to mind that we only got a light lunch, still giving us attention and checking in if we needed anything. If you&apos;re looking for a quick lunch spot with delicious food and great service, Topo Gigio belongs at the top of your list!"
4,"My, gahd. Who&apos;s cooking my food back there?! 

I&apos;m not a huge pasta person, but I&apos;ll be one if we&apos;re going to Topo Gigio!

The Conchiglie Alla Sarda is absolutely the best way to go. It almost tastes like a blend of white and red paste. It quite honestly could be. I&apos;m still not even sure what I ordered, haha. Don&apos;t @ me, but I think the next time I come here, I&apos;ll have to ask for my pasta to be cooked a bit more. I like them borderline soggy, lol. 

Don&apos;t forget to order the grilled calamari. So worth it! It&apos;s basically an entree-sized snack. My boyfriend and I split the two. We were absolutely stuffed. Well, it&apos;s probably because we had bread too.

Definitely a fan but wouldn&apos;t murder for Topo Gigio."
5,"We had such a good meal at Topi Gigio! We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for somewhere to eat in Old Town on a Saturday. There was a 45 minute wait, but we got in within 25 min of putting our name in. 

We sat outside under a heat lamp, and it wasn&apos;t too chilly. The atmosphere was lively as expected. The service was fantastic as well!

There were three of us - two got the fusilli topo gigio, and another the spaghetti and meatballs. We would be happy to order the same thing over and over again!! There was plenty to take home for seconds as well. We were served complimentary bread and olive oil to start our meal, fresh out of the oven.

We were very satisfied with our meals!! I can&apos;t wait to come back and bring other friends!"
5,Best Italian place you will EVER eat at. Be sure to go on a weekend and order the fettuccine special! YUM!
5,"Authentic Italian with homemade pasta al dente.  
Definitely a restaurant to go back."
5,The ambience here was amaze. I don&apos;t think you can mess up pasta but topo Gigio&apos;s was outta this world!!!!. We started with burrata and each had a different dish. They were super flexible with my friend who was gluten free
5,"This is one of our favorite Italian places in the city. We&apos;ve never dined in, but when we order takeout they give us cute little side salads and crusty bread along with our pasta entrees. The pastas are phenomenal - my favorites are the Vic Damone, Conchiglie alla Sarda, and Fusilloni. SO good, and fast easy pick up to boot."
5,Amazing!!! The food was incredible!!!! The service was great!!! I will definitely be coming back.
5,"This place was amazing. The service, the ambiance and the food!!!! I got one of the pasta dishes, shown in the photos, it&apos;s one of the specialties. It was a huge portion with more than enough to take home. The waiter was amazing and knew everything about every kind of food and bottle of wine. The place is also a lot bigger than I thought! I will definitely be back!!!"
5,"Everything absolutely delicious!!! Sauces had the right consistency and flavor. Seafood all tasted fresh. Housemade fettuccine in lobster tomato sauce with seafood was a special which a shame because it can very easily be a go-to dish for me! Tiramisu was perfect finish.

1. Calamari alla Griglia - grilled calamari sauteed with lemon and wine sauce
2. Housemade fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, and clams in lobster tomato cream sauce
3. Conchiglie alla Sarda - seashell pasta in a tomato cream sauce with ground sausage, peas
4. Tiramisu

Portions very generous. Service was good."
5,"The reviews are true about the conchiglie alla sarda. It&apos;s frickin&apos; amazing, you guys. It&apos;s seashell past in a tomato cream sauce with italian sausage, peas and pecorino cheese and its absolutely TO DIE FOR. 

We ordered takeout from here a couple weeks ago and it knocked our socks off. Everything was fresh, great portions for the price still hot after we got home after picking it up. They&apos;re also open for indoor dining (they have a big door/windows I believe, so they meet the city&apos;s requirements). 1000% will be back 12/10 would recommend the conchiglie alla sarda. Can&apos;t miss dish!"
5,"Here&apos;s why Topo Gigio gets five stars in my book:
- The FOOD. Topo Gigio&apos;s cuisine is like a portal to Italy. The first bite of your appetizer transports you to your own private table in a villa in Capri. Then the aroma of your entree takes you on a gondola ride on the Grand Canal in Venice and what&apos;s that over there .. you&apos;re watching the sunset in Bologna where the shifting sun adds lifts in the red hues bathing the city in a golden light. Yes, the food is that good. My friend, who is one of the pickiest eaters I have ever met constantly asks me to meet her for lunch or dinner here so that says a lot. 

Here are my favorite items from the menu:
Appetizer - Calamari alla Griglia (Grilled Calamari in a Wine and Lemon Sauce.)
Entree - Conchiglie alla Sarda (Sea Shell Pasta in a Tomato-Cream Sauce with Ground Sausage, Peas and Pecorino Cheese.)
Desert - hands down BEST TIRAMISU at least in Chicago. 

- Atmosphere. They have lots of regulars that frequent the restaurant that gives it a family vibe (no, not like Olive Garden family vibe, better.) How do I know this? Because you can hear the conversations with them and the staff and it is a delight. The have plenty of outdoor seating and the inside is cozy and inviting. 

- Service. Our servers have been wonderful. We also always carry on a conversation with them (hence why they have so many regulars) and they know the menu like the back of their hand. They can tell you everything about the restaurant. 

- The owner. We got to meet one of the owners, Frank, who explained to us how fresh his food is and how he makes sure to only use authentic ingredients. A lot of his ingredients is flown in from Italy. He was talking to customers at the bar and we asked our server who that was and he said &quot;the owner, wanna talk to him?&quot; We immediately said &quot;heck yeah!&quot; Our waiter called him over and Frank was so friendly and welcoming. He talked to us for a while (more than I ever thought an owner of a restaurant would) which made us feel like VIP diners. He was also a delight and told us to give him a hello whenever we see him. So nice!

This restaurant has a lot of history and is a true Chicago gem. I&apos;m so glad to see them still operating during Covid and I will continue to eat here because every time I do, it is always a great experience!"
5,"I picked up my dinner for takeout last night and was nervous it wouldn&apos;t be as good as in the restaurant, but it was still so warm and delicious! I ordered the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare and was actually shocked (in a good way) by how much seafood was in it!! I&apos;ve ordered this dish at other Italian restaurants and always feel like there&apos;s not enough seafood. I would rate the dish 4.5/5 just because I was expecting a little more flavor/spice out of the spaghetti sauce. They also gave me some bread and salad in my to-go order which I didn&apos;t realize came with it. It&apos;s the little things right? Delicious food and would love to go back and actually dine in the restaurant next time!"
4,"We were on a walking tour in the Old Town area and decided on Topo Gigio for lunch I ordered the Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs, the spaghetti, and the red sauce was good and a good portion too but I was disappointed with the meatballs, they were bland had no garlicky herbal taste at all.
My friend ordered the Fusilli Alla Topo Gigio, their Signature Pasta Dish w/Chicken. She said it was very good and enough for a second meal.

 We ordered the Tiramisu for dessert which was really good and a nice portion to boot, good for sharing. I regret not asking the busboy for a new coffee because it looked like the coffee was sitting for a while. My friend ordered a Cappuccino but oddly they didn&apos;t sprinkle cinnamon or cocoa on top so we asked the busboy about it and he said &quot;they didn&apos;t have anything to sprinkle on top&quot;. Huh?

The staff was really nice. They brought water and iced tea all the time. Nice crusty bread with dinner. The waiter didn&apos;t mention the prices of the daily specials they started at $16.95 to $21.95 until we asked."
4,"Topo Gigio is a neighborhood gem. I am not the biggest fan of Italian food, but went back to this restaurant twice!

The outdoor seating in the backyard patio type of setting has such a romantic feel to it and helps you escape from the busy streets of Chicago. Definitely recommend for a family dinner, catching up with friends or even a date with your significant other. 

Plates ordered:
Bruschetta- hard to not be good, but loved the freshness of all the ingredients 

Fusilloni Tocco Delicato- Great light and fresh vegetarian option. Would probably not order again, because would want to try other options!

Fusilli alla Topo Gigio- My favorite dish here, the creamy sauce with the perfectly cooked chicken makes me keep coming back here!"
5,Wonderful food and wonderful service... the lemon fish was absolutely perfect and the pasta was delicious... the spot is charming and the staff is so nice and inviting... will be returning soon !!!
5,The best Italian restaurant in Chicago. The perfect combo of a little upscale but still has that family feel. My husband forgot his mask in the car and a team member said &quot;We have extra masks.&quot; Perfect al dente pasta (fusilli Topo Gigio is always my go-to). Gilberto was our server and was delightful. Been going here for years and will keep going back!
2,"I didn&apos;t have a good experience here. First, the place is EXTREMELY crowded. It&apos;s like they for waaaayyy too chairs into that space so there is no sense of your own space for meal and it kind of ruins the ambience. The waiter we had was  really short with us to the point of almost being rude. 
The meals we ordered were subpar. We ordered the 
Tortellini panna and it was just under flavored. I ordered the special of the Osso  Buco risotto and same. It just needed to be flavored more and it was lacking texture. Every bite was just mushy. The meat was super tender don&apos;t get me wrong but it was missing something. It was also under salted and desperately needed spice. just seems over priced for what they are offering. The one good thing was that the bread was warm and served with oil and Parmesan cheese and that it&apos;s walkiijg so distance time second city."

We ordered takeout from here a couple weeks ago and it knocked our socks off. Everything was fresh, great portions for the price still hot after we got home after picking it up. They&apos;re also open for indoor dining (they have a big door/windows I believe, so they meet the city&apos;s requirements). 1000% will be back 12/10 would recommend the conchiglie alla sarda. Can&apos;t miss dish!"
5,"Here&apos;s why Topo Gigio gets five stars in my book:
- The FOOD. Topo Gigio&apos;s cuisine is like a portal to Italy. The first bite of your appetizer transports you to your own private table in a villa in Capri. Then the aroma of your entree takes you on a gondola ride on the Grand Canal in Venice and what&apos;s that over there .. you&apos;re watching the sunset in Bologna where the shifting sun adds lifts in the red hues bathing the city in a golden light. Yes, the food is that good. My friend, who is one of the pickiest eaters I have ever met constantly asks me to meet her for lunch or dinner here so that says a lot. 

Here are my favorite items from the menu:
Appetizer - Calamari alla Griglia (Grilled Calamari in a Wine and Lemon Sauce.)
Entree - Conchiglie alla Sarda (Sea Shell Pasta in a Tomato-Cream Sauce with Ground Sausage, Peas and Pecorino Cheese.)
Desert - hands down BEST TIRAMISU at least in Chicago. 

- Atmosphere. They have lots of regulars that frequent the restaurant that gives it a family vibe (no, not like Olive Garden family vibe, better.) How do I know this? Because you can hear the conversations with them and the staff and it is a delight. The have plenty of outdoor seating and the inside is cozy and inviting. 

- Service. Our servers have been wonderful. We also always carry on a conversation with them (hence why they have so many regulars) and they know the menu like the back of their hand. They can tell you everything about the restaurant. 

- The owner. We got to meet one of the owners, Frank, who explained to us how fresh his food is and how he makes sure to only use authentic ingredients. A lot of his ingredients is flown in from Italy. He was talking to customers at the bar and we asked our server who that was and he said &quot;the owner, wanna talk to him?&quot; We immediately said &quot;heck yeah!&quot; Our waiter called him over and Frank was so friendly and welcoming. He talked to us for a while (more than I ever thought an owner of a restaurant would) which made us feel like VIP diners. He was also a delight and told us to give him a hello whenever we see him. So nice!

This restaurant has a lot of history and is a true Chicago gem. I&apos;m so glad to see them still operating during Covid and I will continue to eat here because every time I do, it is always a great experience!"
5,"I picked up my dinner for takeout last night and was nervous it wouldn&apos;t be as good as in the restaurant, but it was still so warm and delicious! I ordered the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare and was actually shocked (in a good way) by how much seafood was in it!! I&apos;ve ordered this dish at other Italian restaurants and always feel like there&apos;s not enough seafood. I would rate the dish 4.5/5 just because I was expecting a little more flavor/spice out of the spaghetti sauce. They also gave me some bread and salad in my to-go order which I didn&apos;t realize came with it. It&apos;s the little things right? Delicious food and would love to go back and actually dine in the restaurant next time!"
4,"We were on a walking tour in the Old Town area and decided on Topo Gigio for lunch I ordered the Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs, the spaghetti, and the red sauce was good and a good portion too but I was disappointed with the meatballs, they were bland had no garlicky herbal taste at all.
My friend ordered the Fusilli Alla Topo Gigio, their Signature Pasta Dish w/Chicken. She said it was very good and enough for a second meal.

 We ordered the Tiramisu for dessert which was really good and a nice portion to boot, good for sharing. I regret not asking the busboy for a new coffee because it looked like the coffee was sitting for a while. My friend ordered a Cappuccino but oddly they didn&apos;t sprinkle cinnamon or cocoa on top so we asked the busboy about it and he said &quot;they didn&apos;t have anything to sprinkle on top&quot;. Huh?

The staff was really nice. They brought water and iced tea all the time. Nice crusty bread with dinner. The waiter didn&apos;t mention the prices of the daily specials they started at $16.95 to $21.95 until we asked."
4,"Topo Gigio is a neighborhood gem. I am not the biggest fan of Italian food, but went back to this restaurant twice!

The outdoor seating in the backyard patio type of setting has such a romantic feel to it and helps you escape from the busy streets of Chicago. Definitely recommend for a family dinner, catching up with friends or even a date with your significant other. 

Plates ordered:
Bruschetta- hard to not be good, but loved the freshness of all the ingredients 

Fusilloni Tocco Delicato- Great light and fresh vegetarian option. Would probably not order again, because would want to try other options!

Fusilli alla Topo Gigio- My favorite dish here, the creamy sauce with the perfectly cooked chicken makes me keep coming back here!"
5,Wonderful food and wonderful service... the lemon fish was absolutely perfect and the pasta was delicious... the spot is charming and the staff is so nice and inviting... will be returning soon !!!
5,The best Italian restaurant in Chicago. The perfect combo of a little upscale but still has that family feel. My husband forgot his mask in the car and a team member said &quot;We have extra masks.&quot; Perfect al dente pasta (fusilli Topo Gigio is always my go-to). Gilberto was our server and was delightful. Been going here for years and will keep going back!
2,"I didn&apos;t have a good experience here. First, the place is EXTREMELY crowded. It&apos;s like they for waaaayyy too chairs into that space so there is no sense of your own space for meal and it kind of ruins the ambience. The waiter we had was  really short with us to the point of almost being rude. 
The meals we ordered were subpar. We ordered the 
Tortellini panna and it was just under flavored. I ordered the special of the Osso  Buco risotto and same. It just needed to be flavored more and it was lacking texture. Every bite was just mushy. The meat was super tender don&apos;t get me wrong but it was missing something. It was also under salted and desperately needed spice. just seems over priced for what they are offering. The one good thing was that the bread was warm and served with oil and Parmesan cheese and that it&apos;s walkiijg so distance time second city."
1,"What a rude person on the phone. We didn&apos;t even get to go there. Whoever it was, a woman that picks up the phone to make a reservation was very unpleasant.  I guess  I will not experience this place."
5,"Like many folks, I really love Italian food, and find myself craving it often. When I do get a craving, this is the place I go. On my most recent visit I had the frisée, fennel and radicchio salad tossed in a citrus vinaigrette, and thought it was excellent; imaginative ingredients that paired perfectly with the light dressing. For my main I chose a special, a seafood and pasta dish that was very similar to their fruitti de mare, but was somewhat spicier and featured the happy addition of large shrimp, all tossed in their well balanced marinara. Too good to share. Patio seating is always a treat, and a requirement for us during these pandemic times, but I&apos;ll be ordering takeout now that the weather&apos;s turned. I guess I&apos;ll have to procure my own bottle of Chianti and enjoy it without the great service they provide. Alas. I&apos;ll most definitely be back. And back. And..."
4,"It was late for lunchtime in the Windy City, and my friend and I wanted something that would warm us up, but also not be too filling. We checked on Yelp for lunch spots nearby and when Topo Gigio popped up, she endorsed it, as she had been there before. Off we went, ready for a cozy place with some delicious food. 

We were met at the entrance by a crisply-dressed host, who led us to our table. After perusing the menu, we both decided that the Tortellini soup sounded like the perfect lunch on this brisk day. Before it arrived, we enjoyed a selection of hot and fresh bread with some olive oil to keep our hunger at bay. 

When the soup arrived, I used some of the Parmesan cheese that the server had brought out with our bread basket and added a bit to the top of the soup. Once it melted a bit, it made the perfect peppy addition to the soup -- the proverbial cherry on top, if you will. We both devoured the soup, and at the end I even told my friend &quot;I could eat a whole pot of that soup!&quot; Something about the filling tortellini, the savory component to the broth, and the extra zest of the cheese on top hit the spot on that day. 

Our servers made sure to keep our water glasses filled, and didn&apos;t seem to mind that we only got a light lunch, still giving us attention and checking in if we needed anything. If you&apos;re looking for a quick lunch spot with delicious food and great service, Topo Gigio belongs at the top of your list!"
4,"My, gahd. Who&apos;s cooking my food back there?! 

I&apos;m not a huge pasta person, but I&apos;ll be one if we&apos;re going to Topo Gigio!

The Conchiglie Alla Sarda is absolutely the best way to go. It almost tastes like a blend of white and red paste. It quite honestly could be. I&apos;m still not even sure what I ordered, haha. Don&apos;t @ me, but I think the next time I come here, I&apos;ll have to ask for my pasta to be cooked a bit more. I like them borderline soggy, lol. 

Don&apos;t forget to order the grilled calamari. So worth it! It&apos;s basically an entree-sized snack. My boyfriend and I split the two. We were absolutely stuffed. Well, it&apos;s probably because we had bread too.

Definitely a fan but wouldn&apos;t murder for Topo Gigio."
5,"We had such a good meal at Topi Gigio! We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for somewhere to eat in Old Town on a Saturday. There was a 45 minute wait, but we got in within 25 min of putting our name in. 

We sat outside under a heat lamp, and it wasn&apos;t too chilly. The atmosphere was lively as expected. The service was fantastic as well!

There were three of us - two got the fusilli topo gigio, and another the spaghetti and meatballs. We would be happy to order the same thing over and over again!! There was plenty to take home for seconds as well. We were served complimentary bread and olive oil to start our meal, fresh out of the oven.

We were very satisfied with our meals!! I can&apos;t wait to come back and bring other friends!"
5,Best Italian place you will EVER eat at. Be sure to go on a weekend and order the fettuccine special! YUM!
5,"Authentic Italian with homemade pasta al dente.  
Definitely a restaurant to go back."
5,The ambience here was amaze. I don&apos;t think you can mess up pasta but topo Gigio&apos;s was outta this world!!!!. We started with burrata and each had a different dish. They were super flexible with my friend who was gluten free
5,"This is one of our favorite Italian places in the city. We&apos;ve never dined in, but when we order takeout they give us cute little side salads and crusty bread along with our pasta entrees. The pastas are phenomenal - my favorites are the Vic Damone, Conchiglie alla Sarda, and Fusilloni. SO good, and fast easy pick up to boot."
5,Amazing!!! The food was incredible!!!! The service was great!!! I will definitely be coming back.
5,"This place was amazing. The service, the ambiance and the food!!!! I got one of the pasta dishes, shown in the photos, it&apos;s one of the specialties. It was a huge portion with more than enough to take home. The waiter was amazing and knew everything about every kind of food and bottle of wine. The place is also a lot bigger than I thought! I will definitely be back!!!"
5,"Everything absolutely delicious!!! Sauces had the right consistency and flavor. Seafood all tasted fresh. Housemade fettuccine in lobster tomato sauce with seafood was a special which a shame because it can very easily be a go-to dish for me! Tiramisu was perfect finish.

1. Calamari alla Griglia - grilled calamari sauteed with lemon and wine sauce
2. Housemade fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, and clams in lobster tomato cream sauce
3. Conchiglie alla Sarda - seashell pasta in a tomato cream sauce with ground sausage, peas
4. Tiramisu

Portions very generous. Service was good."
