5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance.

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."

The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.

I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."

The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left.

We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.

My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive.

4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating.

The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"

4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat.

I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff.

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment.

They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful.

I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."

The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)!

Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in.

Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago.

The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable.

5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"

The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu.

For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."

Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."

Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take.

We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days.

Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow.

Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."

4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago.

3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."

He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though.

5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating.

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast.

So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff.

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment.

They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful.

I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."

The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)!

Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in.

Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago.

The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable.

5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"

The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine 

After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
1,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I&apos;ve lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I&apos;m sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn&apos;t receive).
For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
5,"These are the exact chicken &amp; waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I&apos;ve had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they&apos;re holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!

My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). 

I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don&apos;t even like sweet potato and I&apos;m obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend&apos;s place.

Highly highly recommend to all! I can&apos;t wait to return someday."
5,"Still open for takeout!

Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future."
5,"First restaurant/first time
Around Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy.  Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash.  The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"
2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy.  The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!

Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
4,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That&apos;s on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. 
Support Black Owned Businesses."
3,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look  amazing. 
I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn&apos;t like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.   On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it&apos;s been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. 
Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I&apos;ll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
4,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
5,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. 

I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our  dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It&apos;s worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we&apos;ll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. 

Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I&apos;m not done!&quot;"
5,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
4,"First of all, I&apos;m glad I read someone&apos;s post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. 

I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn&apos;t my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&amp;B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. 

Go with an appetite. Go and eat. 

Oh, they don&apos;t have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
4,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server&apos;s recommendation to have the week&apos;s special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.

My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.

Come hungry as the experience with be filling. I couldn&apos;t believe people were waiting in cars and socially distanced on sidewalk to dine as well as all the to-go orders. Actually I can, and wished Miami had Black-owned spot like this."
5,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. 

I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. 

It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn&apos;t have that inner sliminess that many places have. 

The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn&apos;t taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. 

The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
4,"B&amp;B still got it!! They&apos;re doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They&apos;ve distanced tables and they&apos;re using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
4,"It&apos;s important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year&apos;s Day. Huge thank you&apos;s to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter &amp; Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I&apos;m from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I didn&apos;t realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn&apos;t need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn&apos;t messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the &quot;cheese crusted hash browns&quot;. I definitely understand with delivery it&apos;s entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren&apos;t especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I&apos;ll definitely order again!"
5,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don&apos;t realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry&apos;s has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm. 

 After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup. 

 I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
5,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets!  Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. 
The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn&apos;t like French toast) loved it because it didn&apos;t taste egg at all!
Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
5,"I&apos;ve been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!

Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.

With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!

After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu.

For &quot;world famous French toast&quot; there sure isn&apos;t anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn&apos;t get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. 
It&apos;s not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
3,"1.5 hr wait.
40 min wait for food
Steak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.
Lemon French toast - cold
47 dollars for a cheap meal.
Not recommended."
4,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)

If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
