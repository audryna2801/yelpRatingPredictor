5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."

It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.

What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45.

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch.

3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill).

5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."

We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life.

4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then?

5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"

4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...

Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really.

The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45.

However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though

5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert).

3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."

We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me.

I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded.

The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get!

5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite.

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill).

What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."

After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."

Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well.

2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."

It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.

What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45.

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch.

3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill).

5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."

We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life.

4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then?

5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"

4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...

Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really.

The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45.

However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though

5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert).

3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."

We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me.

I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded.

The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get!

5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite.

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill).

What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."

After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."

Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well.

2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."

It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.

What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45.

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch.

3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill).

5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."

We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life.

4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then?

5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"

4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...

Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really.

The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45.

However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though

5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert).

3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."

We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me.

I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded.

The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get!

5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite.

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill).

What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."

After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."

Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well.

2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
If you visit the restroom, read the funny handwashing signs!"
5,I love the zoom dinners with the food to be cooked and a bottle of wine to be paired with the food. It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."

It&apos;s always a great menu that we get to cook with the chef on zoom and while we eat a coarse the wine is explained and a discussion of each dish. It&apos;s a learning experience and fun to follow the chat screen on zoom!
5,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. I recently ordered take out. Must gets: truffled garlic bread, mama depandi&apos;s bucatini, and crispy brussel sprouts. This is a higher end Italian restaurant so expect higher prices."
5,"Kevin and Mario were so nice!! amazing service!! kevin was very prompt and later in the evening when I wanted the name of a song, mario and kevin were very diligent in trying to find out the name of the song for me!! the food was great as well! i will be back!"
3,This is the second time that i chose RPM Italian and this is the second time that i have paid for a good amount of food and only receive side portions. The fact that the pasta is $18 and you only get like this small bowl of pasta... is absurd. I kid you not i didn&apos;t even take a bite out of it yet. But for $18...
4,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don&apos;t forget to make a reservation during COVID."
4,"I have not been here in years and I forgot how great the food is here.  I came for a birthday and we all ordered different things.  I am gluten free and they offer many of their pasta options to be made with gluten free noodles and I think thats great.  I initially thought I was going to get the pasta but I saw they had a mushroom risotto on the menu that night and sounded too good to pass up.  It was very good!  If you are gluten free I would ask if they have a risotto option of the menu that night, and if not I feel confident you would be very happy with the GF pasta options.  I asked our server what the most popular GF pasta they serve and he said it was the spicy king crab."
5,"Our Christmas Eve (7 fishes) dinner pick up was our first experience with RPM. I chose RPM Italian based on my friend&apos;s RPM Steak positive experience and the menu. 

The pick up process was very quick and easy. I pulled up in front and texted the number with name and car. They brought out our food within 5 minutes. 

I wasn&apos;t concerned about the temperature of the food since we weren&apos;t going to eat it right away. I could tell some of it was still warm. Once I unpacked the food, I realized they forgot a portion of one of the dinners - the octopus. Sadly, it turned out to be my daughter&apos;s favorite of the entire meal. It was very good. Well cooked and great flavor! I was initially concerned about the small portions, but since it was a multi-course, it actually filled us up. The beef fillet was very big. It was difficult to get it warm enough without turning it into well done. I knew it was properly cooked to medium before I got my hands on it. :) The worst part of carry out in general is not all food tastes as good as in-person dining. The squid ink pasta was delish. I will definitely want to order again. We thought everything was tasty and well cooked. 

Now, back to the octopus, I tried calling the restaurant once I noticed the octopus was missing. No one answered so I took a chance and texted the number for order pickup - someone responded. They apologized and offered to comp one of the meals, way beyond my expectation! I love excellent service!  I can&apos;t wait until restaurants open again for indoor dine-in, it is winter in Chicago after all. I will definitely return to RPM Italian! And I don&apos;t believe the 4% COVID surcharge is out of line. Restaurants and their employees are hurting! I love going out to eat and I want to see our restaurants survive so when the pandemic is over, I can eat at all of the amazing restaurants in our city!"
5,"Amazing service, great drinks and good food! Would for sure go again! We went for a birthday dinner, followed Covid rules too"
5,"What is there to say about this place that hasn&apos;t already been said? The food is phenomenal, the service isn&apos;t overbearing and they have a lot of protocols in place that are intended to keep patrons safe during the new COVID normal. 

Unfortunately, it&apos;s reservation only &amp; a deposit is required, and they are practicing social distancing when seating tables. 

Now to the food - my favorites are the lobster ravioli, the spicy king crab, and the truffle garlic bread. I went back twice in a week so needless to say, I&apos;m a fan. 

Look for the red shoe - it&apos;s an inside joke between the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants."
2,"Never thought the day would come that I&apos;d be rating this restaurant so low.. Last night was about my 8th time dining at RPM Italian. I&apos;ve been going since 2014. I&apos;ve taken several friends over the years, and it&apos;s been one of my favorite date night spots to go. Previously, I would have rated it 5 stars. Definitely not anymore with last night&apos;s experience. 
Our reservation was for 8:15. The hostess didn&apos;t even look at us for the first 5 minutes we stood there trying to check in. We finally sat down about 10 minutes later, and guys, they are NOT following the 6 feet rule. We were taken to a table, with a little wall separating us from another table, but the wall came up to my shoulders, and I was sitting about a foot away from the table next to me. If I can blow out a candle from where I&apos;m sitting to where you are, you are too close. We asked if we could close the wall (it was retractable) and the employee said, &quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe you&apos;re the first person to ask me this tonight. I would feel uncomfortable too.&quot;
Moving on to food: 
1) our first appetizer (king crab bruschetta) didn&apos;t come until 9:20. I was starving. 
2) I always order the carbonara, and the server didn&apos;t offer to mix up the egg yolk. This happened as I watched the table next to me get this done. Not a big deal, but I&apos;ve never not had them mix it up for me. 
3) The carbonara and the short rib pasta were both luke warm. 
4) The most disappointing part- the steak. My bf ordered medium rare plus. Attached is how the steak looked. It was basically medium well. We never send food back, but he couldn&apos;t eat it. So we asked our server if we could please get something a little less cooked, and she&apos;s like, oh, okay, did you mean medium rare then? My bf and I just looked at each other as if we didn&apos;t know what medium rare plus meant... but he just smiled and said, yes. The comment made us feel like we  made the mistake and didn&apos;t know how we actually liked our steak cooked. Eventually, the server came back and said, &quot;I asked a colleague how she thought this steak was cooked, and she confirmed that it looked medium well, so you were right, don&apos;t feel bad.&quot; Great, but the way this was initially handled was not well. And that comment insinuates that you did make us feel bad, because well, she did. 
Overall, horrible experience. From covid 19 precautions to the food, wow, just really unimpressed this time."
3,"I know 2020. has been a tough year for the restaurant business and that no one is happy. I really don&apos;t want to make it harder, but stuff at this place NEEDS A HUGE TRAINING on how to treat their customers from the  beginning until the very end. People don&apos;t come to your place just to eat, they come to have a good time and good experience overall. 
If you want to be on top of the game and restaurant at your level, you need to make sooo many changes.
I left better reviews on places with way lower food quality, just because I felt 10 times better and more welcomed.
I&apos;d like ti mention busser Aron that works really hard and does his best
RPM in Washington DC can teach you a lot on service and everything after all.
 
Food was nothing special 3.5/5"
4,"Year 2020 has been crazy and I can&apos;t believe this is my first Yelp review after months of quarantine life. 

We&apos;ve been only ordering takeouts since COVID and decided my birthday won&apos;t be an exception. RPM Italian has a decent takeout menu and we ordered meatball, octopus, meatball spaghetti, spicy king crab, brussels sprouts and garlic bread. We arrived several minutes earlier than our pickup time and the food was already ready for us. Food was warm when we got it but got cold shortly after we returned home (10 min drive). Overall, food was tasty and I bet they would taste even better when fresh. 

Hope the world rights itself soon and I miss the days we can dine out without catching a virus."
3,"We chose to dine here for our 9 year anniversary. I was really excited but the whole experience was honestly a letdown. 

I made a reservation for 8 pm, you have to put down a $50 deposit by the way. It goes towards your bill at the end though. Valet is $15. Upon checking in we were told our table was getting the check. After waiting 15 minutes we were finally seated, but not at a table that was previously seated. We were seated in the bar area, which not really ideal because you have direct view of the whole waiting area, but I was starving at this point and did not want to wait longer. I did see another couple get seated at the most cramped spot right next to the cash register, they asked if they could get another table and were told no. They eventually got fed up and left. 

I ordered the spritz and giggles drink, which I really liked. For apps we got the Caesar wedge salad, truffled garlic bread, 600 day aged prosciutto, and truffle beef tartare. 

Caesar wedge - delicious, refreshing and light
Truffled garlic bread - no truffle flavor at all, bread was hard, I ate one piece and that was it
Prosciutto - really good, chianti butter had some chunks of salt in it though 
Truffle beef tartare - my fav out of all the apps, you can taste the truffle on this one 

Service was kind of slow, which was weird because there were not many people seated in the bar dining area. Our waters got refilled often though. For our meal we got the lobster ravioli and spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti. The spicy crab spaghetti had good heat, it&apos;s def pretty spicy! The pasta was NOT al dente though, it was hard. The sauce had good flavor and the crab was good, but there wasn&apos;t much. 

Bill - they add a 4% COVID surcharge

Is it worth it in my opinion? Absolutely not. Will I come here again? Probably not, unless for drinks and apps."
5,"We had the entire inside of the restaurant to ourselves for a special dinner. Travis, our server, was solid and all other servers were attentive as well. Old Fashions were imbibed with recklessness. Just about every appetizer offered savored. The massive bone-in Rib eye was delicious and cooked to perfection, but it was the crispy Brussels sprouts that stole the show. Ended the evening with a Tartufo (my favorite Italian dessert). Good company made this meal special.
Best of all, we were taking this all in on the Saturday Joe Biden became President-elect Joe Biden and the entire downtown city of Chicago was in such high spirits, honking, whistling, and celebrating. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."
5,"The food here was really delicious!! Would&apos;ve liked if the portions were a bit bigger given the price but the pasta was so simple and fresh.

We ordered a few things and split them which was a good idea. The truffle pizzete was good too. 

Make sure you save room for dessert! The donuts are amazing!! 

The server we had was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a cute accent. Nice ambiance on the patio."
5,"Been meaning to update. Wife and I are pretty much lettuce entertain you restaurant exclusive. Although I give a 5 star perfect rating for our 6-7 other visits that were perfect. However having said that, last time in there this past Valentine&apos;s Day, they were out of the bone in rib-eye which honestly rivals any steakhouse in the city &amp; I&apos;ve been to just about all of them over the years. Disappointed in that because it&apos;s one of the main reasons I go there. Dropping the ball on that for sure &amp; waiter seem to rush us and overall wasn&apos;t a fan compared to each and every time there which have been perfect. This is as good as it gets people despite the one off."
5,"My husband and I came to visit here for a date night on Sunday night and had such a great time here! We originally had made our reservation for Saturday but something came up so we had to change it to Sunday. I&apos;m so glad they were flexible with moving the date for us because we had to put down a $50 deposit for the reservation. We both thought that was a high amount but we really wanted to try this place out so we did! 

We arrived early and checked-in with the host. She told us she had a nice booth for us inside which threw us off because our original reservation was for the patio. We thought something may have changed now that the reservation was for Sunday so we just grabbed the booth inside. I actually love booths and the inside decor and lighting of this restaurant is romantic so it was perfect for our date. 

Our server was incredible! She was so welcoming and professional. She asked us right away before we ordered anything if there were any dietary restrictions between us both. Loved that detail and it is so important. I ordered a Sauv Blanc and my husband got a beer. They brought it out quick and the RPM team was working quick and well together. They all had masks on and their sanitary practices were visible.

On to the food! We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and the Prime Rib Meatballs. Omg these both blew away our expectations. We expected 1/3 of the quantity served. The bread was half a french loaf and the meatballs were 4 large ones! The truffle garlic was mouth-watering and the meatballs were moist and fresh tasting. The garlic amount was strong -which we love, but if you don&apos;t be cautious! The fresh basil in the marinara served with the meatballs gave it that extra  touch. 

Next, we were getting full already so we split the Short Rib Bolognese. The rib meat was so perfectly cooked it hardly stayed on my fork. The sauced paired well and the pasta was cooked perfectly also. We were sad we were full at the end of the pasta because there is so much more we wanted to get! Until next time RPM and thank you for a special night!"
5,"My friends and I have been on a search for a delicious lobster ravioli that packed great flavor for a reasonable price. RPM did not disappoint. The spinach dough is stuffed with a delicate buttery mascarpone cheese and chunks of main lobster that satisfies every bite. The tomato basil sauce adds another level of flavor and you will want to take your truffled garlic bread and dip it. I&apos;m just saying. 

What&apos;s even more beautiful is that they deliver! My only tiny complaint is that it is such a small portion!"
3,"Celebrating our first anniversary as a married couple, my husband chose a place he is all too familiar with. We had reservations for 6:45($50 deposit to be applied to bill). Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. They do check your temperature, ask if you&apos;ve traveled recently to a list of states, and require mask while moving through the restaurant. What didn&apos;t quite sit with me well was how the woman who seated us said they would be needing the table back by 8:45. 

As for our waiter, and I&apos;m not sure if it was the language barrier, but he moved very quickly and rarely checked-in. 

I don&apos;t know, but from a 4-star restaurant I expected more. 

On a better note, I enjoyed every dish and drink ordered. My favorites were the salad, shrimp, bruschetta, and the ravioli. The squid ink pasta was a little undercooked, but still good. 

My husband mentioned they may have a new chef due to the portion changes in the food. While the ravioli was filled with more crab, the spicy king crab pasta was a smaller portion than he had when he last visited for his mom&apos;s birthday. 

I would have liked to try some dessert, but I was ready to go."
4,"This was my 3rd indoor meal since the pandemic, roughly. Due to an error at my party&apos;s job, she was rewarded some certificates from the restaurant.
We came in, our temperatures were taken and we sat. The place is very nicely decorated in off-white. They did very well with social distancing parties. Since this was a brunch at 1:30 we skipped wine with the meal and went with Arnold Palmers(iced tea and lemonade). Our waiter was friendly and informative. 

We started with Garlic Truffle bread and kale salad. Both were great! I got the salmon with pistachio pesto (many proteins are a la cart FYI) and my party got the spicy crab black spaghetti. I decided to save some salad for the salmon, and it took a while, but finally the entrees arrived. My salmon was moist, seasoned, sizeable and nicely cooked (sorry for the bad photo) but $29 and NO sides?? A little steep really. But I enjoyed it and asked for a box to take a little home, save room for dessert.
The spicy crab black pasta was awesome! Sorry no picture but it was beautiful! 
Dessert was great, the Amalfi lemon cake was a mix of lemon cream and cake, and the pistachio gelato with strawberries was good.
