5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives.

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."

We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"

The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer!

4,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t&apos;was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can&apos;t give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - &quot;OMG, is this the whole place!?!&quot;  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place&apos;s renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I&apos;ve ever seen!  No wonder there&apos;s a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that&apos;s it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that&apos;s clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don&apos;t know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."
5,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. 

Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn&apos;t have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 

First - the meat. Be warned that a &quot;single&quot; is actually a double here and a &quot;double&quot; is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn&apos;t messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I&apos;m a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
5,"Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks &amp; a round of shots was about $242 

I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 

You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don&apos;t like seeing the red in your meat 

Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..

I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald&apos;s 

They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code"
5,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It&apos;s always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it&apos;s pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I&apos;ve been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
1,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn&apos;t wait to try it. 
We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did.
We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. 
We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. 
Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn&apos;t it."
3,"We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 

Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli.

Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn&apos;t as good as it is for dine-in. I&apos;d recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
4,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. 

I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best burger I&apos;ve ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
5,"Holy. F**k. 

What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 

Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
5,"Probably my favorite burger I&apos;ve ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great

Food:
- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch

Drinks:
- House whiskey (4/5): can&apos;t go wrong with $3 whiskey!

I can&apos;t wait to go back here"
3,"Meh. 
Voted the best burger in town.
Mehhh. 

It was ok. 

Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 

We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 

Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 

That&apos;s a hard pass."
4,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away.

The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!

Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great.

Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty.

Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
4,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter.

Let&apos;s start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here&apos;s where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That&apos;s ok, because I like the salt.

And now the fry guy. If you don&apos;t already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries.

And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. 

Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you."
4,"There&apos;s nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!

The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you&apos;re my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn&apos;t get another bite in. 

Pro Tip: If you&apos;re eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don&apos;t give them out for free.

Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn&apos;t realize that napkins weren&apos;t standard. Smh"
4,Great veggie burger option. I&apos;m not one for veggie burgers but I crave this one often. Not vegan friendly :(
1,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane&apos;s Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago&apos;s current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane&apos;s Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that.

Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that &quot;we would have to eat elsewhere&quot;. He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us &quot;Are you done?&quot; in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn&apos;t as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers &amp; management can&apos;t be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
3,"It&apos;s alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that&apos;s it.  
Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
5,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated.

The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! 

The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!

A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!"
5,"Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it&apos;s literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 

We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. 

The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you&apos;re use to. It wasn&apos;t that sweet and as strong either. 

The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn&apos;t ask what temperature you&apos;d like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that&apos;s what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It&apos;s literally worth the hype! 

I&apos;d recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don&apos;t want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren&apos;t that busy around those times. 

They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
5,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
5,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me.

This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
