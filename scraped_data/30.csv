5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

5,"We enjoyed lunch here, on our first day visiting Chicago from Los Angeles.  We ate outside and the weather was just beautiful. Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS! 
Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.

4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!

Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."

Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS!

Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers.

4,"The place is not bad. I have observed it a couple of times and finally decided to check it out. The burger is really great, fries are also awesome, sandwich is okay. Probably will come later to give a more detailed review"
5,Excellent food and drinks on a busy day. Spiced cider was wonderful. The fish and chips and the ravioli is what we got and both were very delicious.
4,"Amazing gastropub with an awesome location. Love the indoor decor and ambiance. They have indoor, bar and outdoor seating available. Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Everything we ordered was really good..would recommend the regular burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and the ceviche. The Bloody Mary and Bellini were pretty good too. Prices of most items were reasonable. Overall good experience, would recommend coming here."
5,"I came here under the pretext that they had a varied menu - which they do - but it was really because I was in the mood for brunch. I didn&apos;t realize it was Restaurant Week, and they had a meal with a drink and two generous menu items for $24. 

I started with the Bloody Caesar, a Bloody Mary with horseradish. It&apos;s a nice twist. I followed that  with a Scotch duck egg: huge and flavorful, and not at all greasy despite being deep fried. There was a small amount of a tasty mustard aioli...not enough for the huge egg. The ham and eggs were very good, but there were utterly bland baked beans underneath. 

My wife&apos;s mom took a sweeter approach. She got a drink called Breakfast of Champions: iced espresso, cognac, horchata, cream, and...cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon toast crunch! It almost needed a spoon, like a bowl of cereal. Then, she got the most amazing banana bread: moist, banana-y, with a cream cheese sauce. There&apos;s way too much for one person (fortunately, she shared).

My son got one of the tastiest burgers I&apos;ve ever had: nicely charred and an explosion of beef. Sorry, cow! So good it didn&apos;t need anything on it.

And, the home fries were so tasty they didn&apos;t need the cheese. Of course, I ate the cheese. 

The service was also top notch and friendly. One of us had an issue with one of the menu items, and they happily replaced it and comped the item. 

In a city of phenomenal dining options, I wanted to come back here again for dinner. Or, maybe just eat my brunch extra slowly until dinner comes around. Looks like I have a plan for next time I&apos;m in town."
4,"Let&apos;s talk about the food in a minute and talk more about the AMAZING service here. I&apos;m horrible with names but our host and waiter for the night were some of the sweetest people I&apos;ve met so far. They were very patient and down to earth. It definitely made my first experience there a lot better. 

In terms of the food/drinks:

* would go back for the drinks - tasted fresh and boujee 
* Cheese board was mediocre, maybe cause I&apos;ve had many cheese boards in the past. Wish there was some type of meat or fruit on it. 
* Ice cream was smooth and very rich -- would highly recommend the chocolate or spice. The vanilla had some crystallization near the bottom 

All this was about $30/person so not too bad for a pretty upscale place."
4,"Came here with some co-workers for lunch during restaurant week.  When I walked in I was a little surprised at how fancy it was!

I got the 3 course lunch menu.  We had our choice of a potato soup, a scotch egg, or a whitefish rillete.  I went with the rillete, but also tried the scotch egg that a coworker got.  The rillete was ok, a little dry and not super tasty.  I liked the scotch egg a little more.  The egg was hard boiled and I prefer soft boiled but was huge and had a really nice mustard flavor which I liked.  For the entree, I got the gumbo.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  They only served 2 shrimp in there, but I liked the flavor and the sausage in there.  For dessert, I got the cookies and candies.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was really good.  Everyone else got the huckleberry tart which was good, just pretty hard which made it hard to cut.

Overall, cool vibe and some good options mixed with subpar ones.  It&apos;s definitely worth a try.

5,"We enjoyed lunch here, on our first day visiting Chicago from Los Angeles.  We ate outside and the weather was just beautiful. Our server Rosie was very friendly and provided excellent customer service with a smile  All of  food was delicious.   My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he said it was delicious.  My &apos;Classic Burger&quot; was also extremely tasty. We decided to spluge on dessert and shared a piece of lemon  cheesecake.  It was scrumptious."
5,OMG. best buffalo cauliflower app EVER. Split the Smoke salmon BLT. So good. Great service. Beautiful day to visit downtown Chicago. If you are in the city give them a try you won&apos;t be sorry. Tell Jerald we said HI!
5,"This was truly an amazing spot. Not being from Chicago, I was looking for a gastro pub for a good burger and beer. We ended up with wine instead, but that was of choice; not selection. Reservations are required. Seating is both indoor and outdoor. Jamal was our server &amp; was SUPER friendly and professional. He was very responsive as well. Totally recommend his as a server. We ordered the king salmon and venison burger. Beautiful presentation and tasted amazing."
4,"I was prepared to dislike this place because it was on the Mag mile thining it would cater to tourists and be &apos;kitchy&apos;.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised because the ambiance is so both cool and cozy.  It felt like there were people from all walks of life and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

Their beer/wine/cocktail list is pretty extensive and can see this place being a good place for a happy hour or cocktails date.  They also have delicious mocktails for anyone expecting!  I had a cinnamon/cranberry mocktail that was so delicious I kept forgetting it was a mocktail.

Food-
We had the fried pickles and the burger.  Both were delicious.  The burger was moist and the bread was pretty good too.  The fried pickles were a surprisingly large portion, and the sauce complimented the tartness of the pickles deliciously."
5,"Amazing food and service. I believe our server&apos;s name was Wes. He was super attentive from the get-go. 
I got the Steak Frites while both my husband and father in law got the Lobster Roll. For dessert we got the cheesecake and cobbler.
Everything was DELICIOUS! 
Father in law claims it was the best sandwich he&apos;s had in his life and he&apos;s 70 so that&apos;s saying something.
Unfortunately we&apos;re only in Chicago for a day so we can&apos;t go back for more, but if you&apos;re reading this and wondering if you should give it a try - Do it !!"
5,"It is Chicago, in the dead cold of winter and COVID fury but The Gage manages to  elevate the outdoor dining experience with some socially distanced tables under sturdy heated tents. My family of 3 had Sunday brunch there and it was superb.
The staff was attentive at a distance, and managed to keep my coffee hot throughout; no small feat in 30 degree weather just inches away. But first, the bad parts: it&apos;s a heated tent but we still felt like we needed our coats on although, admittedly other were without.  Possibly attributed to Floridians needing sometime to acclimate. Certainly beyond management control. The coffee while kept hot, was kind of standard; my guess would be Folgers. Overall, not a whole lot of risks on the menu, but what is lost in depth is gained in width; venison, lasagna, pork, pizza, and surely delicious bass as well as a diverse brunch menu on the weekend; (call first but I think this is available Saturday as well.)
The good stuff; I have the Banana Brul√© pancakes, which were very flavorful and cooked to perfection as was my side of bacon. The pancakes were fluffy but substantive and the cream sauce, a perfect complement to the bananas within and sliced atop. 
My wife went with the corn beef hash which had poached eggs on it and yes, I had more than a forkful of her&apos;s as well. The dish was very tasty but the mystery is how anyone on this planet has ever made cubed corned beef &apos;fluffy&apos;.  I mean, I&apos;ve had melt in your mouth corned beef before but this is a whole new level.
Still, my adult daughter, being vegan, presents almost any Chicago kitchen a unique challenge. Here is where our waiter&apos;s skill (Ash) really shone.
While Buffalo cauliflower was discussed, he steered her towards the chips vindaloo; steak fries with an Indian curry sauce which she enjoyed immensely. And the step above was also making an avocado toast for her that was not on the menu.
For the three days we were in Chicago, granted the only &apos;dine-in-tent&apos; experience, it was by far the best meal we had based on the food alone."
5,"My group of six came here on a Wednesday night before going ice-skating. They have a really nice enclosed patio for Covid where everyone is spread out, and it is not too cold. I was able to take my jacket off all the others in my party did as well. 

The service was really good, and the waiter came back multiple times when we were not ready to place our order. The cocktails were a little expensive but really tasty and this place as a good craft beer menu. Our meals came out relatively quickly and everyone in my party gave the thumbs up on the food.

I had the apple salad with Amish chicken added, and it was very good. I really liked the addition of the Amish chicken -  it was very flavorful. I also heard that venison burger was great, and I had a bite of the pizza which was delicious as well. 

All in all, I had a really good meal, was warm, and surrounded by good company so I will definitely return here in the future!"
5,"On vacation... during the pandemic. Everything is closed. Thank God this place is opened. The Gage is a MUST!!  The service, the food and the ambiance is totally worth  it."
4,"I visited this spot after an afternoon date that spilled over into the evening. It&apos;s, obviously, incredibly convenient being right off of Michigan. As this was during COVID we were outside in one of their heated tents which was very comfortable. 

The pizza was good and the Apple salad was up-to-par, as well. While I think their more famous dishes are probably significantly better, I was not willing to pay what they were asking for them. Location, as should be expected, was factored into their prices. 

Overall, it&apos;s a great restaurant but it is best suited for those who really want the location and are willing to pay for it. The inside is beautiful, but, unfortunately, closed now due to COVID. I would happily recommend this restaurant to a friend if they were willing to shell out for one of their more expensive entree&apos;s."
5,"Love the Gage for a predictably good meal any time of day - been for lunch pre covid and got the best salad ever!!  Went last night for dinner in their covered patio which kept us very warm despite being a chilly winter night. We loved the experience top to bottom. Salmon BLT for me and fish and chips for him. We went in! Both delish! Shared the Buffalo cauliflower and loved the amount of spice, just right. This is a great place on Michigan Ave if you are in the hood. Noticed the prices rose a tad but hey, tough times. We get it."
5,"I got &quot;fish and chips&quot; and &quot;Mint Dark Chocolate Mousse&quot;. Everything was absolutely delicious. From the cod fish itself, light fried batter, the house made tartar sauce, and seasoned crispy soft fries - everything was made right. If you have a sweet tooth, the mint dark chocolate mousse will not disappoint. Every component is high quality.

Service was good. I don&apos;t often come to downtown but I will immediately remember this place when I am near the Art Institute."
5,"We just happened by, asked to be seated outdoors- and were seated along Michigan Ave..The tables were on the sidewalk, but off the beaten path, and lovely on an early fall day-
Our server suggested the fish and chips (lunch) and it was perfect- my wife had a salad that she enjoyed- we split a flight of beer- that was also very good and suggested by our server.
This is a first class place- service and food were outstanding.

The men&apos;s room was so cool looking I took a picture!"
4,"I ate here - twice - during a one week visit to Chicago before the pandemic, so I can&apos;t speak to their current service/cleanliness levels. Beforehand, though - it was definitely worth my time - on both visits!

The service was great - polite, friendly and prompt (without being pushy). The food was delicious. I love that they had hay straws to avoid plastic (hopefully they still do!) The place is great for a romantic date, a night out with friends or just going solo."
4,"The Gage is a wonderful place to have a great drink and a meal and just sit and hang for a while. Service was excellent and friendly, food was very good. Fish fry was the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. Not said lightly. I cook it often myself, and order it wherever I go. Amazingly crispy coating. I really enjoyed the burger, and Tresa loved it. Accompanying asparagus was really done well! 

My 4stars is many people&apos;s 5. I&apos;ll definitely continue to go back."
