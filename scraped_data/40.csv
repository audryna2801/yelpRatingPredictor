5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."

Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."

5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"

5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."

The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"

Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!

The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust.

Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.

I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"

A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?

Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"

I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
5,"Dine in just opened and my family and I couldn&apos;t be happier! We have come many times pre-COVID and waited hours to be seated (which has always been well worth it). However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11.

However, now during COVID, they are doing dine in and requiring reservations which is an even better scenario than before. The food tonight was better tonight than I remember! The Mediterranean bread is so flavorful and unique and the bread just melts in your mouth. We all got individual 1/2 pound pot pies with the meat sauce which is the perfect blend of sauce, cheese, and bread that&apos;ll have you licking your plate!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down. My mom has been going here since she was 16 and got me hooked when I was about the same age! Before COVID, the wait was hours long because it&apos;s so small and so worth the wait. I&apos;m so happy that business has exploded the way it has for them over the years.

Pandemic or not, they offer frozen pizza pot pies to go that you can bake at home and absolutely nothing is compromised. It&apos;s exactly what you want when you think of a pizza pot pie. I&apos;ve never strayed too far from the pot pies, although friends have raved about their grinders as well. My go to order is a 1/2 pound meat sauce pie with mushrooms and order of Mediterranean bread on white. I do often find myself dreaming about the sour cream garlic dressing. 

A not so hidden gem in Lincoln park! Check it out and make sure you bring cash as they do not accept cards!"
4,"My boyfriends family is obsessed with this place! I do enjoy it as well, it&apos;s definitely on the heavy side, the 1/2 pounder will fill you up for half the week and the 1 pounder will be good for the whole week lol but in all seriousness, it&apos;s good food, the meat they use can be improved, it taste like cheap ground meat. 

Give it a try, now is the time otherwise you can expect 3+ hour wait times pre-Covid."
2,"Pre-pandemic.  A long queue formed before opening.  By the time the doors opened, the queue must have been more than 70 people deep.  This place is unbelievably popular.

My waitress is young but smooth and confident beyond her years.  She&apos;s knowledgeable about the food and silver tongued in her recommendations.  She has skills that would be the envy of a Nigerian prince.

Mediterranean Bread.  She places it on the table.  About 6 inches of  bread overhangs the entire perimeter of the plate and drapes the table like a place mat.  I&apos;m not a germaphobe but I have zero confidence the bus boy used a clean wash cloth with clean water and detergent to wipe the table top clean enough to eat off.  Boogers? Bacteria? Viruses?  A  pan sized for an extra large pizza will do nicely to allay concerns. The bread is chewy and a little heavy handed with Parmesan.  I understand the appeal and novelty but my preference would be for roti any day.

Meat Pizza Pot Pie.  The meet sauce is bland and watery and has a rough texture.  No depth, no richness, no zing.  Does the chef taste the sauce and adjust?  The whole mushrooms are heated through to what seems like about 100 degrees  and retain much of their rawness and crunch.  There is no synergy between the chewy cheese cap, sauce, and crust. The whole is not greater than the sum of the parts.  The pie did not equal the hype."
5,"There is pizza and there is pizza pies from Chicago pizza and oven grinder. Get ready for a truly amazing treat when you come here to pick up these bad boys.  


Im not actually missing the waiting three hours to get in to Chicago pizza and oven grinder.  Their curbside pick up system has been very smooth. It&apos;s cash only so that&apos;s just something you should be aware of... but it&apos;s really a good system.

Before you jump into your pizza choices don&apos;t forget to staples - their salad w both dressing - yes that right get both and mix them... and you have to have their MEDITERRANEAN BREAD!!! So amazing and would says  they are must haves.

Now their pizza pies are fantastic Togo. You can go with anything you wish for us it the vegetarian pie... the sauce is thick and hearty and oh so
Satisfying yum factor. It&apos;s loaded with cheese and the crust is in the OMG level ....  I was just portal launches to the 11+ zone ! 

Gotta go here if you haven&apos;t enjoyed there amazing food."
4,"(Pre-pandemic) Great food but wait time to get seated even on a weekday evening can be horrendous. Most tables are limited to only 6 thin individuals or 4 overweight individuals.

(Post-pandemic) Get carry-out!!!

***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH

Food:
Quality ingredients, freshly made that you can see, smell and taste
Pot pie pizza, meat - 4/5 - loaded with meat, tomato sauce, cheese in a soft dough pie... I would prefer a more crispy outer pie shell
Meatball oven grinder - 3/5 - not impressed at all by the taste
Mediterranean flatbread - 4/5 - beautiful rustic look and unique taste, but why such huge portions?
Salad - 5/5 - arranged nicely with dressing that complements well

Service:
A+ because our waitress knew all the right things to say at all the right moments; friendly and patient

Ambience:
Rustic tavern feel. Dim lit."
5,"First day open for dine-in since COVID shutdowns. Operating at 25% capacity, staff aware of safety precautions and guest directed to wear mask while not eating, guest were compliant. . We LITERALLY took a flight from LV just to come eat here !! The pizza pot pie does not disappoint, picture of  is the waitress flipping it over, cheese oozes everywhere ( but don&apos;t worry it is not over cheesey) The poppyseed dressing is to DIE FOR (brown one). The Mediterranean bread looks delicious but with 2 of us we would not have enough room in the tumtum.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian grinder and leftovers  it were even better as a late night snack. Between the food and the top notch service this place is in my top 5 EASY. Reservations HIGHLY recommended and they only take cash."
5,"Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder has been on my bucket list since I saw the many videos about their Pizza Pot Pies. They looked amazing and they did not disappoint! I ordered a 1/2 lb meat pizza pot pie and the Mediterranean bread online for curbside pickup. I arrived a person came out to greet me and I didn&apos;t even have to call. He showed me the receipt and I paid in cash. This place is CASH ONLY. 

The 1/2 lb pizza pot pie was very filling as it&apos;s loaded with cheese, sausage, big mushrooms, and lots of sauce. The dough was so soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were huge and fresh. There was so much cheese and it was very tasty! The meat sauce was the weak link, but good. Everything was excellent and it traveled insanely well. This was probably one of the best carryout meals I&apos;ve had during the pandemic. The Mediterranean bread was similar to Naan and it had a ton of flavor due to the spices and garlic that was on it. It was a massive portion for $11. 

Overall, the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was amazing. During normal times, wait times during peak times can be 2+ hours. I wouldn&apos;t want to do that wait normally unless a friend or family member wanted to try it for the first time. But it is definitely worth trying someday!"
5,"Amazing Mediterranean bread ! A must try!! 
Great salads and amazing pizza!! 
Cash only spot but definetly worth it!"
5,"Was finally able to try them via takeout. Surprisingly, it still held up well and was delicious. We had the 1/2 lb veggie and 1/2 lb regular sausage one, along with the Mediterranean bread. The crust was very nice and everything was perfectly flavorful that worked well together."
2,"Really unimpressed.

First, cash only in a pandemic.  Hate this. 
Second, total was 80.18, doing pick up, gave the guy $100, he brought back $19 and then acted confused when I took it and was looking for the change.  I think he thought I was going to tip him the whole amount?  I normally tip but did not after he shorted me.
Third, ordered for 730, didn&apos;t come out till 738. 
Fourth, the food was extremely disappointing.  Fast food is better.

Mediterranean Bread, White - needed a sauce or cheese or something.  It was just salty soft pita consistency, pretty big but hard to share without tearing.  A sauce would have really helped.  Or if it had been precut. Reminded me of Little Caesars.  Undercook pizza dough and through loose parmesan on it without any way to get it to stick.

The One-Pounder Meat Sauce (pork sausage), White Crust - Mushroom was whole and very unweildy and extremely unevenly cooked, the dough just seemed very undercooked, the cheese and meat was okay, sauce was good.   But again, not enough sauce.  Very hard to share, again.  Needed herbs for sure, was just a cheese bomb.  Totally not worth $30, though.

Italian Salami sandwich- near zero sauce, kind of bland, bread was mushy or fully cooked,  the salami seemed store bought and boring, peppers were served separate and we&apos;re plentiful, the toppers on the bread were good.  Not worth $16, even though it was largish.  Took a few bites before I had to find something to fix it.

Sausage sandwich- better sandwich in my mind, but the person who got it did not like it and didn&apos;t finish 1/4th of it.  Sauce was more plentiful and better, sausage was good, but didn&apos;t have the cheese volume of the other one.  Best of the sandwich but was least popular.

The sandwiches at quiznos were better.  Not happy.

Skip it, there are way better places in Chicago area."
5,Holy moly what a delicious Chicago destination!! Never had anything like it before and can&apos;t stop thinking about it since. Service was great especially during a pandemic. Love the to go options. The pizza is just as tasty the next day fir breakfast!!
5,"The staff was incredibly courteous. The ingredients were so fresh and well paired. I can&apos;t wait to come back! It&apos;s definitely worth the wait!
PLEASE NOTE:  They only accept cash payment.  It was a bumber"
5,"We&apos;ve waited many times for 3+ hrs to have lunch/dinner here and it is always worth it! The staff is always delightful, I love the owner! - and the food is incredible! I will always recommend this to friends and family as a must try.
Also, read the history in the back of the menu. Very interesting!"
4,"Fantastic and once again FANTASTIC pizza. My friend recommended the place and it did not disappoint. It&apos;s made upside down, so the crust becomes a bowl of sorts to hold the ingredients.  Get the meatless pizza, it tastes much better.  Oh, did I mention the delicious Mediterranean bread and salad with creamy garlic dressing?  All three make an extraordinary meal, not cheap, but memorable!"
5,"I have been here a handful of times and it&apos;s always awesome! This most recent time was during the quarantine and they are doing takeout.
We ordered three pot pies (or as we like to call them, pizza in a bowl) and two Mediterranean breads. Two pizza pot pies were meat with mushrooms and one was no meat. The mushrooms are huge! The sauce is reminiscent of a spaghetti sauce. The bread is a flat bread with yummy spices. All of these travelled well and reheats well, as well. They also offer the pot pies frozen. 
The have salads and grinders which all look so yummy!"
5,"Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the food to the service everything was great. Salads and dressings are amazing. Bring cash, they have an atm"
5,"They are open just for take out, I was hesitating about getting pot pie for carry out, but it definitely worth it, just preheat the oven and leave it in there for about 10 minutes.. so so good, really cheese, and the sauce pretty tasty! It&apos;s a must when in Chicago"
5,"Takeout only during COVID, but still delicious. The pizza pot pie is packed with delicious flavors, and is my top choice of the Chicago pizza options - definitely a better option than the deep dish spots. The salad (&amp; in particular, the dressing) are also incredible.

Only down side is with take out only, they&apos;re serving in a plastic takeout container so the crust gets soggy by the time you eat it. I don&apos;t think they could do it in a box though as it would fall apart, so they&apos;re definitely in a tough spot to get the quality the same with takeout. Still delicious and definitely still recommend! Cash only, so make sure you&apos;ve got $$."
5,"I&apos;m so glad they are still doing carry out during covid!  We have been wanting to try this place for months and finally ordered for take out!

Food: We got the Mediterranean bread, the pizza pot pie, and the meatball oven grinder.  The pizza pot pie was hands down our favorite!  It was out of this world delicious we wish we ordered more for leftovers.  The mediterranean bread was also phenomenal and I would order that again.  The portion of the meatball oven grinder was huge!  It was yummy but the other food stood out more than the oven grinder

Carry out:  picking up our food was a little chaotic because it was raining but the staff members did a great job of trying to get us out of their quickly with our food."
