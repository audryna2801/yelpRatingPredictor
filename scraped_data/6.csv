5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."

5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!

5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be.

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"

Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine!

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good).

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy.

Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine!

If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."

I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.

5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli.

-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!

5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be.

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."

I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS.

5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread.

5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."

My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!

5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be.

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"

Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine!

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good).

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy.

Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine!

If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."

I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.

5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli.

-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!

5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be.

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."

I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS.

5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread.

5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."

My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!

5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be.

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"

Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine!

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good).

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy.

Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine!

If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."

I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.

5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli.

-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!

5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be.

5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."

I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS.

5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. 

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."

I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 

No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!"
5,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine&apos;s Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
4,"We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I&apos;d never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  

Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It&apos;s VERY tasty!  

All the food we had was great!!  The ONLY thing that could improve the experience was if there was a location closer to me or a better parking situation.  That&apos;s not their fault though, just my own thing. :-P 

Excellent service, sangria is wonderful, and I heard happy hour is still going strong even during COVID (when indoor dining is available).  Looking forward to another visit when LEY week is going again!"
4,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.

The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. 

I didn&apos;t get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!"
5,"Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:

Bacon wrapped dates - I&apos;m not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!

Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection.

Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.

The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
5,"I have a weakness for all things Spanish. The tapas here are no exception. Honestly, I would eat here everyday if I could."
5,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can&apos;t say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. 

Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
5,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you&apos;re on the fence about coming here, don&apos;t be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. 

I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I&apos;d suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
5,"Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 

First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. 

Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 

We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can&apos;t wait until I can go back."
5,This is my go to place when I have friends in town or whenever me and my friends want tapas. You can truly order a bunch of tapas and still not pay a high price. The variety of tapas is great! Their sangrias are also awesome. Staff is always friendly.
5,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
5,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food.

We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn&apos;t sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn&apos;t remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
4,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that &quot;wowed&quot; us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were &quot;just good&quot; were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
5,"Always a Go to place for guaranteed delicious food. I was very impressed by all their safety measures- restaurant was busy as usual but followed safe social distance between tables, temp check before entering, etc. 

Highlight dishes- the fish/cod croquette, the small croquette ball was perfectly fried, the tarter sauce that accompanied the fried ball was delicious! One small croquette per order- I could&apos;ve gotten 5 more for myself because it&apos;s that good! 

Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, great as usual! You also can never go wrong with any of their paella choices. 

Really appreciate the staff for being opened and serving delicious food!"
5,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon &amp; apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
5,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. 

I&apos;ve dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
Very cool ambiance. 

Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it&apos;ll work too."
5,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious.

Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great.

Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What&apos;s different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
5,"-Great Spanish Tapas!
-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!
-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people.
-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!"
5,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn&apos;t think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion 
 but they were good, just didn&apos;t leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
5,"Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you&apos;ll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 

I&apos;ll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their &quot;spanish&quot; food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he&apos;s wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_

I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I&apos;m a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it&apos;s wat beneath my feet. 

Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I&apos;m a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
5,"Tasty tasty.

Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don&apos;t regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 

I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. 

For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato &amp; Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalape√±o Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. 

I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering.
