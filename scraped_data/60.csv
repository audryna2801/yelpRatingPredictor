5,Love this place! Cute charm and the staff is always so great! Food is amazing. Try the chocolate cream pie!
4,"I got the Spicy Pork Rigatoni carry out. It was solid for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a 5 star pasta. 

When I went inside to get my order, the ambiance and decor seemed excellent. I suspect that this would be an incredible place to spend a night with friends.

I have no doubt that Gilt Bar could be a 5 star restaurant, but for me, I had a 4 star carry out experience."
5,Dinner here was amazing. The meatballs were definitely the highlight of the night--they are without a doubt the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. The toased garlic bread that came with the meatballs was equally delicious. The dining room is very low-lit and cultivates a really nice date vibe. There&apos;s also a photobooth in the basement which is fun! Gilt Bar is simply the perfect place for a dinner date.
5,"Of my 600+ Yelp reviews, I&apos;m going to guess at least 100 are for restaurants. Of those 100 restaurants, NOTHING compares to the Gilt Bar, and the Library downstairs, in terms of service!! I was blown away tonight, my first visit to the Gilt and the Library (the &apos;secret&apos; speakeasy located under the Gilt.) 

Other Yelpers have praised the delicious food, hearty cocktails, fabulous ambiance, and rich decor. All amazing. But what truly stood out tonight was the exceptional service from the hostesses, wait staff, bus staff, and bartenders. 

Tonight I celebrated a very special health-related occasion, my one-year anniversary of being cancer free. 3 staff members congratulated me! The waitress surprised me with a sparkler in my ice cream!!  And we were given a table in the library for cocktails after our meal. It was perfect. 

Oh, my friend forgot his left-overs upstairs in the Gilt Bar and when he went back to look for them, the to-go bag was gone. He was bummed but just shrugged it off, but then as we were leaving the Library after a round of cocktails, the waitress showed up at our table with a to-go bag. With a whole new order!! For free!! The chef made a whole new pasta dish and packaged it up to go!! That&apos;s incredible service!! Above and beyond. I can see why The Gilt and The Library are a hot ticket in Chicago. 

I can not wait to go back! Be sure to book in advance!! This is a super popular spot!!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe this place was so busy on a Tuesday night! We came in around 7 and were told it&apos;d be an hour long wait. Luckily, we were able to snag some couch seats in the bar area so we didn&apos;t have to wait that long. Because it was so busy though, our service took longer and was difficult to get ahold of. 

The table red wine was delicious and a great price surprisingly, so I had two glasses with my meal. I also had to try the famous cheeseburger, and was thoroughly impressed. It was huge, but I finished it because it was so deliciously tasty and tender! Definitely one of the top burgers I&apos;ve had in Chicago.

I love the atmosphere of this place and have still yet to try out the speakeasy. I also love the prices- I am definitely going to be coming back soon for this sexy restaurant atmosphere with amazing food!"
5,"Came here last Wednesday with a couple friends and really enjoyed it. I&apos;m a hogsalt truther (hogsalt does au cheval, bavette&apos;s, gilt bar, etc), so take my review with a grain of salt, but I definitely recommend checking this place out.

We started with the burrata, which was a good, smallish starter for the 4 of us.  The tomatoes were roasted really nicely and had a sweetness to them that I really enjoyed it. 

I ended up getting the orecchiette with spicy sausage for my main.  My girlfriend got the salmon.  The sausage was really good, and the orecchiette was cooked perfectly.  If I were to go again, I would probably try the truffle pasta, I saw it on another table and it looked really good. My girlfriend liked the salmon, it was cooked really well.  She said she would probably try something else next time, but we both really enjoyed our food.

I will say that I enjoy au cheval and bavette&apos;s a little more than gilt bar, but the fact that it&apos;s close is impressive.

Overall - 8.2/10, food is flavorful, service is awesome, and vibe is dark/romantic"
5,"Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a great place to celebrate. We had a reservation and were seated downstairs in the smaller and much quieter library portion, which we enjoyed. We were treated with a free champagne toast to start our meal since we were celebrating which was a great touch!

We started with the burrata which was very creamy and delicious, with good toast and roasted tomatoes. One of our favorite parts of the meal for sure.

We then shared two pastas, the truffle and the waiter recommended orecchiette. Both were awesome, the truffle pasta was nicely balanced and not overpowering with truffle, and the orecchiette was very tasty with a good kick to the sausage but not enough to make someone spice intolerant sweat.

We finished with the burger which I am told is almost the same as Au cheval but I haven&apos;t been there. It was a very good burger with thick bacon and juice running out with every bite. The fries are served with the same garlic aioli that they serve at small cheval which we also love.

Finished with the chocolate cream pie which exceeded my expectations, the Oreo crust and whipped cream definitely make the dish. 

Along they way we tried several drinks, including a well made bourbon Manhattan, a fantastic whiskey sour, and the French martini. 

Basically, everything we ordered was very good and we had a great experience. Would recommend to anybody."
5,"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city and definitely one of the first places I make a resie if a friend is in town visiting. I love that there&apos;s a separate vegetarian menu with tons of delicious options! The restaurant itself is dark and has a bit of an intimate and romantic feel. But, don&apos;t think that it isn&apos;t a great spot for a girls night, too! 

Their vodka sauce rigatoni and truffle bucatini are my absolute favorite pastas on the menu. The pastas are all shareable so get a few for the table to try different dishes. As an app, definitely get the roasted garlic in balsamic. It is served with some bread and is SO simple yet SO delicious!! I also love how robust their drink menu is - tons of options for old fashioned, martinis, etc. I still just get the dirty martini, but they do it so well. 

Overall, I love this place and will keep coming back! I highly recommend it - whether it&apos;s for a date night, girls night, or whatever occasion."
5,"Mmmm mmm! This place was recommended by a friend and I&apos;m glad I went!
I like that you can order a whole or half for the pasta....so you can leave room in your tummy for more food.
They also have another restaurant/bar/speakeasy downstairs. It&apos;s behind a hidden door. I recommend if you want some good Italian food."
5,"Returned here with my boyfriend when he came into town this past weekend. I was so impressed with how the staff handled our reservations. There was some stress as we had originally made a reso for Friday night and then when his flight was canceled for the crazy Chicago storms, we had to cancel. The only available reso for Saturday was 6 PM and his new flight came in 5:20 PM Saturday. The woman who was directing the main line worked with me/stayed in touch to help ensure we would still be seated at one of our favorite restaurants. When we arrived close to 7, she seated us almost immediately. 

We were taken care of SO well and had our favorite- the bone marrow for appetizer, a dark &amp; stormy for me (Mule), an Old Fashioned for him, some delicious pasta, salmon, and another drink (on the house!). We were exceptionally pleased with how well we were treated, especially as it had been a very long week for both of us and we just wanted to relax &amp; decompress together.

All in all, the evening could not have been more lovely. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, the staff was attentive to our needs, and the ambiance/environment is second to none. Definitely come here if you need a romantic/softly lit/delicious restaurant for a date night."
5,"I like to get steak tartar whenever I see it on a menu (including Paris) and this is my favorite one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a huge serving, the egg is perfect, the bread is delicious. Must try!!"
4,"We came to Gilt Bar on a recommendation from a Chicago native - this is definitely a spot worth visiting!

The hostess seated us promptly for our 7:30 Friday reservation, which is easier said then done for many places. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I had a rye old fashioned to start, which was well-made and just what you expect from a cocktail bar. For food, I ended up going with the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Truffle Pasta. While my dish was very good, I had major food envy with the Truffle Pasta - the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the truffle was delicious. We saved some room for dessert and got the skillet cookie &amp; ice cream, which was more than enough for two people and provided a satisfying end to the meal.

The only downside to Gilt Bar was that we felt the lighting was too dim - I get trying to set a mood, but we had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu, even after our eyes adjusted. This was our only minor quibble with an otherwise great experience."
5,"Yes! This place is so good. 

The short: expansive drink menu, reasonably priced delicious food, sultry ambiance and good service. 

The long: Came here with a group of four friends and had a great experience from start to finish. We had a Friday 8pm reservation and were seated at a window seat immediately. Our waitress quickly came over with our drink menus which I always appreciate. I ordered the Spanish Old Fashioned which was really nice. It had a slight twist but was not too out of the ordinary. 

For appetizers we ordered the garlic, salmon cesar salad and the beef tartar. The salmon salad was delicious and I loved how you could order half portions of all the salads. The garlic oil and bread was good however I wish there was a greater clove to oil ratio. I did not try the tartar but the table loved it. 

For dinner we split the orecchiette and the truffle pasta. They were both super flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend both of these dishes. They are portioned very nice to split. We had also ordered the mashed potatoes but our waitress forget to bring them to the table which was fine with me since I was pleasantly full. 

Overall, Gilt bar is a wonderful place to share a couple of dishes with good friends. I would definitely return here in the near future

P.S. if you&apos;re reading this review, Josh, you&apos;re a true toastmaster"
5,"I love everything about Gilt Bar, and it&apos;s my go-to place for any special event, whether it&apos;s a birthday or a date night out. When I say I love everything, I literally mean everything--the food and drinks, impeccable service and ambiance, and the fact that they have a speakeasy and photo booth downstairs.

There&apos;s something for everyone on the menu here. But, I&apos;ve been here several times and I ALWAYS get the truffle pasta. The bucatini is perfectly al dente, and the truffle flavor is so strong. Other dishes I&apos;ve really enjoyed are the pappardelle, gnocchi, the giant meatball, brussel sprouts, and any dessert that comes with ice cream. They have the smoothest ice cream ever. If you get the single scoop ice cream, it actually comes with two scoops! The drinks here are great as well. I tend to like sweeter drinks more and have gotten the Airmail a couple of times as well as the Bee&apos;s Knees and Lillet Rose. Their negronis are great too.

The people here are always so attentive and accommodating, and the decor is beautiful.

Tip--even if you don&apos;t have a reservation for the Library speakeasy below the restaurant, you can ask the hostess about doing dessert and drinks there. They are usually super accommodating about it, and will schedule it in for you after dinner."
5,"Love love love this place. Can I emphasize it more? Great food, great pasta, big desserts, great drinks and great service. 5 stars all the way. Will definitely be back here. Get the lemon meringue and share with 5 people. Pasta is a must. Make reservations for sure as it is hard to get a table. They have a small bar where you can eat as well. Trust!!"
4,"This would be a great date spot! But I was there with friends and my cousin so not so much. The space is gorgeous though! Staff is friendly and way cooler than I will ever be, but that&apos;s OK because I left those feelings back in HS, right? Right.

I had a delicious old fashioned (bourbon) and the pasta with vodka sauce. We shared a lovely brie plate and then I had some delicious chocolate cream pie. In fact we had all the pies and my friend&apos;s photo of his lemon meringue brought some of our other conference friends over for dinner the next night! Never underestimate the power of pie!

Our server was fine with doing separate checks, unfortunately a necessity when you&apos;ll be reimbursed for receipts."
5,"I came here with a local friend while in Chicago for a conference. Upon walking in, I felt like Gilt Bar was a popular restaurant with hidden secrets down the stairs -- which was right! 

Since it came so highly recommended, we shared the Truffle Pasta to start. It was a nice balance of truffle flavor without overpowering the pasta itself. You still get the flavor of the wheat noodles. Overall, one of the best preparations of truffle pasta I&apos;ve had. 

I followed that up with the Double Cut Coal-Fired Ribeye paired with a 2017 Sangiovese. Mmm mmm good. The ribeye was nearly falling apart; it was easy to cut with the fork alone. Brilliant. My friend also very much enjoyed her Pan Roasted Salmon. 

They have a cool and diverse cocktail menu that ranges from mules to martinis and negronis and more. Definitely an enjoyable experience! Don&apos;t miss the downstairs photo booth, which was a fun touch."
4,Came here for work dinner! I really liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. The steak tartare was delicious and a highlight! I tried one of the pastas for my dinner and it was mediocre. We all got espresso martinis for dessert and they were delicious. Recommend checking it out if you haven&apos;t been!  A little pricey but good quality.
5,Delicious pasta! I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and it was really good. We didn&apos;t order a salad but the waiter got our table confused with someone else&apos;s so they just gave it to us for free (we tried telling that it&apos;s not  ours but the waiter just left it on our table and walked away super quickly...). So initially we didn&apos;t even touch the food. And then another waitress came up to us and told us to just keep it. The salad was pretty decent too. I liked the speakeasy downstairs too. What a fun place!
5,"Really darn good food. We originally had a reservation for 9:30 on a Saturday night. Around 7pm we decided we couldn&apos;t wait any longer so stopped by to check the wait. It was an hour &amp; a half wait for inside, so we asked if we could sit outside even though it had rained earlier. They agreed and we had a table in 20 mins.

We ordered a variety of food including garlic appetizer, arugula salad, cheeseburger, prime rib sandwich, huge meatball, and cornbread. We shared all of the food and nothing was short of amazing.

Cannot wait to go back and try the pastas"

The chef made a whole new pasta dish and packaged it up to go!! That&apos;s incredible service!! Above and beyond. I can see why The Gilt and The Library are a hot ticket in Chicago. 

I can not wait to go back! Be sure to book in advance!! This is a super popular spot!!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe this place was so busy on a Tuesday night! We came in around 7 and were told it&apos;d be an hour long wait. Luckily, we were able to snag some couch seats in the bar area so we didn&apos;t have to wait that long. Because it was so busy though, our service took longer and was difficult to get ahold of. 

The table red wine was delicious and a great price surprisingly, so I had two glasses with my meal. I also had to try the famous cheeseburger, and was thoroughly impressed. It was huge, but I finished it because it was so deliciously tasty and tender! Definitely one of the top burgers I&apos;ve had in Chicago.

I love the atmosphere of this place and have still yet to try out the speakeasy. I also love the prices- I am definitely going to be coming back soon for this sexy restaurant atmosphere with amazing food!"
5,"Came here last Wednesday with a couple friends and really enjoyed it. I&apos;m a hogsalt truther (hogsalt does au cheval, bavette&apos;s, gilt bar, etc), so take my review with a grain of salt, but I definitely recommend checking this place out.

We started with the burrata, which was a good, smallish starter for the 4 of us.  The tomatoes were roasted really nicely and had a sweetness to them that I really enjoyed it. 

I ended up getting the orecchiette with spicy sausage for my main.  My girlfriend got the salmon.  The sausage was really good, and the orecchiette was cooked perfectly.  If I were to go again, I would probably try the truffle pasta, I saw it on another table and it looked really good. My girlfriend liked the salmon, it was cooked really well.  She said she would probably try something else next time, but we both really enjoyed our food.

I will say that I enjoy au cheval and bavette&apos;s a little more than gilt bar, but the fact that it&apos;s close is impressive.

Overall - 8.2/10, food is flavorful, service is awesome, and vibe is dark/romantic"
5,"Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a great place to celebrate. We had a reservation and were seated downstairs in the smaller and much quieter library portion, which we enjoyed. We were treated with a free champagne toast to start our meal since we were celebrating which was a great touch!

We started with the burrata which was very creamy and delicious, with good toast and roasted tomatoes. One of our favorite parts of the meal for sure.

We then shared two pastas, the truffle and the waiter recommended orecchiette. Both were awesome, the truffle pasta was nicely balanced and not overpowering with truffle, and the orecchiette was very tasty with a good kick to the sausage but not enough to make someone spice intolerant sweat.

We finished with the burger which I am told is almost the same as Au cheval but I haven&apos;t been there. It was a very good burger with thick bacon and juice running out with every bite. The fries are served with the same garlic aioli that they serve at small cheval which we also love.

Finished with the chocolate cream pie which exceeded my expectations, the Oreo crust and whipped cream definitely make the dish. 

Along they way we tried several drinks, including a well made bourbon Manhattan, a fantastic whiskey sour, and the French martini. 

Basically, everything we ordered was very good and we had a great experience. Would recommend to anybody."
5,"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city and definitely one of the first places I make a resie if a friend is in town visiting. I love that there&apos;s a separate vegetarian menu with tons of delicious options! The restaurant itself is dark and has a bit of an intimate and romantic feel. But, don&apos;t think that it isn&apos;t a great spot for a girls night, too! 

Their vodka sauce rigatoni and truffle bucatini are my absolute favorite pastas on the menu. The pastas are all shareable so get a few for the table to try different dishes. As an app, definitely get the roasted garlic in balsamic. It is served with some bread and is SO simple yet SO delicious!! I also love how robust their drink menu is - tons of options for old fashioned, martinis, etc. I still just get the dirty martini, but they do it so well. 

Overall, I love this place and will keep coming back! I highly recommend it - whether it&apos;s for a date night, girls night, or whatever occasion."
5,"Mmmm mmm! This place was recommended by a friend and I&apos;m glad I went!
I like that you can order a whole or half for the pasta....so you can leave room in your tummy for more food.
They also have another restaurant/bar/speakeasy downstairs. It&apos;s behind a hidden door. I recommend if you want some good Italian food."
5,"Returned here with my boyfriend when he came into town this past weekend. I was so impressed with how the staff handled our reservations. There was some stress as we had originally made a reso for Friday night and then when his flight was canceled for the crazy Chicago storms, we had to cancel. The only available reso for Saturday was 6 PM and his new flight came in 5:20 PM Saturday. The woman who was directing the main line worked with me/stayed in touch to help ensure we would still be seated at one of our favorite restaurants. When we arrived close to 7, she seated us almost immediately. 

We were taken care of SO well and had our favorite- the bone marrow for appetizer, a dark &amp; stormy for me (Mule), an Old Fashioned for him, some delicious pasta, salmon, and another drink (on the house!). We were exceptionally pleased with how well we were treated, especially as it had been a very long week for both of us and we just wanted to relax &amp; decompress together.

All in all, the evening could not have been more lovely. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, the staff was attentive to our needs, and the ambiance/environment is second to none. Definitely come here if you need a romantic/softly lit/delicious restaurant for a date night."
5,"I like to get steak tartar whenever I see it on a menu (including Paris) and this is my favorite one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a huge serving, the egg is perfect, the bread is delicious. Must try!!"
4,"We came to Gilt Bar on a recommendation from a Chicago native - this is definitely a spot worth visiting!

The hostess seated us promptly for our 7:30 Friday reservation, which is easier said then done for many places. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I had a rye old fashioned to start, which was well-made and just what you expect from a cocktail bar. For food, I ended up going with the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Truffle Pasta. While my dish was very good, I had major food envy with the Truffle Pasta - the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the truffle was delicious. We saved some room for dessert and got the skillet cookie &amp; ice cream, which was more than enough for two people and provided a satisfying end to the meal.

The only downside to Gilt Bar was that we felt the lighting was too dim - I get trying to set a mood, but we had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu, even after our eyes adjusted. This was our only minor quibble with an otherwise great experience."
5,"Yes! This place is so good. 

The short: expansive drink menu, reasonably priced delicious food, sultry ambiance and good service. 

The long: Came here with a group of four friends and had a great experience from start to finish. We had a Friday 8pm reservation and were seated at a window seat immediately. Our waitress quickly came over with our drink menus which I always appreciate. I ordered the Spanish Old Fashioned which was really nice. It had a slight twist but was not too out of the ordinary. 

For appetizers we ordered the garlic, salmon cesar salad and the beef tartar. The salmon salad was delicious and I loved how you could order half portions of all the salads. The garlic oil and bread was good however I wish there was a greater clove to oil ratio. I did not try the tartar but the table loved it. 

For dinner we split the orecchiette and the truffle pasta. They were both super flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend both of these dishes. They are portioned very nice to split. We had also ordered the mashed potatoes but our waitress forget to bring them to the table which was fine with me since I was pleasantly full. 

Overall, Gilt bar is a wonderful place to share a couple of dishes with good friends. I would definitely return here in the near future

P.S. if you&apos;re reading this review, Josh, you&apos;re a true toastmaster"
5,"I love everything about Gilt Bar, and it&apos;s my go-to place for any special event, whether it&apos;s a birthday or a date night out. When I say I love everything, I literally mean everything--the food and drinks, impeccable service and ambiance, and the fact that they have a speakeasy and photo booth downstairs.

There&apos;s something for everyone on the menu here. But, I&apos;ve been here several times and I ALWAYS get the truffle pasta. The bucatini is perfectly al dente, and the truffle flavor is so strong. Other dishes I&apos;ve really enjoyed are the pappardelle, gnocchi, the giant meatball, brussel sprouts, and any dessert that comes with ice cream. They have the smoothest ice cream ever. If you get the single scoop ice cream, it actually comes with two scoops! The drinks here are great as well. I tend to like sweeter drinks more and have gotten the Airmail a couple of times as well as the Bee&apos;s Knees and Lillet Rose. Their negronis are great too.

The people here are always so attentive and accommodating, and the decor is beautiful.

Tip--even if you don&apos;t have a reservation for the Library speakeasy below the restaurant, you can ask the hostess about doing dessert and drinks there. They are usually super accommodating about it, and will schedule it in for you after dinner."
5,"Love love love this place. Can I emphasize it more? Great food, great pasta, big desserts, great drinks and great service. 5 stars all the way. Will definitely be back here. Get the lemon meringue and share with 5 people. Pasta is a must. Make reservations for sure as it is hard to get a table. They have a small bar where you can eat as well. Trust!!"
4,"This would be a great date spot! But I was there with friends and my cousin so not so much. The space is gorgeous though! Staff is friendly and way cooler than I will ever be, but that&apos;s OK because I left those feelings back in HS, right? Right.

I had a delicious old fashioned (bourbon) and the pasta with vodka sauce. We shared a lovely brie plate and then I had some delicious chocolate cream pie. In fact we had all the pies and my friend&apos;s photo of his lemon meringue brought some of our other conference friends over for dinner the next night! Never underestimate the power of pie!

Our server was fine with doing separate checks, unfortunately a necessity when you&apos;ll be reimbursed for receipts."
5,"I came here with a local friend while in Chicago for a conference. Upon walking in, I felt like Gilt Bar was a popular restaurant with hidden secrets down the stairs -- which was right! 

Since it came so highly recommended, we shared the Truffle Pasta to start. It was a nice balance of truffle flavor without overpowering the pasta itself. You still get the flavor of the wheat noodles. Overall, one of the best preparations of truffle pasta I&apos;ve had. 

I followed that up with the Double Cut Coal-Fired Ribeye paired with a 2017 Sangiovese. Mmm mmm good. The ribeye was nearly falling apart; it was easy to cut with the fork alone. Brilliant. My friend also very much enjoyed her Pan Roasted Salmon. 

They have a cool and diverse cocktail menu that ranges from mules to martinis and negronis and more. Definitely an enjoyable experience! Don&apos;t miss the downstairs photo booth, which was a fun touch."
4,Came here for work dinner! I really liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. The steak tartare was delicious and a highlight! I tried one of the pastas for my dinner and it was mediocre. We all got espresso martinis for dessert and they were delicious. Recommend checking it out if you haven&apos;t been!  A little pricey but good quality.
5,Delicious pasta! I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and it was really good. We didn&apos;t order a salad but the waiter got our table confused with someone else&apos;s so they just gave it to us for free (we tried telling that it&apos;s not  ours but the waiter just left it on our table and walked away super quickly...). So initially we didn&apos;t even touch the food. And then another waitress came up to us and told us to just keep it. The salad was pretty decent too. I liked the speakeasy downstairs too. What a fun place!
5,"Really darn good food. We originally had a reservation for 9:30 on a Saturday night. Around 7pm we decided we couldn&apos;t wait any longer so stopped by to check the wait. It was an hour &amp; a half wait for inside, so we asked if we could sit outside even though it had rained earlier. They agreed and we had a table in 20 mins.

We ordered a variety of food including garlic appetizer, arugula salad, cheeseburger, prime rib sandwich, huge meatball, and cornbread. We shared all of the food and nothing was short of amazing.

Cannot wait to go back and try the pastas"
5,Love this place! Cute charm and the staff is always so great! Food is amazing. Try the chocolate cream pie!
4,"I got the Spicy Pork Rigatoni carry out. It was solid for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a 5 star pasta. 

When I went inside to get my order, the ambiance and decor seemed excellent. I suspect that this would be an incredible place to spend a night with friends.

I have no doubt that Gilt Bar could be a 5 star restaurant, but for me, I had a 4 star carry out experience."
5,Dinner here was amazing. The meatballs were definitely the highlight of the night--they are without a doubt the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. The toased garlic bread that came with the meatballs was equally delicious. The dining room is very low-lit and cultivates a really nice date vibe. There&apos;s also a photobooth in the basement which is fun! Gilt Bar is simply the perfect place for a dinner date.
5,"Of my 600+ Yelp reviews, I&apos;m going to guess at least 100 are for restaurants. Of those 100 restaurants, NOTHING compares to the Gilt Bar, and the Library downstairs, in terms of service!! I was blown away tonight, my first visit to the Gilt and the Library (the &apos;secret&apos; speakeasy located under the Gilt.) 

Other Yelpers have praised the delicious food, hearty cocktails, fabulous ambiance, and rich decor. All amazing. But what truly stood out tonight was the exceptional service from the hostesses, wait staff, bus staff, and bartenders. 

Tonight I celebrated a very special health-related occasion, my one-year anniversary of being cancer free. 3 staff members congratulated me! The waitress surprised me with a sparkler in my ice cream!!  And we were given a table in the library for cocktails after our meal. It was perfect. 

Oh, my friend forgot his left-overs upstairs in the Gilt Bar and when he went back to look for them, the to-go bag was gone.

If I were to go again, I would probably try the truffle pasta, I saw it on another table and it looked really good. My girlfriend liked the salmon, it was cooked really well.  She said she would probably try something else next time, but we both really enjoyed our food.

I will say that I enjoy au cheval and bavette&apos;s a little more than gilt bar, but the fact that it&apos;s close is impressive.

Overall - 8.2/10, food is flavorful, service is awesome, and vibe is dark/romantic"
5,"Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a great place to celebrate. We had a reservation and were seated downstairs in the smaller and much quieter library portion, which we enjoyed. We were treated with a free champagne toast to start our meal since we were celebrating which was a great touch!

We started with the burrata which was very creamy and delicious, with good toast and roasted tomatoes. One of our favorite parts of the meal for sure.

We then shared two pastas, the truffle and the waiter recommended orecchiette. Both were awesome, the truffle pasta was nicely balanced and not overpowering with truffle, and the orecchiette was very tasty with a good kick to the sausage but not enough to make someone spice intolerant sweat.

We finished with the burger which I am told is almost the same as Au cheval but I haven&apos;t been there. It was a very good burger with thick bacon and juice running out with every bite. The fries are served with the same garlic aioli that they serve at small cheval which we also love.

Finished with the chocolate cream pie which exceeded my expectations, the Oreo crust and whipped cream definitely make the dish. 

Along they way we tried several drinks, including a well made bourbon Manhattan, a fantastic whiskey sour, and the French martini. 

Basically, everything we ordered was very good and we had a great experience. Would recommend to anybody."
5,"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city and definitely one of the first places I make a resie if a friend is in town visiting. I love that there&apos;s a separate vegetarian menu with tons of delicious options! The restaurant itself is dark and has a bit of an intimate and romantic feel. But, don&apos;t think that it isn&apos;t a great spot for a girls night, too! 

Their vodka sauce rigatoni and truffle bucatini are my absolute favorite pastas on the menu. The pastas are all shareable so get a few for the table to try different dishes. As an app, definitely get the roasted garlic in balsamic. It is served with some bread and is SO simple yet SO delicious!! I also love how robust their drink menu is - tons of options for old fashioned, martinis, etc. I still just get the dirty martini, but they do it so well. 

Overall, I love this place and will keep coming back! I highly recommend it - whether it&apos;s for a date night, girls night, or whatever occasion."
5,"Mmmm mmm! This place was recommended by a friend and I&apos;m glad I went!
I like that you can order a whole or half for the pasta....so you can leave room in your tummy for more food.
They also have another restaurant/bar/speakeasy downstairs. It&apos;s behind a hidden door. I recommend if you want some good Italian food."
5,"Returned here with my boyfriend when he came into town this past weekend. I was so impressed with how the staff handled our reservations. There was some stress as we had originally made a reso for Friday night and then when his flight was canceled for the crazy Chicago storms, we had to cancel. The only available reso for Saturday was 6 PM and his new flight came in 5:20 PM Saturday. The woman who was directing the main line worked with me/stayed in touch to help ensure we would still be seated at one of our favorite restaurants. When we arrived close to 7, she seated us almost immediately. 

We were taken care of SO well and had our favorite- the bone marrow for appetizer, a dark &amp; stormy for me (Mule), an Old Fashioned for him, some delicious pasta, salmon, and another drink (on the house!). We were exceptionally pleased with how well we were treated, especially as it had been a very long week for both of us and we just wanted to relax &amp; decompress together.

All in all, the evening could not have been more lovely. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, the staff was attentive to our needs, and the ambiance/environment is second to none. Definitely come here if you need a romantic/softly lit/delicious restaurant for a date night."
5,"I like to get steak tartar whenever I see it on a menu (including Paris) and this is my favorite one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a huge serving, the egg is perfect, the bread is delicious. Must try!!"
4,"We came to Gilt Bar on a recommendation from a Chicago native - this is definitely a spot worth visiting!

The hostess seated us promptly for our 7:30 Friday reservation, which is easier said then done for many places. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I had a rye old fashioned to start, which was well-made and just what you expect from a cocktail bar. For food, I ended up going with the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Truffle Pasta. While my dish was very good, I had major food envy with the Truffle Pasta - the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the truffle was delicious. We saved some room for dessert and got the skillet cookie &amp; ice cream, which was more than enough for two people and provided a satisfying end to the meal.

The only downside to Gilt Bar was that we felt the lighting was too dim - I get trying to set a mood, but we had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu, even after our eyes adjusted. This was our only minor quibble with an otherwise great experience."
5,"Yes! This place is so good. 

The short: expansive drink menu, reasonably priced delicious food, sultry ambiance and good service. 

The long: Came here with a group of four friends and had a great experience from start to finish. We had a Friday 8pm reservation and were seated at a window seat immediately. Our waitress quickly came over with our drink menus which I always appreciate. I ordered the Spanish Old Fashioned which was really nice. It had a slight twist but was not too out of the ordinary. 

For appetizers we ordered the garlic, salmon cesar salad and the beef tartar. The salmon salad was delicious and I loved how you could order half portions of all the salads. The garlic oil and bread was good however I wish there was a greater clove to oil ratio. I did not try the tartar but the table loved it. 

For dinner we split the orecchiette and the truffle pasta. They were both super flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend both of these dishes. They are portioned very nice to split. We had also ordered the mashed potatoes but our waitress forget to bring them to the table which was fine with me since I was pleasantly full. 

Overall, Gilt bar is a wonderful place to share a couple of dishes with good friends. I would definitely return here in the near future

P.S. if you&apos;re reading this review, Josh, you&apos;re a true toastmaster"
5,"I love everything about Gilt Bar, and it&apos;s my go-to place for any special event, whether it&apos;s a birthday or a date night out. When I say I love everything, I literally mean everything--the food and drinks, impeccable service and ambiance, and the fact that they have a speakeasy and photo booth downstairs.

There&apos;s something for everyone on the menu here. But, I&apos;ve been here several times and I ALWAYS get the truffle pasta. The bucatini is perfectly al dente, and the truffle flavor is so strong. Other dishes I&apos;ve really enjoyed are the pappardelle, gnocchi, the giant meatball, brussel sprouts, and any dessert that comes with ice cream. They have the smoothest ice cream ever. If you get the single scoop ice cream, it actually comes with two scoops! The drinks here are great as well. I tend to like sweeter drinks more and have gotten the Airmail a couple of times as well as the Bee&apos;s Knees and Lillet Rose. Their negronis are great too.

The people here are always so attentive and accommodating, and the decor is beautiful.

Tip--even if you don&apos;t have a reservation for the Library speakeasy below the restaurant, you can ask the hostess about doing dessert and drinks there. They are usually super accommodating about it, and will schedule it in for you after dinner."
5,"Love love love this place. Can I emphasize it more? Great food, great pasta, big desserts, great drinks and great service. 5 stars all the way. Will definitely be back here. Get the lemon meringue and share with 5 people. Pasta is a must. Make reservations for sure as it is hard to get a table. They have a small bar where you can eat as well. Trust!!"
4,"This would be a great date spot! But I was there with friends and my cousin so not so much. The space is gorgeous though! Staff is friendly and way cooler than I will ever be, but that&apos;s OK because I left those feelings back in HS, right? Right.

I had a delicious old fashioned (bourbon) and the pasta with vodka sauce. We shared a lovely brie plate and then I had some delicious chocolate cream pie. In fact we had all the pies and my friend&apos;s photo of his lemon meringue brought some of our other conference friends over for dinner the next night! Never underestimate the power of pie!

Our server was fine with doing separate checks, unfortunately a necessity when you&apos;ll be reimbursed for receipts."
5,"I came here with a local friend while in Chicago for a conference. Upon walking in, I felt like Gilt Bar was a popular restaurant with hidden secrets down the stairs -- which was right! 

Since it came so highly recommended, we shared the Truffle Pasta to start. It was a nice balance of truffle flavor without overpowering the pasta itself. You still get the flavor of the wheat noodles. Overall, one of the best preparations of truffle pasta I&apos;ve had. 

I followed that up with the Double Cut Coal-Fired Ribeye paired with a 2017 Sangiovese. Mmm mmm good. The ribeye was nearly falling apart; it was easy to cut with the fork alone. Brilliant. My friend also very much enjoyed her Pan Roasted Salmon. 

They have a cool and diverse cocktail menu that ranges from mules to martinis and negronis and more. Definitely an enjoyable experience! Don&apos;t miss the downstairs photo booth, which was a fun touch."
4,Came here for work dinner! I really liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. The steak tartare was delicious and a highlight! I tried one of the pastas for my dinner and it was mediocre. We all got espresso martinis for dessert and they were delicious. Recommend checking it out if you haven&apos;t been!  A little pricey but good quality.
5,Delicious pasta! I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and it was really good. We didn&apos;t order a salad but the waiter got our table confused with someone else&apos;s so they just gave it to us for free (we tried telling that it&apos;s not  ours but the waiter just left it on our table and walked away super quickly...). So initially we didn&apos;t even touch the food. And then another waitress came up to us and told us to just keep it. The salad was pretty decent too. I liked the speakeasy downstairs too. What a fun place!
5,"Really darn good food. We originally had a reservation for 9:30 on a Saturday night. Around 7pm we decided we couldn&apos;t wait any longer so stopped by to check the wait. It was an hour &amp; a half wait for inside, so we asked if we could sit outside even though it had rained earlier. They agreed and we had a table in 20 mins.

We ordered a variety of food including garlic appetizer, arugula salad, cheeseburger, prime rib sandwich, huge meatball, and cornbread. We shared all of the food and nothing was short of amazing.

Cannot wait to go back and try the pastas"
5,Love this place! Cute charm and the staff is always so great! Food is amazing. Try the chocolate cream pie!
4,"I got the Spicy Pork Rigatoni carry out. It was solid for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a 5 star pasta. 

When I went inside to get my order, the ambiance and decor seemed excellent. I suspect that this would be an incredible place to spend a night with friends.

I have no doubt that Gilt Bar could be a 5 star restaurant, but for me, I had a 4 star carry out experience."
5,Dinner here was amazing. The meatballs were definitely the highlight of the night--they are without a doubt the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. The toased garlic bread that came with the meatballs was equally delicious. The dining room is very low-lit and cultivates a really nice date vibe. There&apos;s also a photobooth in the basement which is fun! Gilt Bar is simply the perfect place for a dinner date.
5,"Of my 600+ Yelp reviews, I&apos;m going to guess at least 100 are for restaurants. Of those 100 restaurants, NOTHING compares to the Gilt Bar, and the Library downstairs, in terms of service!! I was blown away tonight, my first visit to the Gilt and the Library (the &apos;secret&apos; speakeasy located under the Gilt.) 

Other Yelpers have praised the delicious food, hearty cocktails, fabulous ambiance, and rich decor. All amazing. But what truly stood out tonight was the exceptional service from the hostesses, wait staff, bus staff, and bartenders. 

Tonight I celebrated a very special health-related occasion, my one-year anniversary of being cancer free. 3 staff members congratulated me! The waitress surprised me with a sparkler in my ice cream!!  And we were given a table in the library for cocktails after our meal. It was perfect. 

Oh, my friend forgot his left-overs upstairs in the Gilt Bar and when he went back to look for them, the to-go bag was gone. He was bummed but just shrugged it off, but then as we were leaving the Library after a round of cocktails, the waitress showed up at our table with a to-go bag. With a whole new order!! For free!! The chef made a whole new pasta dish and packaged it up to go!! That&apos;s incredible service!! Above and beyond. I can see why The Gilt and The Library are a hot ticket in Chicago. 

I can not wait to go back! Be sure to book in advance!! This is a super popular spot!!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe this place was so busy on a Tuesday night! We came in around 7 and were told it&apos;d be an hour long wait. Luckily, we were able to snag some couch seats in the bar area so we didn&apos;t have to wait that long. Because it was so busy though, our service took longer and was difficult to get ahold of. 

The table red wine was delicious and a great price surprisingly, so I had two glasses with my meal. I also had to try the famous cheeseburger, and was thoroughly impressed. It was huge, but I finished it because it was so deliciously tasty and tender! Definitely one of the top burgers I&apos;ve had in Chicago.

I love the atmosphere of this place and have still yet to try out the speakeasy. I also love the prices- I am definitely going to be coming back soon for this sexy restaurant atmosphere with amazing food!"
5,"Came here last Wednesday with a couple friends and really enjoyed it. I&apos;m a hogsalt truther (hogsalt does au cheval, bavette&apos;s, gilt bar, etc), so take my review with a grain of salt, but I definitely recommend checking this place out.

5,"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city and definitely one of the first places I make a resie if a friend is in town visiting. I love that there&apos;s a separate vegetarian menu with tons of delicious options! The restaurant itself is dark and has a bit of an intimate and romantic feel. But, don&apos;t think that it isn&apos;t a great spot for a girls night, too! 

Their vodka sauce rigatoni and truffle bucatini are my absolute favorite pastas on the menu. The pastas are all shareable so get a few for the table to try different dishes. As an app, definitely get the roasted garlic in balsamic. It is served with some bread and is SO simple yet SO delicious!! I also love how robust their drink menu is - tons of options for old fashioned, martinis, etc. I still just get the dirty martini, but they do it so well. 

Overall, I love this place and will keep coming back! I highly recommend it - whether it&apos;s for a date night, girls night, or whatever occasion."
5,"Mmmm mmm! This place was recommended by a friend and I&apos;m glad I went!
I like that you can order a whole or half for the pasta....so you can leave room in your tummy for more food.
They also have another restaurant/bar/speakeasy downstairs. It&apos;s behind a hidden door. I recommend if you want some good Italian food."
5,"Returned here with my boyfriend when he came into town this past weekend. I was so impressed with how the staff handled our reservations. There was some stress as we had originally made a reso for Friday night and then when his flight was canceled for the crazy Chicago storms, we had to cancel. The only available reso for Saturday was 6 PM and his new flight came in 5:20 PM Saturday. The woman who was directing the main line worked with me/stayed in touch to help ensure we would still be seated at one of our favorite restaurants. When we arrived close to 7, she seated us almost immediately. 

We were taken care of SO well and had our favorite- the bone marrow for appetizer, a dark &amp; stormy for me (Mule), an Old Fashioned for him, some delicious pasta, salmon, and another drink (on the house!). We were exceptionally pleased with how well we were treated, especially as it had been a very long week for both of us and we just wanted to relax &amp; decompress together.

All in all, the evening could not have been more lovely. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, the staff was attentive to our needs, and the ambiance/environment is second to none. Definitely come here if you need a romantic/softly lit/delicious restaurant for a date night."
5,"I like to get steak tartar whenever I see it on a menu (including Paris) and this is my favorite one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a huge serving, the egg is perfect, the bread is delicious. Must try!!"
4,"We came to Gilt Bar on a recommendation from a Chicago native - this is definitely a spot worth visiting!

The hostess seated us promptly for our 7:30 Friday reservation, which is easier said then done for many places. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I had a rye old fashioned to start, which was well-made and just what you expect from a cocktail bar. For food, I ended up going with the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Truffle Pasta. While my dish was very good, I had major food envy with the Truffle Pasta - the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the truffle was delicious. We saved some room for dessert and got the skillet cookie &amp; ice cream, which was more than enough for two people and provided a satisfying end to the meal.

The only downside to Gilt Bar was that we felt the lighting was too dim - I get trying to set a mood, but we had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu, even after our eyes adjusted. This was our only minor quibble with an otherwise great experience."
5,"Yes! This place is so good. 

The short: expansive drink menu, reasonably priced delicious food, sultry ambiance and good service. 

The long: Came here with a group of four friends and had a great experience from start to finish. We had a Friday 8pm reservation and were seated at a window seat immediately. Our waitress quickly came over with our drink menus which I always appreciate. I ordered the Spanish Old Fashioned which was really nice. It had a slight twist but was not too out of the ordinary. 

For appetizers we ordered the garlic, salmon cesar salad and the beef tartar. The salmon salad was delicious and I loved how you could order half portions of all the salads. The garlic oil and bread was good however I wish there was a greater clove to oil ratio. I did not try the tartar but the table loved it. 

For dinner we split the orecchiette and the truffle pasta. They were both super flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend both of these dishes. They are portioned very nice to split. We had also ordered the mashed potatoes but our waitress forget to bring them to the table which was fine with me since I was pleasantly full. 

Overall, Gilt bar is a wonderful place to share a couple of dishes with good friends. I would definitely return here in the near future

P.S. if you&apos;re reading this review, Josh, you&apos;re a true toastmaster"
5,"I love everything about Gilt Bar, and it&apos;s my go-to place for any special event, whether it&apos;s a birthday or a date night out. When I say I love everything, I literally mean everything--the food and drinks, impeccable service and ambiance, and the fact that they have a speakeasy and photo booth downstairs.

There&apos;s something for everyone on the menu here. But, I&apos;ve been here several times and I ALWAYS get the truffle pasta. The bucatini is perfectly al dente, and the truffle flavor is so strong. Other dishes I&apos;ve really enjoyed are the pappardelle, gnocchi, the giant meatball, brussel sprouts, and any dessert that comes with ice cream. They have the smoothest ice cream ever. If you get the single scoop ice cream, it actually comes with two scoops! The drinks here are great as well. I tend to like sweeter drinks more and have gotten the Airmail a couple of times as well as the Bee&apos;s Knees and Lillet Rose. Their negronis are great too.

The people here are always so attentive and accommodating, and the decor is beautiful.

Tip--even if you don&apos;t have a reservation for the Library speakeasy below the restaurant, you can ask the hostess about doing dessert and drinks there. They are usually super accommodating about it, and will schedule it in for you after dinner."
5,"Love love love this place. Can I emphasize it more? Great food, great pasta, big desserts, great drinks and great service. 5 stars all the way. Will definitely be back here. Get the lemon meringue and share with 5 people. Pasta is a must. Make reservations for sure as it is hard to get a table. They have a small bar where you can eat as well. Trust!!"
4,"This would be a great date spot! But I was there with friends and my cousin so not so much. The space is gorgeous though! Staff is friendly and way cooler than I will ever be, but that&apos;s OK because I left those feelings back in HS, right? Right.

I had a delicious old fashioned (bourbon) and the pasta with vodka sauce. We shared a lovely brie plate and then I had some delicious chocolate cream pie. In fact we had all the pies and my friend&apos;s photo of his lemon meringue brought some of our other conference friends over for dinner the next night! Never underestimate the power of pie!

Our server was fine with doing separate checks, unfortunately a necessity when you&apos;ll be reimbursed for receipts."
5,"I came here with a local friend while in Chicago for a conference. Upon walking in, I felt like Gilt Bar was a popular restaurant with hidden secrets down the stairs -- which was right! 

Since it came so highly recommended, we shared the Truffle Pasta to start. It was a nice balance of truffle flavor without overpowering the pasta itself. You still get the flavor of the wheat noodles. Overall, one of the best preparations of truffle pasta I&apos;ve had. 

I followed that up with the Double Cut Coal-Fired Ribeye paired with a 2017 Sangiovese. Mmm mmm good. The ribeye was nearly falling apart; it was easy to cut with the fork alone. Brilliant. My friend also very much enjoyed her Pan Roasted Salmon. 

They have a cool and diverse cocktail menu that ranges from mules to martinis and negronis and more. Definitely an enjoyable experience! Don&apos;t miss the downstairs photo booth, which was a fun touch."
4,Came here for work dinner! I really liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. The steak tartare was delicious and a highlight! I tried one of the pastas for my dinner and it was mediocre. We all got espresso martinis for dessert and they were delicious. Recommend checking it out if you haven&apos;t been!  A little pricey but good quality.
5,Delicious pasta! I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and it was really good. We didn&apos;t order a salad but the waiter got our table confused with someone else&apos;s so they just gave it to us for free (we tried telling that it&apos;s not  ours but the waiter just left it on our table and walked away super quickly...). So initially we didn&apos;t even touch the food. And then another waitress came up to us and told us to just keep it. The salad was pretty decent too. I liked the speakeasy downstairs too. What a fun place!
5,"Really darn good food. We originally had a reservation for 9:30 on a Saturday night. Around 7pm we decided we couldn&apos;t wait any longer so stopped by to check the wait. It was an hour &amp; a half wait for inside, so we asked if we could sit outside even though it had rained earlier. They agreed and we had a table in 20 mins.

We ordered a variety of food including garlic appetizer, arugula salad, cheeseburger, prime rib sandwich, huge meatball, and cornbread. We shared all of the food and nothing was short of amazing.

Cannot wait to go back and try the pastas"
5,Love this place! Cute charm and the staff is always so great! Food is amazing. Try the chocolate cream pie!
4,"I got the Spicy Pork Rigatoni carry out. It was solid for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a 5 star pasta. 

When I went inside to get my order, the ambiance and decor seemed excellent. I suspect that this would be an incredible place to spend a night with friends.

I have no doubt that Gilt Bar could be a 5 star restaurant, but for me, I had a 4 star carry out experience."
5,Dinner here was amazing. The meatballs were definitely the highlight of the night--they are without a doubt the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. The toased garlic bread that came with the meatballs was equally delicious. The dining room is very low-lit and cultivates a really nice date vibe. There&apos;s also a photobooth in the basement which is fun! Gilt Bar is simply the perfect place for a dinner date.
5,"Of my 600+ Yelp reviews, I&apos;m going to guess at least 100 are for restaurants. Of those 100 restaurants, NOTHING compares to the Gilt Bar, and the Library downstairs, in terms of service!! I was blown away tonight, my first visit to the Gilt and the Library (the &apos;secret&apos; speakeasy located under the Gilt.) 

Other Yelpers have praised the delicious food, hearty cocktails, fabulous ambiance, and rich decor. All amazing. But what truly stood out tonight was the exceptional service from the hostesses, wait staff, bus staff, and bartenders. 

Tonight I celebrated a very special health-related occasion, my one-year anniversary of being cancer free. 3 staff members congratulated me! The waitress surprised me with a sparkler in my ice cream!!  And we were given a table in the library for cocktails after our meal. It was perfect. 

Oh, my friend forgot his left-overs upstairs in the Gilt Bar and when he went back to look for them, the to-go bag was gone. He was bummed but just shrugged it off, but then as we were leaving the Library after a round of cocktails, the waitress showed up at our table with a to-go bag. With a whole new order!! For free!! The chef made a whole new pasta dish and packaged it up to go!! That&apos;s incredible service!! Above and beyond. I can see why The Gilt and The Library are a hot ticket in Chicago. 

I can not wait to go back! Be sure to book in advance!! This is a super popular spot!!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe this place was so busy on a Tuesday night! We came in around 7 and were told it&apos;d be an hour long wait. Luckily, we were able to snag some couch seats in the bar area so we didn&apos;t have to wait that long. Because it was so busy though, our service took longer and was difficult to get ahold of. 

The table red wine was delicious and a great price surprisingly, so I had two glasses with my meal. I also had to try the famous cheeseburger, and was thoroughly impressed. It was huge, but I finished it because it was so deliciously tasty and tender! Definitely one of the top burgers I&apos;ve had in Chicago.

I love the atmosphere of this place and have still yet to try out the speakeasy. I also love the prices- I am definitely going to be coming back soon for this sexy restaurant atmosphere with amazing food!"
5,"Came here last Wednesday with a couple friends and really enjoyed it. I&apos;m a hogsalt truther (hogsalt does au cheval, bavette&apos;s, gilt bar, etc), so take my review with a grain of salt, but I definitely recommend checking this place out.

We started with the burrata, which was a good, smallish starter for the 4 of us.  The tomatoes were roasted really nicely and had a sweetness to them that I really enjoyed it. 

I ended up getting the orecchiette with spicy sausage for my main.  My girlfriend got the salmon.  The sausage was really good, and the orecchiette was cooked perfectly.  If I were to go again, I would probably try the truffle pasta, I saw it on another table and it looked really good. My girlfriend liked the salmon, it was cooked really well.  She said she would probably try something else next time, but we both really enjoyed our food.

I will say that I enjoy au cheval and bavette&apos;s a little more than gilt bar, but the fact that it&apos;s close is impressive.

Overall - 8.2/10, food is flavorful, service is awesome, and vibe is dark/romantic"
5,"Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a great place to celebrate. We had a reservation and were seated downstairs in the smaller and much quieter library portion, which we enjoyed. We were treated with a free champagne toast to start our meal since we were celebrating which was a great touch!

We started with the burrata which was very creamy and delicious, with good toast and roasted tomatoes. One of our favorite parts of the meal for sure.

We then shared two pastas, the truffle and the waiter recommended orecchiette. Both were awesome, the truffle pasta was nicely balanced and not overpowering with truffle, and the orecchiette was very tasty with a good kick to the sausage but not enough to make someone spice intolerant sweat.

We finished with the burger which I am told is almost the same as Au cheval but I haven&apos;t been there. It was a very good burger with thick bacon and juice running out with every bite. The fries are served with the same garlic aioli that they serve at small cheval which we also love.

Finished with the chocolate cream pie which exceeded my expectations, the Oreo crust and whipped cream definitely make the dish. 

Along they way we tried several drinks, including a well made bourbon Manhattan, a fantastic whiskey sour, and the French martini. 

Basically, everything we ordered was very good and we had a great experience. Would recommend to anybody."

We were taken care of SO well and had our favorite- the bone marrow for appetizer, a dark &amp; stormy for me (Mule), an Old Fashioned for him, some delicious pasta, salmon, and another drink (on the house!). We were exceptionally pleased with how well we were treated, especially as it had been a very long week for both of us and we just wanted to relax &amp; decompress together.

All in all, the evening could not have been more lovely. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, the staff was attentive to our needs, and the ambiance/environment is second to none. Definitely come here if you need a romantic/softly lit/delicious restaurant for a date night."
5,"I like to get steak tartar whenever I see it on a menu (including Paris) and this is my favorite one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a huge serving, the egg is perfect, the bread is delicious. Must try!!"
4,"We came to Gilt Bar on a recommendation from a Chicago native - this is definitely a spot worth visiting!

The hostess seated us promptly for our 7:30 Friday reservation, which is easier said then done for many places. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I had a rye old fashioned to start, which was well-made and just what you expect from a cocktail bar. For food, I ended up going with the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Truffle Pasta. While my dish was very good, I had major food envy with the Truffle Pasta - the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the truffle was delicious. We saved some room for dessert and got the skillet cookie &amp; ice cream, which was more than enough for two people and provided a satisfying end to the meal.

The only downside to Gilt Bar was that we felt the lighting was too dim - I get trying to set a mood, but we had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu, even after our eyes adjusted. This was our only minor quibble with an otherwise great experience."
5,"Yes! This place is so good. 

The short: expansive drink menu, reasonably priced delicious food, sultry ambiance and good service. 

The long: Came here with a group of four friends and had a great experience from start to finish. We had a Friday 8pm reservation and were seated at a window seat immediately. Our waitress quickly came over with our drink menus which I always appreciate. I ordered the Spanish Old Fashioned which was really nice. It had a slight twist but was not too out of the ordinary. 

For appetizers we ordered the garlic, salmon cesar salad and the beef tartar. The salmon salad was delicious and I loved how you could order half portions of all the salads. The garlic oil and bread was good however I wish there was a greater clove to oil ratio. I did not try the tartar but the table loved it. 

For dinner we split the orecchiette and the truffle pasta. They were both super flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend both of these dishes. They are portioned very nice to split. We had also ordered the mashed potatoes but our waitress forget to bring them to the table which was fine with me since I was pleasantly full. 

Overall, Gilt bar is a wonderful place to share a couple of dishes with good friends. I would definitely return here in the near future

P.S. if you&apos;re reading this review, Josh, you&apos;re a true toastmaster"
5,"I love everything about Gilt Bar, and it&apos;s my go-to place for any special event, whether it&apos;s a birthday or a date night out. When I say I love everything, I literally mean everything--the food and drinks, impeccable service and ambiance, and the fact that they have a speakeasy and photo booth downstairs.

There&apos;s something for everyone on the menu here. But, I&apos;ve been here several times and I ALWAYS get the truffle pasta. The bucatini is perfectly al dente, and the truffle flavor is so strong. Other dishes I&apos;ve really enjoyed are the pappardelle, gnocchi, the giant meatball, brussel sprouts, and any dessert that comes with ice cream. They have the smoothest ice cream ever. If you get the single scoop ice cream, it actually comes with two scoops! The drinks here are great as well. I tend to like sweeter drinks more and have gotten the Airmail a couple of times as well as the Bee&apos;s Knees and Lillet Rose. Their negronis are great too.

The people here are always so attentive and accommodating, and the decor is beautiful.

Tip--even if you don&apos;t have a reservation for the Library speakeasy below the restaurant, you can ask the hostess about doing dessert and drinks there. They are usually super accommodating about it, and will schedule it in for you after dinner."
5,"Love love love this place. Can I emphasize it more? Great food, great pasta, big desserts, great drinks and great service. 5 stars all the way. Will definitely be back here. Get the lemon meringue and share with 5 people. Pasta is a must. Make reservations for sure as it is hard to get a table. They have a small bar where you can eat as well. Trust!!"
4,"This would be a great date spot! But I was there with friends and my cousin so not so much. The space is gorgeous though! Staff is friendly and way cooler than I will ever be, but that&apos;s OK because I left those feelings back in HS, right? Right.

I had a delicious old fashioned (bourbon) and the pasta with vodka sauce. We shared a lovely brie plate and then I had some delicious chocolate cream pie. In fact we had all the pies and my friend&apos;s photo of his lemon meringue brought some of our other conference friends over for dinner the next night! Never underestimate the power of pie!

Our server was fine with doing separate checks, unfortunately a necessity when you&apos;ll be reimbursed for receipts."
5,"I came here with a local friend while in Chicago for a conference. Upon walking in, I felt like Gilt Bar was a popular restaurant with hidden secrets down the stairs -- which was right! 

Since it came so highly recommended, we shared the Truffle Pasta to start. It was a nice balance of truffle flavor without overpowering the pasta itself. You still get the flavor of the wheat noodles. Overall, one of the best preparations of truffle pasta I&apos;ve had. 

I followed that up with the Double Cut Coal-Fired Ribeye paired with a 2017 Sangiovese. Mmm mmm good. The ribeye was nearly falling apart; it was easy to cut with the fork alone. Brilliant. My friend also very much enjoyed her Pan Roasted Salmon. 

They have a cool and diverse cocktail menu that ranges from mules to martinis and negronis and more. Definitely an enjoyable experience! Don&apos;t miss the downstairs photo booth, which was a fun touch."
4,Came here for work dinner! I really liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. The steak tartare was delicious and a highlight! I tried one of the pastas for my dinner and it was mediocre. We all got espresso martinis for dessert and they were delicious. Recommend checking it out if you haven&apos;t been!  A little pricey but good quality.
5,Delicious pasta! I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and it was really good. We didn&apos;t order a salad but the waiter got our table confused with someone else&apos;s so they just gave it to us for free (we tried telling that it&apos;s not  ours but the waiter just left it on our table and walked away super quickly...). So initially we didn&apos;t even touch the food. And then another waitress came up to us and told us to just keep it. The salad was pretty decent too. I liked the speakeasy downstairs too. What a fun place!
5,"Really darn good food. We originally had a reservation for 9:30 on a Saturday night. Around 7pm we decided we couldn&apos;t wait any longer so stopped by to check the wait. It was an hour &amp; a half wait for inside, so we asked if we could sit outside even though it had rained earlier. They agreed and we had a table in 20 mins.

We ordered a variety of food including garlic appetizer, arugula salad, cheeseburger, prime rib sandwich, huge meatball, and cornbread. We shared all of the food and nothing was short of amazing.

Cannot wait to go back and try the pastas"
5,Love this place! Cute charm and the staff is always so great! Food is amazing. Try the chocolate cream pie!
4,"I got the Spicy Pork Rigatoni carry out. It was solid for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a 5 star pasta. 

When I went inside to get my order, the ambiance and decor seemed excellent. I suspect that this would be an incredible place to spend a night with friends.

I have no doubt that Gilt Bar could be a 5 star restaurant, but for me, I had a 4 star carry out experience."
5,Dinner here was amazing. The meatballs were definitely the highlight of the night--they are without a doubt the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. The toased garlic bread that came with the meatballs was equally delicious. The dining room is very low-lit and cultivates a really nice date vibe. There&apos;s also a photobooth in the basement which is fun! Gilt Bar is simply the perfect place for a dinner date.
5,"Of my 600+ Yelp reviews, I&apos;m going to guess at least 100 are for restaurants. Of those 100 restaurants, NOTHING compares to the Gilt Bar, and the Library downstairs, in terms of service!! I was blown away tonight, my first visit to the Gilt and the Library (the &apos;secret&apos; speakeasy located under the Gilt.) 

Other Yelpers have praised the delicious food, hearty cocktails, fabulous ambiance, and rich decor. All amazing. But what truly stood out tonight was the exceptional service from the hostesses, wait staff, bus staff, and bartenders. 

Tonight I celebrated a very special health-related occasion, my one-year anniversary of being cancer free. 3 staff members congratulated me! The waitress surprised me with a sparkler in my ice cream!!  And we were given a table in the library for cocktails after our meal. It was perfect. 

Oh, my friend forgot his left-overs upstairs in the Gilt Bar and when he went back to look for them, the to-go bag was gone. He was bummed but just shrugged it off, but then as we were leaving the Library after a round of cocktails, the waitress showed up at our table with a to-go bag. With a whole new order!! For free!! The chef made a whole new pasta dish and packaged it up to go!! That&apos;s incredible service!! Above and beyond. I can see why The Gilt and The Library are a hot ticket in Chicago. 

I can not wait to go back! Be sure to book in advance!! This is a super popular spot!!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe this place was so busy on a Tuesday night! We came in around 7 and were told it&apos;d be an hour long wait. Luckily, we were able to snag some couch seats in the bar area so we didn&apos;t have to wait that long. Because it was so busy though, our service took longer and was difficult to get ahold of. 

The table red wine was delicious and a great price surprisingly, so I had two glasses with my meal. I also had to try the famous cheeseburger, and was thoroughly impressed. It was huge, but I finished it because it was so deliciously tasty and tender! Definitely one of the top burgers I&apos;ve had in Chicago.

I love the atmosphere of this place and have still yet to try out the speakeasy. I also love the prices- I am definitely going to be coming back soon for this sexy restaurant atmosphere with amazing food!"
5,"Came here last Wednesday with a couple friends and really enjoyed it. I&apos;m a hogsalt truther (hogsalt does au cheval, bavette&apos;s, gilt bar, etc), so take my review with a grain of salt, but I definitely recommend checking this place out.

We started with the burrata, which was a good, smallish starter for the 4 of us.  The tomatoes were roasted really nicely and had a sweetness to them that I really enjoyed it. 

I ended up getting the orecchiette with spicy sausage for my main.  My girlfriend got the salmon.  The sausage was really good, and the orecchiette was cooked perfectly.  If I were to go again, I would probably try the truffle pasta, I saw it on another table and it looked really good. My girlfriend liked the salmon, it was cooked really well.  She said she would probably try something else next time, but we both really enjoyed our food.

I will say that I enjoy au cheval and bavette&apos;s a little more than gilt bar, but the fact that it&apos;s close is impressive.

Overall - 8.2/10, food is flavorful, service is awesome, and vibe is dark/romantic"
5,"Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a great place to celebrate. We had a reservation and were seated downstairs in the smaller and much quieter library portion, which we enjoyed. We were treated with a free champagne toast to start our meal since we were celebrating which was a great touch!

We started with the burrata which was very creamy and delicious, with good toast and roasted tomatoes. One of our favorite parts of the meal for sure.

We then shared two pastas, the truffle and the waiter recommended orecchiette. Both were awesome, the truffle pasta was nicely balanced and not overpowering with truffle, and the orecchiette was very tasty with a good kick to the sausage but not enough to make someone spice intolerant sweat.

We finished with the burger which I am told is almost the same as Au cheval but I haven&apos;t been there. It was a very good burger with thick bacon and juice running out with every bite. The fries are served with the same garlic aioli that they serve at small cheval which we also love.

Finished with the chocolate cream pie which exceeded my expectations, the Oreo crust and whipped cream definitely make the dish. 

Along they way we tried several drinks, including a well made bourbon Manhattan, a fantastic whiskey sour, and the French martini. 

Basically, everything we ordered was very good and we had a great experience. Would recommend to anybody."
5,"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city and definitely one of the first places I make a resie if a friend is in town visiting. I love that there&apos;s a separate vegetarian menu with tons of delicious options! The restaurant itself is dark and has a bit of an intimate and romantic feel. But, don&apos;t think that it isn&apos;t a great spot for a girls night, too! 

Their vodka sauce rigatoni and truffle bucatini are my absolute favorite pastas on the menu. The pastas are all shareable so get a few for the table to try different dishes. As an app, definitely get the roasted garlic in balsamic. It is served with some bread and is SO simple yet SO delicious!! I also love how robust their drink menu is - tons of options for old fashioned, martinis, etc. I still just get the dirty martini, but they do it so well. 

Overall, I love this place and will keep coming back! I highly recommend it - whether it&apos;s for a date night, girls night, or whatever occasion."
5,"Mmmm mmm! This place was recommended by a friend and I&apos;m glad I went!
I like that you can order a whole or half for the pasta....so you can leave room in your tummy for more food.
They also have another restaurant/bar/speakeasy downstairs. It&apos;s behind a hidden door. I recommend if you want some good Italian food."
5,"Returned here with my boyfriend when he came into town this past weekend. I was so impressed with how the staff handled our reservations. There was some stress as we had originally made a reso for Friday night and then when his flight was canceled for the crazy Chicago storms, we had to cancel. The only available reso for Saturday was 6 PM and his new flight came in 5:20 PM Saturday. The woman who was directing the main line worked with me/stayed in touch to help ensure we would still be seated at one of our favorite restaurants.

The long: Came here with a group of four friends and had a great experience from start to finish. We had a Friday 8pm reservation and were seated at a window seat immediately. Our waitress quickly came over with our drink menus which I always appreciate. I ordered the Spanish Old Fashioned which was really nice. It had a slight twist but was not too out of the ordinary. 

For appetizers we ordered the garlic, salmon cesar salad and the beef tartar. The salmon salad was delicious and I loved how you could order half portions of all the salads. The garlic oil and bread was good however I wish there was a greater clove to oil ratio. I did not try the tartar but the table loved it. 

For dinner we split the orecchiette and the truffle pasta. They were both super flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend both of these dishes. They are portioned very nice to split. We had also ordered the mashed potatoes but our waitress forget to bring them to the table which was fine with me since I was pleasantly full. 

Overall, Gilt bar is a wonderful place to share a couple of dishes with good friends. I would definitely return here in the near future

P.S. if you&apos;re reading this review, Josh, you&apos;re a true toastmaster"
5,"I love everything about Gilt Bar, and it&apos;s my go-to place for any special event, whether it&apos;s a birthday or a date night out. When I say I love everything, I literally mean everything--the food and drinks, impeccable service and ambiance, and the fact that they have a speakeasy and photo booth downstairs.

There&apos;s something for everyone on the menu here. But, I&apos;ve been here several times and I ALWAYS get the truffle pasta. The bucatini is perfectly al dente, and the truffle flavor is so strong. Other dishes I&apos;ve really enjoyed are the pappardelle, gnocchi, the giant meatball, brussel sprouts, and any dessert that comes with ice cream. They have the smoothest ice cream ever. If you get the single scoop ice cream, it actually comes with two scoops! The drinks here are great as well. I tend to like sweeter drinks more and have gotten the Airmail a couple of times as well as the Bee&apos;s Knees and Lillet Rose. Their negronis are great too.

The people here are always so attentive and accommodating, and the decor is beautiful.

Tip--even if you don&apos;t have a reservation for the Library speakeasy below the restaurant, you can ask the hostess about doing dessert and drinks there. They are usually super accommodating about it, and will schedule it in for you after dinner."
5,"Love love love this place. Can I emphasize it more? Great food, great pasta, big desserts, great drinks and great service. 5 stars all the way. Will definitely be back here. Get the lemon meringue and share with 5 people. Pasta is a must. Make reservations for sure as it is hard to get a table. They have a small bar where you can eat as well. Trust!!"
4,"This would be a great date spot! But I was there with friends and my cousin so not so much. The space is gorgeous though! Staff is friendly and way cooler than I will ever be, but that&apos;s OK because I left those feelings back in HS, right? Right.

I had a delicious old fashioned (bourbon) and the pasta with vodka sauce. We shared a lovely brie plate and then I had some delicious chocolate cream pie. In fact we had all the pies and my friend&apos;s photo of his lemon meringue brought some of our other conference friends over for dinner the next night! Never underestimate the power of pie!

Our server was fine with doing separate checks, unfortunately a necessity when you&apos;ll be reimbursed for receipts."
5,"I came here with a local friend while in Chicago for a conference. Upon walking in, I felt like Gilt Bar was a popular restaurant with hidden secrets down the stairs -- which was right! 

Since it came so highly recommended, we shared the Truffle Pasta to start. It was a nice balance of truffle flavor without overpowering the pasta itself. You still get the flavor of the wheat noodles. Overall, one of the best preparations of truffle pasta I&apos;ve had. 

I followed that up with the Double Cut Coal-Fired Ribeye paired with a 2017 Sangiovese. Mmm mmm good. The ribeye was nearly falling apart; it was easy to cut with the fork alone. Brilliant. My friend also very much enjoyed her Pan Roasted Salmon. 

They have a cool and diverse cocktail menu that ranges from mules to martinis and negronis and more. Definitely an enjoyable experience! Don&apos;t miss the downstairs photo booth, which was a fun touch."
4,Came here for work dinner! I really liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. The steak tartare was delicious and a highlight! I tried one of the pastas for my dinner and it was mediocre. We all got espresso martinis for dessert and they were delicious. Recommend checking it out if you haven&apos;t been!  A little pricey but good quality.
5,Delicious pasta! I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and it was really good. We didn&apos;t order a salad but the waiter got our table confused with someone else&apos;s so they just gave it to us for free (we tried telling that it&apos;s not  ours but the waiter just left it on our table and walked away super quickly...). So initially we didn&apos;t even touch the food. And then another waitress came up to us and told us to just keep it. The salad was pretty decent too. I liked the speakeasy downstairs too. What a fun place!
5,"Really darn good food. We originally had a reservation for 9:30 on a Saturday night. Around 7pm we decided we couldn&apos;t wait any longer so stopped by to check the wait. It was an hour &amp; a half wait for inside, so we asked if we could sit outside even though it had rained earlier. They agreed and we had a table in 20 mins.

We ordered a variety of food including garlic appetizer, arugula salad, cheeseburger, prime rib sandwich, huge meatball, and cornbread. We shared all of the food and nothing was short of amazing.

Cannot wait to go back and try the pastas"
5,Love this place! Cute charm and the staff is always so great! Food is amazing. Try the chocolate cream pie!
4,"I got the Spicy Pork Rigatoni carry out. It was solid for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a 5 star pasta. 

When I went inside to get my order, the ambiance and decor seemed excellent. I suspect that this would be an incredible place to spend a night with friends.

I have no doubt that Gilt Bar could be a 5 star restaurant, but for me, I had a 4 star carry out experience."
5,Dinner here was amazing. The meatballs were definitely the highlight of the night--they are without a doubt the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. The toased garlic bread that came with the meatballs was equally delicious. The dining room is very low-lit and cultivates a really nice date vibe. There&apos;s also a photobooth in the basement which is fun! Gilt Bar is simply the perfect place for a dinner date.
5,"Of my 600+ Yelp reviews, I&apos;m going to guess at least 100 are for restaurants. Of those 100 restaurants, NOTHING compares to the Gilt Bar, and the Library downstairs, in terms of service!! I was blown away tonight, my first visit to the Gilt and the Library (the &apos;secret&apos; speakeasy located under the Gilt.) 

Other Yelpers have praised the delicious food, hearty cocktails, fabulous ambiance, and rich decor. All amazing. But what truly stood out tonight was the exceptional service from the hostesses, wait staff, bus staff, and bartenders. 

Tonight I celebrated a very special health-related occasion, my one-year anniversary of being cancer free. 3 staff members congratulated me! The waitress surprised me with a sparkler in my ice cream!!  And we were given a table in the library for cocktails after our meal. It was perfect. 

Oh, my friend forgot his left-overs upstairs in the Gilt Bar and when he went back to look for them, the to-go bag was gone. He was bummed but just shrugged it off, but then as we were leaving the Library after a round of cocktails, the waitress showed up at our table with a to-go bag. With a whole new order!! For free!! The chef made a whole new pasta dish and packaged it up to go!! That&apos;s incredible service!! Above and beyond. I can see why The Gilt and The Library are a hot ticket in Chicago. 

I can not wait to go back! Be sure to book in advance!! This is a super popular spot!!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe this place was so busy on a Tuesday night! We came in around 7 and were told it&apos;d be an hour long wait. Luckily, we were able to snag some couch seats in the bar area so we didn&apos;t have to wait that long. Because it was so busy though, our service took longer and was difficult to get ahold of. 

The table red wine was delicious and a great price surprisingly, so I had two glasses with my meal. I also had to try the famous cheeseburger, and was thoroughly impressed. It was huge, but I finished it because it was so deliciously tasty and tender! Definitely one of the top burgers I&apos;ve had in Chicago.

I love the atmosphere of this place and have still yet to try out the speakeasy. I also love the prices- I am definitely going to be coming back soon for this sexy restaurant atmosphere with amazing food!"
5,"Came here last Wednesday with a couple friends and really enjoyed it. I&apos;m a hogsalt truther (hogsalt does au cheval, bavette&apos;s, gilt bar, etc), so take my review with a grain of salt, but I definitely recommend checking this place out.

We started with the burrata, which was a good, smallish starter for the 4 of us.  The tomatoes were roasted really nicely and had a sweetness to them that I really enjoyed it. 

I ended up getting the orecchiette with spicy sausage for my main.  My girlfriend got the salmon.  The sausage was really good, and the orecchiette was cooked perfectly.  If I were to go again, I would probably try the truffle pasta, I saw it on another table and it looked really good. My girlfriend liked the salmon, it was cooked really well.  She said she would probably try something else next time, but we both really enjoyed our food.

I will say that I enjoy au cheval and bavette&apos;s a little more than gilt bar, but the fact that it&apos;s close is impressive.

Overall - 8.2/10, food is flavorful, service is awesome, and vibe is dark/romantic"
5,"Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a great place to celebrate. We had a reservation and were seated downstairs in the smaller and much quieter library portion, which we enjoyed. We were treated with a free champagne toast to start our meal since we were celebrating which was a great touch!

We started with the burrata which was very creamy and delicious, with good toast and roasted tomatoes. One of our favorite parts of the meal for sure.

We then shared two pastas, the truffle and the waiter recommended orecchiette. Both were awesome, the truffle pasta was nicely balanced and not overpowering with truffle, and the orecchiette was very tasty with a good kick to the sausage but not enough to make someone spice intolerant sweat.

We finished with the burger which I am told is almost the same as Au cheval but I haven&apos;t been there. It was a very good burger with thick bacon and juice running out with every bite. The fries are served with the same garlic aioli that they serve at small cheval which we also love.

Finished with the chocolate cream pie which exceeded my expectations, the Oreo crust and whipped cream definitely make the dish. 

Along they way we tried several drinks, including a well made bourbon Manhattan, a fantastic whiskey sour, and the French martini. 

Basically, everything we ordered was very good and we had a great experience. Would recommend to anybody."
5,"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city and definitely one of the first places I make a resie if a friend is in town visiting. I love that there&apos;s a separate vegetarian menu with tons of delicious options! The restaurant itself is dark and has a bit of an intimate and romantic feel. But, don&apos;t think that it isn&apos;t a great spot for a girls night, too! 

Their vodka sauce rigatoni and truffle bucatini are my absolute favorite pastas on the menu. The pastas are all shareable so get a few for the table to try different dishes. As an app, definitely get the roasted garlic in balsamic. It is served with some bread and is SO simple yet SO delicious!! I also love how robust their drink menu is - tons of options for old fashioned, martinis, etc. I still just get the dirty martini, but they do it so well. 

Overall, I love this place and will keep coming back! I highly recommend it - whether it&apos;s for a date night, girls night, or whatever occasion."
5,"Mmmm mmm! This place was recommended by a friend and I&apos;m glad I went!
I like that you can order a whole or half for the pasta....so you can leave room in your tummy for more food.
They also have another restaurant/bar/speakeasy downstairs. It&apos;s behind a hidden door. I recommend if you want some good Italian food."
5,"Returned here with my boyfriend when he came into town this past weekend. I was so impressed with how the staff handled our reservations. There was some stress as we had originally made a reso for Friday night and then when his flight was canceled for the crazy Chicago storms, we had to cancel. The only available reso for Saturday was 6 PM and his new flight came in 5:20 PM Saturday. The woman who was directing the main line worked with me/stayed in touch to help ensure we would still be seated at one of our favorite restaurants. When we arrived close to 7, she seated us almost immediately. 

We were taken care of SO well and had our favorite- the bone marrow for appetizer, a dark &amp; stormy for me (Mule), an Old Fashioned for him, some delicious pasta, salmon, and another drink (on the house!). We were exceptionally pleased with how well we were treated, especially as it had been a very long week for both of us and we just wanted to relax &amp; decompress together.

All in all, the evening could not have been more lovely. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, the staff was attentive to our needs, and the ambiance/environment is second to none. Definitely come here if you need a romantic/softly lit/delicious restaurant for a date night."
5,"I like to get steak tartar whenever I see it on a menu (including Paris) and this is my favorite one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a huge serving, the egg is perfect, the bread is delicious. Must try!!"
4,"We came to Gilt Bar on a recommendation from a Chicago native - this is definitely a spot worth visiting!

The hostess seated us promptly for our 7:30 Friday reservation, which is easier said then done for many places. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I had a rye old fashioned to start, which was well-made and just what you expect from a cocktail bar. For food, I ended up going with the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Truffle Pasta. While my dish was very good, I had major food envy with the Truffle Pasta - the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the truffle was delicious. We saved some room for dessert and got the skillet cookie &amp; ice cream, which was more than enough for two people and provided a satisfying end to the meal.

The only downside to Gilt Bar was that we felt the lighting was too dim - I get trying to set a mood, but we had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu, even after our eyes adjusted. This was our only minor quibble with an otherwise great experience."

I tend to like sweeter drinks more and have gotten the Airmail a couple of times as well as the Bee&apos;s Knees and Lillet Rose. Their negronis are great too.

The people here are always so attentive and accommodating, and the decor is beautiful.

Tip--even if you don&apos;t have a reservation for the Library speakeasy below the restaurant, you can ask the hostess about doing dessert and drinks there. They are usually super accommodating about it, and will schedule it in for you after dinner."
5,"Love love love this place. Can I emphasize it more? Great food, great pasta, big desserts, great drinks and great service. 5 stars all the way. Will definitely be back here. Get the lemon meringue and share with 5 people. Pasta is a must. Make reservations for sure as it is hard to get a table. They have a small bar where you can eat as well. Trust!!"
4,"This would be a great date spot! But I was there with friends and my cousin so not so much. The space is gorgeous though! Staff is friendly and way cooler than I will ever be, but that&apos;s OK because I left those feelings back in HS, right? Right.

I had a delicious old fashioned (bourbon) and the pasta with vodka sauce. We shared a lovely brie plate and then I had some delicious chocolate cream pie. In fact we had all the pies and my friend&apos;s photo of his lemon meringue brought some of our other conference friends over for dinner the next night! Never underestimate the power of pie!

Our server was fine with doing separate checks, unfortunately a necessity when you&apos;ll be reimbursed for receipts."
5,"I came here with a local friend while in Chicago for a conference. Upon walking in, I felt like Gilt Bar was a popular restaurant with hidden secrets down the stairs -- which was right! 

Since it came so highly recommended, we shared the Truffle Pasta to start. It was a nice balance of truffle flavor without overpowering the pasta itself. You still get the flavor of the wheat noodles. Overall, one of the best preparations of truffle pasta I&apos;ve had. 

I followed that up with the Double Cut Coal-Fired Ribeye paired with a 2017 Sangiovese. Mmm mmm good. The ribeye was nearly falling apart; it was easy to cut with the fork alone. Brilliant. My friend also very much enjoyed her Pan Roasted Salmon. 

They have a cool and diverse cocktail menu that ranges from mules to martinis and negronis and more. Definitely an enjoyable experience! Don&apos;t miss the downstairs photo booth, which was a fun touch."
4,Came here for work dinner! I really liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. The steak tartare was delicious and a highlight! I tried one of the pastas for my dinner and it was mediocre. We all got espresso martinis for dessert and they were delicious. Recommend checking it out if you haven&apos;t been!  A little pricey but good quality.
5,Delicious pasta! I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and it was really good. We didn&apos;t order a salad but the waiter got our table confused with someone else&apos;s so they just gave it to us for free (we tried telling that it&apos;s not  ours but the waiter just left it on our table and walked away super quickly...). So initially we didn&apos;t even touch the food. And then another waitress came up to us and told us to just keep it. The salad was pretty decent too. I liked the speakeasy downstairs too. What a fun place!
5,"Really darn good food. We originally had a reservation for 9:30 on a Saturday night. Around 7pm we decided we couldn&apos;t wait any longer so stopped by to check the wait. It was an hour &amp; a half wait for inside, so we asked if we could sit outside even though it had rained earlier. They agreed and we had a table in 20 mins.

We ordered a variety of food including garlic appetizer, arugula salad, cheeseburger, prime rib sandwich, huge meatball, and cornbread. We shared all of the food and nothing was short of amazing.

Cannot wait to go back and try the pastas"
5,Love this place! Cute charm and the staff is always so great! Food is amazing. Try the chocolate cream pie!
4,"I got the Spicy Pork Rigatoni carry out. It was solid for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a 5 star pasta. 

When I went inside to get my order, the ambiance and decor seemed excellent. I suspect that this would be an incredible place to spend a night with friends.

I have no doubt that Gilt Bar could be a 5 star restaurant, but for me, I had a 4 star carry out experience."
5,Dinner here was amazing. The meatballs were definitely the highlight of the night--they are without a doubt the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. The toased garlic bread that came with the meatballs was equally delicious. The dining room is very low-lit and cultivates a really nice date vibe. There&apos;s also a photobooth in the basement which is fun! Gilt Bar is simply the perfect place for a dinner date.
5,"Of my 600+ Yelp reviews, I&apos;m going to guess at least 100 are for restaurants. Of those 100 restaurants, NOTHING compares to the Gilt Bar, and the Library downstairs, in terms of service!! I was blown away tonight, my first visit to the Gilt and the Library (the &apos;secret&apos; speakeasy located under the Gilt.) 

Other Yelpers have praised the delicious food, hearty cocktails, fabulous ambiance, and rich decor. All amazing. But what truly stood out tonight was the exceptional service from the hostesses, wait staff, bus staff, and bartenders. 

Tonight I celebrated a very special health-related occasion, my one-year anniversary of being cancer free. 3 staff members congratulated me! The waitress surprised me with a sparkler in my ice cream!!  And we were given a table in the library for cocktails after our meal. It was perfect. 

Oh, my friend forgot his left-overs upstairs in the Gilt Bar and when he went back to look for them, the to-go bag was gone. He was bummed but just shrugged it off, but then as we were leaving the Library after a round of cocktails, the waitress showed up at our table with a to-go bag. With a whole new order!! For free!! The chef made a whole new pasta dish and packaged it up to go!! That&apos;s incredible service!! Above and beyond. I can see why The Gilt and The Library are a hot ticket in Chicago. 

I can not wait to go back! Be sure to book in advance!! This is a super popular spot!!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe this place was so busy on a Tuesday night! We came in around 7 and were told it&apos;d be an hour long wait. Luckily, we were able to snag some couch seats in the bar area so we didn&apos;t have to wait that long. Because it was so busy though, our service took longer and was difficult to get ahold of. 

The table red wine was delicious and a great price surprisingly, so I had two glasses with my meal. I also had to try the famous cheeseburger, and was thoroughly impressed. It was huge, but I finished it because it was so deliciously tasty and tender! Definitely one of the top burgers I&apos;ve had in Chicago.

I love the atmosphere of this place and have still yet to try out the speakeasy. I also love the prices- I am definitely going to be coming back soon for this sexy restaurant atmosphere with amazing food!"
5,"Came here last Wednesday with a couple friends and really enjoyed it. I&apos;m a hogsalt truther (hogsalt does au cheval, bavette&apos;s, gilt bar, etc), so take my review with a grain of salt, but I definitely recommend checking this place out.

We started with the burrata, which was a good, smallish starter for the 4 of us.  The tomatoes were roasted really nicely and had a sweetness to them that I really enjoyed it. 

I ended up getting the orecchiette with spicy sausage for my main.  My girlfriend got the salmon.  The sausage was really good, and the orecchiette was cooked perfectly.  If I were to go again, I would probably try the truffle pasta, I saw it on another table and it looked really good. My girlfriend liked the salmon, it was cooked really well.  She said she would probably try something else next time, but we both really enjoyed our food.

I will say that I enjoy au cheval and bavette&apos;s a little more than gilt bar, but the fact that it&apos;s close is impressive.

Overall - 8.2/10, food is flavorful, service is awesome, and vibe is dark/romantic"
5,"Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a great place to celebrate. We had a reservation and were seated downstairs in the smaller and much quieter library portion, which we enjoyed. We were treated with a free champagne toast to start our meal since we were celebrating which was a great touch!

We started with the burrata which was very creamy and delicious, with good toast and roasted tomatoes. One of our favorite parts of the meal for sure.

We then shared two pastas, the truffle and the waiter recommended orecchiette. Both were awesome, the truffle pasta was nicely balanced and not overpowering with truffle, and the orecchiette was very tasty with a good kick to the sausage but not enough to make someone spice intolerant sweat.

We finished with the burger which I am told is almost the same as Au cheval but I haven&apos;t been there. It was a very good burger with thick bacon and juice running out with every bite. The fries are served with the same garlic aioli that they serve at small cheval which we also love.

Finished with the chocolate cream pie which exceeded my expectations, the Oreo crust and whipped cream definitely make the dish. 

Along they way we tried several drinks, including a well made bourbon Manhattan, a fantastic whiskey sour, and the French martini. 

Basically, everything we ordered was very good and we had a great experience. Would recommend to anybody."
5,"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city and definitely one of the first places I make a resie if a friend is in town visiting. I love that there&apos;s a separate vegetarian menu with tons of delicious options! The restaurant itself is dark and has a bit of an intimate and romantic feel. But, don&apos;t think that it isn&apos;t a great spot for a girls night, too! 

Their vodka sauce rigatoni and truffle bucatini are my absolute favorite pastas on the menu. The pastas are all shareable so get a few for the table to try different dishes. As an app, definitely get the roasted garlic in balsamic. It is served with some bread and is SO simple yet SO delicious!! I also love how robust their drink menu is - tons of options for old fashioned, martinis, etc. I still just get the dirty martini, but they do it so well. 

Overall, I love this place and will keep coming back! I highly recommend it - whether it&apos;s for a date night, girls night, or whatever occasion."
5,"Mmmm mmm! This place was recommended by a friend and I&apos;m glad I went!
I like that you can order a whole or half for the pasta....so you can leave room in your tummy for more food.
They also have another restaurant/bar/speakeasy downstairs. It&apos;s behind a hidden door. I recommend if you want some good Italian food."
5,"Returned here with my boyfriend when he came into town this past weekend. I was so impressed with how the staff handled our reservations. There was some stress as we had originally made a reso for Friday night and then when his flight was canceled for the crazy Chicago storms, we had to cancel. The only available reso for Saturday was 6 PM and his new flight came in 5:20 PM Saturday. The woman who was directing the main line worked with me/stayed in touch to help ensure we would still be seated at one of our favorite restaurants. When we arrived close to 7, she seated us almost immediately. 

We were taken care of SO well and had our favorite- the bone marrow for appetizer, a dark &amp; stormy for me (Mule), an Old Fashioned for him, some delicious pasta, salmon, and another drink (on the house!). We were exceptionally pleased with how well we were treated, especially as it had been a very long week for both of us and we just wanted to relax &amp; decompress together.

All in all, the evening could not have been more lovely. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, the staff was attentive to our needs, and the ambiance/environment is second to none. Definitely come here if you need a romantic/softly lit/delicious restaurant for a date night."
5,"I like to get steak tartar whenever I see it on a menu (including Paris) and this is my favorite one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a huge serving, the egg is perfect, the bread is delicious. Must try!!"
4,"We came to Gilt Bar on a recommendation from a Chicago native - this is definitely a spot worth visiting!

The hostess seated us promptly for our 7:30 Friday reservation, which is easier said then done for many places. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I had a rye old fashioned to start, which was well-made and just what you expect from a cocktail bar. For food, I ended up going with the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Truffle Pasta. While my dish was very good, I had major food envy with the Truffle Pasta - the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the truffle was delicious. We saved some room for dessert and got the skillet cookie &amp; ice cream, which was more than enough for two people and provided a satisfying end to the meal.

The only downside to Gilt Bar was that we felt the lighting was too dim - I get trying to set a mood, but we had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu, even after our eyes adjusted. This was our only minor quibble with an otherwise great experience."
5,"Yes! This place is so good. 

The short: expansive drink menu, reasonably priced delicious food, sultry ambiance and good service. 

The long: Came here with a group of four friends and had a great experience from start to finish. We had a Friday 8pm reservation and were seated at a window seat immediately. Our waitress quickly came over with our drink menus which I always appreciate. I ordered the Spanish Old Fashioned which was really nice. It had a slight twist but was not too out of the ordinary. 

For appetizers we ordered the garlic, salmon cesar salad and the beef tartar. The salmon salad was delicious and I loved how you could order half portions of all the salads. The garlic oil and bread was good however I wish there was a greater clove to oil ratio. I did not try the tartar but the table loved it. 

For dinner we split the orecchiette and the truffle pasta. They were both super flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend both of these dishes. They are portioned very nice to split. We had also ordered the mashed potatoes but our waitress forget to bring them to the table which was fine with me since I was pleasantly full. 

Overall, Gilt bar is a wonderful place to share a couple of dishes with good friends. I would definitely return here in the near future

P.S. if you&apos;re reading this review, Josh, you&apos;re a true toastmaster"
5,"I love everything about Gilt Bar, and it&apos;s my go-to place for any special event, whether it&apos;s a birthday or a date night out. When I say I love everything, I literally mean everything--the food and drinks, impeccable service and ambiance, and the fact that they have a speakeasy and photo booth downstairs.

There&apos;s something for everyone on the menu here. But, I&apos;ve been here several times and I ALWAYS get the truffle pasta. The bucatini is perfectly al dente, and the truffle flavor is so strong. Other dishes I&apos;ve really enjoyed are the pappardelle, gnocchi, the giant meatball, brussel sprouts, and any dessert that comes with ice cream. They have the smoothest ice cream ever.

Since it came so highly recommended, we shared the Truffle Pasta to start. It was a nice balance of truffle flavor without overpowering the pasta itself. You still get the flavor of the wheat noodles. Overall, one of the best preparations of truffle pasta I&apos;ve had. 

I followed that up with the Double Cut Coal-Fired Ribeye paired with a 2017 Sangiovese. Mmm mmm good. The ribeye was nearly falling apart; it was easy to cut with the fork alone. Brilliant. My friend also very much enjoyed her Pan Roasted Salmon. 

They have a cool and diverse cocktail menu that ranges from mules to martinis and negronis and more. Definitely an enjoyable experience! Don&apos;t miss the downstairs photo booth, which was a fun touch."
4,Came here for work dinner! I really liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. The steak tartare was delicious and a highlight! I tried one of the pastas for my dinner and it was mediocre. We all got espresso martinis for dessert and they were delicious. Recommend checking it out if you haven&apos;t been!  A little pricey but good quality.
5,Delicious pasta! I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and it was really good. We didn&apos;t order a salad but the waiter got our table confused with someone else&apos;s so they just gave it to us for free (we tried telling that it&apos;s not  ours but the waiter just left it on our table and walked away super quickly...). So initially we didn&apos;t even touch the food. And then another waitress came up to us and told us to just keep it. The salad was pretty decent too. I liked the speakeasy downstairs too. What a fun place!
5,"Really darn good food. We originally had a reservation for 9:30 on a Saturday night. Around 7pm we decided we couldn&apos;t wait any longer so stopped by to check the wait. It was an hour &amp; a half wait for inside, so we asked if we could sit outside even though it had rained earlier. They agreed and we had a table in 20 mins.

We ordered a variety of food including garlic appetizer, arugula salad, cheeseburger, prime rib sandwich, huge meatball, and cornbread. We shared all of the food and nothing was short of amazing.

Cannot wait to go back and try the pastas"
5,Love this place! Cute charm and the staff is always so great! Food is amazing. Try the chocolate cream pie!
4,"I got the Spicy Pork Rigatoni carry out. It was solid for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a 5 star pasta. 

When I went inside to get my order, the ambiance and decor seemed excellent. I suspect that this would be an incredible place to spend a night with friends.

I have no doubt that Gilt Bar could be a 5 star restaurant, but for me, I had a 4 star carry out experience."
5,Dinner here was amazing. The meatballs were definitely the highlight of the night--they are without a doubt the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. The toased garlic bread that came with the meatballs was equally delicious. The dining room is very low-lit and cultivates a really nice date vibe. There&apos;s also a photobooth in the basement which is fun! Gilt Bar is simply the perfect place for a dinner date.
5,"Of my 600+ Yelp reviews, I&apos;m going to guess at least 100 are for restaurants. Of those 100 restaurants, NOTHING compares to the Gilt Bar, and the Library downstairs, in terms of service!! I was blown away tonight, my first visit to the Gilt and the Library (the &apos;secret&apos; speakeasy located under the Gilt.) 

Other Yelpers have praised the delicious food, hearty cocktails, fabulous ambiance, and rich decor. All amazing. But what truly stood out tonight was the exceptional service from the hostesses, wait staff, bus staff, and bartenders. 

Tonight I celebrated a very special health-related occasion, my one-year anniversary of being cancer free. 3 staff members congratulated me! The waitress surprised me with a sparkler in my ice cream!!  And we were given a table in the library for cocktails after our meal. It was perfect. 

Oh, my friend forgot his left-overs upstairs in the Gilt Bar and when he went back to look for them, the to-go bag was gone. He was bummed but just shrugged it off, but then as we were leaving the Library after a round of cocktails, the waitress showed up at our table with a to-go bag. With a whole new order!! For free!! The chef made a whole new pasta dish and packaged it up to go!! That&apos;s incredible service!! Above and beyond. I can see why The Gilt and The Library are a hot ticket in Chicago. 

I can not wait to go back! Be sure to book in advance!! This is a super popular spot!!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe this place was so busy on a Tuesday night! We came in around 7 and were told it&apos;d be an hour long wait. Luckily, we were able to snag some couch seats in the bar area so we didn&apos;t have to wait that long. Because it was so busy though, our service took longer and was difficult to get ahold of. 

The table red wine was delicious and a great price surprisingly, so I had two glasses with my meal. I also had to try the famous cheeseburger, and was thoroughly impressed. It was huge, but I finished it because it was so deliciously tasty and tender! Definitely one of the top burgers I&apos;ve had in Chicago.

I love the atmosphere of this place and have still yet to try out the speakeasy. I also love the prices- I am definitely going to be coming back soon for this sexy restaurant atmosphere with amazing food!"
5,"Came here last Wednesday with a couple friends and really enjoyed it. I&apos;m a hogsalt truther (hogsalt does au cheval, bavette&apos;s, gilt bar, etc), so take my review with a grain of salt, but I definitely recommend checking this place out.

We started with the burrata, which was a good, smallish starter for the 4 of us.  The tomatoes were roasted really nicely and had a sweetness to them that I really enjoyed it. 

I ended up getting the orecchiette with spicy sausage for my main.  My girlfriend got the salmon.  The sausage was really good, and the orecchiette was cooked perfectly.  If I were to go again, I would probably try the truffle pasta, I saw it on another table and it looked really good. My girlfriend liked the salmon, it was cooked really well.  She said she would probably try something else next time, but we both really enjoyed our food.

I will say that I enjoy au cheval and bavette&apos;s a little more than gilt bar, but the fact that it&apos;s close is impressive.

Overall - 8.2/10, food is flavorful, service is awesome, and vibe is dark/romantic"
5,"Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a great place to celebrate. We had a reservation and were seated downstairs in the smaller and much quieter library portion, which we enjoyed. We were treated with a free champagne toast to start our meal since we were celebrating which was a great touch!

We started with the burrata which was very creamy and delicious, with good toast and roasted tomatoes. One of our favorite parts of the meal for sure.

We then shared two pastas, the truffle and the waiter recommended orecchiette. Both were awesome, the truffle pasta was nicely balanced and not overpowering with truffle, and the orecchiette was very tasty with a good kick to the sausage but not enough to make someone spice intolerant sweat.

We finished with the burger which I am told is almost the same as Au cheval but I haven&apos;t been there. It was a very good burger with thick bacon and juice running out with every bite. The fries are served with the same garlic aioli that they serve at small cheval which we also love.

Finished with the chocolate cream pie which exceeded my expectations, the Oreo crust and whipped cream definitely make the dish. 

Along they way we tried several drinks, including a well made bourbon Manhattan, a fantastic whiskey sour, and the French martini. 

Basically, everything we ordered was very good and we had a great experience. Would recommend to anybody."
5,"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city and definitely one of the first places I make a resie if a friend is in town visiting. I love that there&apos;s a separate vegetarian menu with tons of delicious options! The restaurant itself is dark and has a bit of an intimate and romantic feel. But, don&apos;t think that it isn&apos;t a great spot for a girls night, too! 

Their vodka sauce rigatoni and truffle bucatini are my absolute favorite pastas on the menu. The pastas are all shareable so get a few for the table to try different dishes. As an app, definitely get the roasted garlic in balsamic. It is served with some bread and is SO simple yet SO delicious!! I also love how robust their drink menu is - tons of options for old fashioned, martinis, etc. I still just get the dirty martini, but they do it so well. 

Overall, I love this place and will keep coming back! I highly recommend it - whether it&apos;s for a date night, girls night, or whatever occasion."
5,"Mmmm mmm! This place was recommended by a friend and I&apos;m glad I went!
I like that you can order a whole or half for the pasta....so you can leave room in your tummy for more food.
They also have another restaurant/bar/speakeasy downstairs. It&apos;s behind a hidden door. I recommend if you want some good Italian food."
5,"Returned here with my boyfriend when he came into town this past weekend. I was so impressed with how the staff handled our reservations. There was some stress as we had originally made a reso for Friday night and then when his flight was canceled for the crazy Chicago storms, we had to cancel. The only available reso for Saturday was 6 PM and his new flight came in 5:20 PM Saturday. The woman who was directing the main line worked with me/stayed in touch to help ensure we would still be seated at one of our favorite restaurants. When we arrived close to 7, she seated us almost immediately. 

We were taken care of SO well and had our favorite- the bone marrow for appetizer, a dark &amp; stormy for me (Mule), an Old Fashioned for him, some delicious pasta, salmon, and another drink (on the house!). We were exceptionally pleased with how well we were treated, especially as it had been a very long week for both of us and we just wanted to relax &amp; decompress together.

All in all, the evening could not have been more lovely. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, the staff was attentive to our needs, and the ambiance/environment is second to none. Definitely come here if you need a romantic/softly lit/delicious restaurant for a date night."
5,"I like to get steak tartar whenever I see it on a menu (including Paris) and this is my favorite one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a huge serving, the egg is perfect, the bread is delicious. Must try!!"
4,"We came to Gilt Bar on a recommendation from a Chicago native - this is definitely a spot worth visiting!

The hostess seated us promptly for our 7:30 Friday reservation, which is easier said then done for many places. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I had a rye old fashioned to start, which was well-made and just what you expect from a cocktail bar. For food, I ended up going with the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Truffle Pasta. While my dish was very good, I had major food envy with the Truffle Pasta - the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the truffle was delicious. We saved some room for dessert and got the skillet cookie &amp; ice cream, which was more than enough for two people and provided a satisfying end to the meal.

The only downside to Gilt Bar was that we felt the lighting was too dim - I get trying to set a mood, but we had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu, even after our eyes adjusted. This was our only minor quibble with an otherwise great experience."
5,"Yes! This place is so good. 

The short: expansive drink menu, reasonably priced delicious food, sultry ambiance and good service. 

The long: Came here with a group of four friends and had a great experience from start to finish. We had a Friday 8pm reservation and were seated at a window seat immediately. Our waitress quickly came over with our drink menus which I always appreciate. I ordered the Spanish Old Fashioned which was really nice. It had a slight twist but was not too out of the ordinary. 

For appetizers we ordered the garlic, salmon cesar salad and the beef tartar. The salmon salad was delicious and I loved how you could order half portions of all the salads. The garlic oil and bread was good however I wish there was a greater clove to oil ratio. I did not try the tartar but the table loved it. 

For dinner we split the orecchiette and the truffle pasta. They were both super flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend both of these dishes. They are portioned very nice to split. We had also ordered the mashed potatoes but our waitress forget to bring them to the table which was fine with me since I was pleasantly full. 

Overall, Gilt bar is a wonderful place to share a couple of dishes with good friends. I would definitely return here in the near future

P.S. if you&apos;re reading this review, Josh, you&apos;re a true toastmaster"
5,"I love everything about Gilt Bar, and it&apos;s my go-to place for any special event, whether it&apos;s a birthday or a date night out. When I say I love everything, I literally mean everything--the food and drinks, impeccable service and ambiance, and the fact that they have a speakeasy and photo booth downstairs.

There&apos;s something for everyone on the menu here. But, I&apos;ve been here several times and I ALWAYS get the truffle pasta. The bucatini is perfectly al dente, and the truffle flavor is so strong. Other dishes I&apos;ve really enjoyed are the pappardelle, gnocchi, the giant meatball, brussel sprouts, and any dessert that comes with ice cream. They have the smoothest ice cream ever. If you get the single scoop ice cream, it actually comes with two scoops! The drinks here are great as well. I tend to like sweeter drinks more and have gotten the Airmail a couple of times as well as the Bee&apos;s Knees and Lillet Rose. Their negronis are great too.

The people here are always so attentive and accommodating, and the decor is beautiful.

Tip--even if you don&apos;t have a reservation for the Library speakeasy below the restaurant, you can ask the hostess about doing dessert and drinks there. They are usually super accommodating about it, and will schedule it in for you after dinner."
5,"Love love love this place. Can I emphasize it more? Great food, great pasta, big desserts, great drinks and great service. 5 stars all the way. Will definitely be back here. Get the lemon meringue and share with 5 people. Pasta is a must. Make reservations for sure as it is hard to get a table. They have a small bar where you can eat as well. Trust!!"
4,"This would be a great date spot! But I was there with friends and my cousin so not so much. The space is gorgeous though! Staff is friendly and way cooler than I will ever be, but that&apos;s OK because I left those feelings back in HS, right? Right.

I had a delicious old fashioned (bourbon) and the pasta with vodka sauce. We shared a lovely brie plate and then I had some delicious chocolate cream pie. In fact we had all the pies and my friend&apos;s photo of his lemon meringue brought some of our other conference friends over for dinner the next night! Never underestimate the power of pie!

Our server was fine with doing separate checks, unfortunately a necessity when you&apos;ll be reimbursed for receipts."

It was an hour &amp; a half wait for inside, so we asked if we could sit outside even though it had rained earlier. They agreed and we had a table in 20 mins.

We ordered a variety of food including garlic appetizer, arugula salad, cheeseburger, prime rib sandwich, huge meatball, and cornbread. We shared all of the food and nothing was short of amazing.

Cannot wait to go back and try the pastas"
5,Love this place! Cute charm and the staff is always so great! Food is amazing. Try the chocolate cream pie!
4,"I got the Spicy Pork Rigatoni carry out. It was solid for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a 5 star pasta. 

When I went inside to get my order, the ambiance and decor seemed excellent. I suspect that this would be an incredible place to spend a night with friends.

I have no doubt that Gilt Bar could be a 5 star restaurant, but for me, I had a 4 star carry out experience."
5,Dinner here was amazing. The meatballs were definitely the highlight of the night--they are without a doubt the best I&apos;ve had in Chicago. The toased garlic bread that came with the meatballs was equally delicious. The dining room is very low-lit and cultivates a really nice date vibe. There&apos;s also a photobooth in the basement which is fun! Gilt Bar is simply the perfect place for a dinner date.
5,"Of my 600+ Yelp reviews, I&apos;m going to guess at least 100 are for restaurants. Of those 100 restaurants, NOTHING compares to the Gilt Bar, and the Library downstairs, in terms of service!! I was blown away tonight, my first visit to the Gilt and the Library (the &apos;secret&apos; speakeasy located under the Gilt.) 

Other Yelpers have praised the delicious food, hearty cocktails, fabulous ambiance, and rich decor. All amazing. But what truly stood out tonight was the exceptional service from the hostesses, wait staff, bus staff, and bartenders. 

Tonight I celebrated a very special health-related occasion, my one-year anniversary of being cancer free. 3 staff members congratulated me! The waitress surprised me with a sparkler in my ice cream!!  And we were given a table in the library for cocktails after our meal. It was perfect. 

Oh, my friend forgot his left-overs upstairs in the Gilt Bar and when he went back to look for them, the to-go bag was gone. He was bummed but just shrugged it off, but then as we were leaving the Library after a round of cocktails, the waitress showed up at our table with a to-go bag. With a whole new order!! For free!! The chef made a whole new pasta dish and packaged it up to go!! That&apos;s incredible service!! Above and beyond. I can see why The Gilt and The Library are a hot ticket in Chicago. 

I can not wait to go back! Be sure to book in advance!! This is a super popular spot!!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe this place was so busy on a Tuesday night! We came in around 7 and were told it&apos;d be an hour long wait. Luckily, we were able to snag some couch seats in the bar area so we didn&apos;t have to wait that long. Because it was so busy though, our service took longer and was difficult to get ahold of. 

The table red wine was delicious and a great price surprisingly, so I had two glasses with my meal. I also had to try the famous cheeseburger, and was thoroughly impressed. It was huge, but I finished it because it was so deliciously tasty and tender! Definitely one of the top burgers I&apos;ve had in Chicago.

I love the atmosphere of this place and have still yet to try out the speakeasy. I also love the prices- I am definitely going to be coming back soon for this sexy restaurant atmosphere with amazing food!"
5,"Came here last Wednesday with a couple friends and really enjoyed it. I&apos;m a hogsalt truther (hogsalt does au cheval, bavette&apos;s, gilt bar, etc), so take my review with a grain of salt, but I definitely recommend checking this place out.

We started with the burrata, which was a good, smallish starter for the 4 of us.  The tomatoes were roasted really nicely and had a sweetness to them that I really enjoyed it. 

I ended up getting the orecchiette with spicy sausage for my main.  My girlfriend got the salmon.  The sausage was really good, and the orecchiette was cooked perfectly.  If I were to go again, I would probably try the truffle pasta, I saw it on another table and it looked really good. My girlfriend liked the salmon, it was cooked really well.  She said she would probably try something else next time, but we both really enjoyed our food.

I will say that I enjoy au cheval and bavette&apos;s a little more than gilt bar, but the fact that it&apos;s close is impressive.

Overall - 8.2/10, food is flavorful, service is awesome, and vibe is dark/romantic"
5,"Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a great place to celebrate. We had a reservation and were seated downstairs in the smaller and much quieter library portion, which we enjoyed. We were treated with a free champagne toast to start our meal since we were celebrating which was a great touch!

We started with the burrata which was very creamy and delicious, with good toast and roasted tomatoes. One of our favorite parts of the meal for sure.

We then shared two pastas, the truffle and the waiter recommended orecchiette. Both were awesome, the truffle pasta was nicely balanced and not overpowering with truffle, and the orecchiette was very tasty with a good kick to the sausage but not enough to make someone spice intolerant sweat.

We finished with the burger which I am told is almost the same as Au cheval but I haven&apos;t been there. It was a very good burger with thick bacon and juice running out with every bite. The fries are served with the same garlic aioli that they serve at small cheval which we also love.

Finished with the chocolate cream pie which exceeded my expectations, the Oreo crust and whipped cream definitely make the dish. 

Along they way we tried several drinks, including a well made bourbon Manhattan, a fantastic whiskey sour, and the French martini. 

Basically, everything we ordered was very good and we had a great experience. Would recommend to anybody."
5,"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city and definitely one of the first places I make a resie if a friend is in town visiting. I love that there&apos;s a separate vegetarian menu with tons of delicious options! The restaurant itself is dark and has a bit of an intimate and romantic feel. But, don&apos;t think that it isn&apos;t a great spot for a girls night, too! 

Their vodka sauce rigatoni and truffle bucatini are my absolute favorite pastas on the menu. The pastas are all shareable so get a few for the table to try different dishes. As an app, definitely get the roasted garlic in balsamic. It is served with some bread and is SO simple yet SO delicious!! I also love how robust their drink menu is - tons of options for old fashioned, martinis, etc. I still just get the dirty martini, but they do it so well. 

Overall, I love this place and will keep coming back! I highly recommend it - whether it&apos;s for a date night, girls night, or whatever occasion."
5,"Mmmm mmm! This place was recommended by a friend and I&apos;m glad I went!
I like that you can order a whole or half for the pasta....so you can leave room in your tummy for more food.
They also have another restaurant/bar/speakeasy downstairs. It&apos;s behind a hidden door. I recommend if you want some good Italian food."
5,"Returned here with my boyfriend when he came into town this past weekend. I was so impressed with how the staff handled our reservations. There was some stress as we had originally made a reso for Friday night and then when his flight was canceled for the crazy Chicago storms, we had to cancel. The only available reso for Saturday was 6 PM and his new flight came in 5:20 PM Saturday. The woman who was directing the main line worked with me/stayed in touch to help ensure we would still be seated at one of our favorite restaurants. When we arrived close to 7, she seated us almost immediately. 

We were taken care of SO well and had our favorite- the bone marrow for appetizer, a dark &amp; stormy for me (Mule), an Old Fashioned for him, some delicious pasta, salmon, and another drink (on the house!). We were exceptionally pleased with how well we were treated, especially as it had been a very long week for both of us and we just wanted to relax &amp; decompress together.

All in all, the evening could not have been more lovely. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, the staff was attentive to our needs, and the ambiance/environment is second to none. Definitely come here if you need a romantic/softly lit/delicious restaurant for a date night."
5,"I like to get steak tartar whenever I see it on a menu (including Paris) and this is my favorite one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a huge serving, the egg is perfect, the bread is delicious. Must try!!"
4,"We came to Gilt Bar on a recommendation from a Chicago native - this is definitely a spot worth visiting!

The hostess seated us promptly for our 7:30 Friday reservation, which is easier said then done for many places. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I had a rye old fashioned to start, which was well-made and just what you expect from a cocktail bar. For food, I ended up going with the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Truffle Pasta. While my dish was very good, I had major food envy with the Truffle Pasta - the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the truffle was delicious. We saved some room for dessert and got the skillet cookie &amp; ice cream, which was more than enough for two people and provided a satisfying end to the meal.

The only downside to Gilt Bar was that we felt the lighting was too dim - I get trying to set a mood, but we had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu, even after our eyes adjusted. This was our only minor quibble with an otherwise great experience."
5,"Yes! This place is so good. 

The short: expansive drink menu, reasonably priced delicious food, sultry ambiance and good service. 

The long: Came here with a group of four friends and had a great experience from start to finish. We had a Friday 8pm reservation and were seated at a window seat immediately. Our waitress quickly came over with our drink menus which I always appreciate. I ordered the Spanish Old Fashioned which was really nice. It had a slight twist but was not too out of the ordinary. 

For appetizers we ordered the garlic, salmon cesar salad and the beef tartar. The salmon salad was delicious and I loved how you could order half portions of all the salads. The garlic oil and bread was good however I wish there was a greater clove to oil ratio. I did not try the tartar but the table loved it. 

For dinner we split the orecchiette and the truffle pasta. They were both super flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend both of these dishes. They are portioned very nice to split. We had also ordered the mashed potatoes but our waitress forget to bring them to the table which was fine with me since I was pleasantly full. 

Overall, Gilt bar is a wonderful place to share a couple of dishes with good friends. I would definitely return here in the near future

P.S. if you&apos;re reading this review, Josh, you&apos;re a true toastmaster"
5,"I love everything about Gilt Bar, and it&apos;s my go-to place for any special event, whether it&apos;s a birthday or a date night out. When I say I love everything, I literally mean everything--the food and drinks, impeccable service and ambiance, and the fact that they have a speakeasy and photo booth downstairs.

There&apos;s something for everyone on the menu here. But, I&apos;ve been here several times and I ALWAYS get the truffle pasta. The bucatini is perfectly al dente, and the truffle flavor is so strong. Other dishes I&apos;ve really enjoyed are the pappardelle, gnocchi, the giant meatball, brussel sprouts, and any dessert that comes with ice cream. They have the smoothest ice cream ever. If you get the single scoop ice cream, it actually comes with two scoops! The drinks here are great as well. I tend to like sweeter drinks more and have gotten the Airmail a couple of times as well as the Bee&apos;s Knees and Lillet Rose. Their negronis are great too.

The people here are always so attentive and accommodating, and the decor is beautiful.

Tip--even if you don&apos;t have a reservation for the Library speakeasy below the restaurant, you can ask the hostess about doing dessert and drinks there. They are usually super accommodating about it, and will schedule it in for you after dinner."
5,"Love love love this place. Can I emphasize it more? Great food, great pasta, big desserts, great drinks and great service. 5 stars all the way. Will definitely be back here. Get the lemon meringue and share with 5 people. Pasta is a must. Make reservations for sure as it is hard to get a table. They have a small bar where you can eat as well. Trust!!"
4,"This would be a great date spot! But I was there with friends and my cousin so not so much. The space is gorgeous though! Staff is friendly and way cooler than I will ever be, but that&apos;s OK because I left those feelings back in HS, right? Right.

I had a delicious old fashioned (bourbon) and the pasta with vodka sauce. We shared a lovely brie plate and then I had some delicious chocolate cream pie. In fact we had all the pies and my friend&apos;s photo of his lemon meringue brought some of our other conference friends over for dinner the next night! Never underestimate the power of pie!

Our server was fine with doing separate checks, unfortunately a necessity when you&apos;ll be reimbursed for receipts."
5,"I came here with a local friend while in Chicago for a conference. Upon walking in, I felt like Gilt Bar was a popular restaurant with hidden secrets down the stairs -- which was right! 

Since it came so highly recommended, we shared the Truffle Pasta to start. It was a nice balance of truffle flavor without overpowering the pasta itself. You still get the flavor of the wheat noodles. Overall, one of the best preparations of truffle pasta I&apos;ve had. 

I followed that up with the Double Cut Coal-Fired Ribeye paired with a 2017 Sangiovese. Mmm mmm good. The ribeye was nearly falling apart; it was easy to cut with the fork alone. Brilliant. My friend also very much enjoyed her Pan Roasted Salmon. 

They have a cool and diverse cocktail menu that ranges from mules to martinis and negronis and more. Definitely an enjoyable experience! Don&apos;t miss the downstairs photo booth, which was a fun touch."
4,Came here for work dinner! I really liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. The steak tartare was delicious and a highlight! I tried one of the pastas for my dinner and it was mediocre. We all got espresso martinis for dessert and they were delicious. Recommend checking it out if you haven&apos;t been!  A little pricey but good quality.
5,Delicious pasta! I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and it was really good. We didn&apos;t order a salad but the waiter got our table confused with someone else&apos;s so they just gave it to us for free (we tried telling that it&apos;s not  ours but the waiter just left it on our table and walked away super quickly...). So initially we didn&apos;t even touch the food. And then another waitress came up to us and told us to just keep it. The salad was pretty decent too. I liked the speakeasy downstairs too. What a fun place!

Tonight I celebrated a very special health-related occasion, my one-year anniversary of being cancer free. 3 staff members congratulated me! The waitress surprised me with a sparkler in my ice cream!!  And we were given a table in the library for cocktails after our meal. It was perfect. 

Oh, my friend forgot his left-overs upstairs in the Gilt Bar and when he went back to look for them, the to-go bag was gone. He was bummed but just shrugged it off, but then as we were leaving the Library after a round of cocktails, the waitress showed up at our table with a to-go bag. With a whole new order!! For free!! The chef made a whole new pasta dish and packaged it up to go!! That&apos;s incredible service!! Above and beyond. I can see why The Gilt and The Library are a hot ticket in Chicago. 

I can not wait to go back! Be sure to book in advance!! This is a super popular spot!!"
4,"I can&apos;t believe this place was so busy on a Tuesday night! We came in around 7 and were told it&apos;d be an hour long wait. Luckily, we were able to snag some couch seats in the bar area so we didn&apos;t have to wait that long. Because it was so busy though, our service took longer and was difficult to get ahold of. 

The table red wine was delicious and a great price surprisingly, so I had two glasses with my meal. I also had to try the famous cheeseburger, and was thoroughly impressed. It was huge, but I finished it because it was so deliciously tasty and tender! Definitely one of the top burgers I&apos;ve had in Chicago.

I love the atmosphere of this place and have still yet to try out the speakeasy. I also love the prices- I am definitely going to be coming back soon for this sexy restaurant atmosphere with amazing food!"
5,"Came here last Wednesday with a couple friends and really enjoyed it. I&apos;m a hogsalt truther (hogsalt does au cheval, bavette&apos;s, gilt bar, etc), so take my review with a grain of salt, but I definitely recommend checking this place out.

We started with the burrata, which was a good, smallish starter for the 4 of us.  The tomatoes were roasted really nicely and had a sweetness to them that I really enjoyed it. 

I ended up getting the orecchiette with spicy sausage for my main.  My girlfriend got the salmon.  The sausage was really good, and the orecchiette was cooked perfectly.  If I were to go again, I would probably try the truffle pasta, I saw it on another table and it looked really good. My girlfriend liked the salmon, it was cooked really well.  She said she would probably try something else next time, but we both really enjoyed our food.

I will say that I enjoy au cheval and bavette&apos;s a little more than gilt bar, but the fact that it&apos;s close is impressive.

Overall - 8.2/10, food is flavorful, service is awesome, and vibe is dark/romantic"
5,"Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a great place to celebrate. We had a reservation and were seated downstairs in the smaller and much quieter library portion, which we enjoyed. We were treated with a free champagne toast to start our meal since we were celebrating which was a great touch!

We started with the burrata which was very creamy and delicious, with good toast and roasted tomatoes. One of our favorite parts of the meal for sure.

We then shared two pastas, the truffle and the waiter recommended orecchiette. Both were awesome, the truffle pasta was nicely balanced and not overpowering with truffle, and the orecchiette was very tasty with a good kick to the sausage but not enough to make someone spice intolerant sweat.

We finished with the burger which I am told is almost the same as Au cheval but I haven&apos;t been there. It was a very good burger with thick bacon and juice running out with every bite. The fries are served with the same garlic aioli that they serve at small cheval which we also love.

Finished with the chocolate cream pie which exceeded my expectations, the Oreo crust and whipped cream definitely make the dish. 

Along they way we tried several drinks, including a well made bourbon Manhattan, a fantastic whiskey sour, and the French martini. 

Basically, everything we ordered was very good and we had a great experience. Would recommend to anybody."
5,"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city and definitely one of the first places I make a resie if a friend is in town visiting. I love that there&apos;s a separate vegetarian menu with tons of delicious options! The restaurant itself is dark and has a bit of an intimate and romantic feel. But, don&apos;t think that it isn&apos;t a great spot for a girls night, too! 

Their vodka sauce rigatoni and truffle bucatini are my absolute favorite pastas on the menu. The pastas are all shareable so get a few for the table to try different dishes. As an app, definitely get the roasted garlic in balsamic. It is served with some bread and is SO simple yet SO delicious!! I also love how robust their drink menu is - tons of options for old fashioned, martinis, etc. I still just get the dirty martini, but they do it so well. 

Overall, I love this place and will keep coming back! I highly recommend it - whether it&apos;s for a date night, girls night, or whatever occasion."
5,"Mmmm mmm! This place was recommended by a friend and I&apos;m glad I went!
I like that you can order a whole or half for the pasta....so you can leave room in your tummy for more food.
They also have another restaurant/bar/speakeasy downstairs. It&apos;s behind a hidden door. I recommend if you want some good Italian food."
5,"Returned here with my boyfriend when he came into town this past weekend. I was so impressed with how the staff handled our reservations. There was some stress as we had originally made a reso for Friday night and then when his flight was canceled for the crazy Chicago storms, we had to cancel. The only available reso for Saturday was 6 PM and his new flight came in 5:20 PM Saturday. The woman who was directing the main line worked with me/stayed in touch to help ensure we would still be seated at one of our favorite restaurants. When we arrived close to 7, she seated us almost immediately. 

We were taken care of SO well and had our favorite- the bone marrow for appetizer, a dark &amp; stormy for me (Mule), an Old Fashioned for him, some delicious pasta, salmon, and another drink (on the house!). We were exceptionally pleased with how well we were treated, especially as it had been a very long week for both of us and we just wanted to relax &amp; decompress together.

All in all, the evening could not have been more lovely. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, the staff was attentive to our needs, and the ambiance/environment is second to none. Definitely come here if you need a romantic/softly lit/delicious restaurant for a date night."
5,"I like to get steak tartar whenever I see it on a menu (including Paris) and this is my favorite one I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a huge serving, the egg is perfect, the bread is delicious. Must try!!"
4,"We came to Gilt Bar on a recommendation from a Chicago native - this is definitely a spot worth visiting!

The hostess seated us promptly for our 7:30 Friday reservation, which is easier said then done for many places. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I had a rye old fashioned to start, which was well-made and just what you expect from a cocktail bar. For food, I ended up going with the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Truffle Pasta. While my dish was very good, I had major food envy with the Truffle Pasta - the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the truffle was delicious. We saved some room for dessert and got the skillet cookie &amp; ice cream, which was more than enough for two people and provided a satisfying end to the meal.

The only downside to Gilt Bar was that we felt the lighting was too dim - I get trying to set a mood, but we had to use our phone flashlights to see the menu, even after our eyes adjusted. This was our only minor quibble with an otherwise great experience."
5,"Yes! This place is so good. 

The short: expansive drink menu, reasonably priced delicious food, sultry ambiance and good service. 

The long: Came here with a group of four friends and had a great experience from start to finish. We had a Friday 8pm reservation and were seated at a window seat immediately. Our waitress quickly came over with our drink menus which I always appreciate. I ordered the Spanish Old Fashioned which was really nice. It had a slight twist but was not too out of the ordinary. 

For appetizers we ordered the garlic, salmon cesar salad and the beef tartar. The salmon salad was delicious and I loved how you could order half portions of all the salads. The garlic oil and bread was good however I wish there was a greater clove to oil ratio. I did not try the tartar but the table loved it. 

For dinner we split the orecchiette and the truffle pasta. They were both super flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend both of these dishes. They are portioned very nice to split. We had also ordered the mashed potatoes but our waitress forget to bring them to the table which was fine with me since I was pleasantly full. 

Overall, Gilt bar is a wonderful place to share a couple of dishes with good friends. I would definitely return here in the near future

P.S. if you&apos;re reading this review, Josh, you&apos;re a true toastmaster"
5,"I love everything about Gilt Bar, and it&apos;s my go-to place for any special event, whether it&apos;s a birthday or a date night out. When I say I love everything, I literally mean everything--the food and drinks, impeccable service and ambiance, and the fact that they have a speakeasy and photo booth downstairs.

There&apos;s something for everyone on the menu here. But, I&apos;ve been here several times and I ALWAYS get the truffle pasta. The bucatini is perfectly al dente, and the truffle flavor is so strong. Other dishes I&apos;ve really enjoyed are the pappardelle, gnocchi, the giant meatball, brussel sprouts, and any dessert that comes with ice cream. They have the smoothest ice cream ever. If you get the single scoop ice cream, it actually comes with two scoops! The drinks here are great as well. I tend to like sweeter drinks more and have gotten the Airmail a couple of times as well as the Bee&apos;s Knees and Lillet Rose. Their negronis are great too.

The people here are always so attentive and accommodating, and the decor is beautiful.

Tip--even if you don&apos;t have a reservation for the Library speakeasy below the restaurant, you can ask the hostess about doing dessert and drinks there. They are usually super accommodating about it, and will schedule it in for you after dinner."
5,"Love love love this place. Can I emphasize it more? Great food, great pasta, big desserts, great drinks and great service. 5 stars all the way. Will definitely be back here. Get the lemon meringue and share with 5 people. Pasta is a must. Make reservations for sure as it is hard to get a table. They have a small bar where you can eat as well. Trust!!"
4,"This would be a great date spot! But I was there with friends and my cousin so not so much. The space is gorgeous though! Staff is friendly and way cooler than I will ever be, but that&apos;s OK because I left those feelings back in HS, right? Right.

I had a delicious old fashioned (bourbon) and the pasta with vodka sauce. We shared a lovely brie plate and then I had some delicious chocolate cream pie. In fact we had all the pies and my friend&apos;s photo of his lemon meringue brought some of our other conference friends over for dinner the next night! Never underestimate the power of pie!

Our server was fine with doing separate checks, unfortunately a necessity when you&apos;ll be reimbursed for receipts."
5,"I came here with a local friend while in Chicago for a conference. Upon walking in, I felt like Gilt Bar was a popular restaurant with hidden secrets down the stairs -- which was right! 

Since it came so highly recommended, we shared the Truffle Pasta to start. It was a nice balance of truffle flavor without overpowering the pasta itself. You still get the flavor of the wheat noodles. Overall, one of the best preparations of truffle pasta I&apos;ve had. 

I followed that up with the Double Cut Coal-Fired Ribeye paired with a 2017 Sangiovese. Mmm mmm good. The ribeye was nearly falling apart; it was easy to cut with the fork alone. Brilliant. My friend also very much enjoyed her Pan Roasted Salmon. 

They have a cool and diverse cocktail menu that ranges from mules to martinis and negronis and more. Definitely an enjoyable experience! Don&apos;t miss the downstairs photo booth, which was a fun touch."
4,Came here for work dinner! I really liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. The steak tartare was delicious and a highlight! I tried one of the pastas for my dinner and it was mediocre. We all got espresso martinis for dessert and they were delicious. Recommend checking it out if you haven&apos;t been!  A little pricey but good quality.
5,Delicious pasta! I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and it was really good. We didn&apos;t order a salad but the waiter got our table confused with someone else&apos;s so they just gave it to us for free (we tried telling that it&apos;s not  ours but the waiter just left it on our table and walked away super quickly...). So initially we didn&apos;t even touch the food. And then another waitress came up to us and told us to just keep it. The salad was pretty decent too. I liked the speakeasy downstairs too. What a fun place!
5,"Really darn good food. We originally had a reservation for 9:30 on a Saturday night. Around 7pm we decided we couldn&apos;t wait any longer so stopped by to check the wait. It was an hour &amp; a half wait for inside, so we asked if we could sit outside even though it had rained earlier. They agreed and we had a table in 20 mins.

We ordered a variety of food including garlic appetizer, arugula salad, cheeseburger, prime rib sandwich, huge meatball, and cornbread. We shared all of the food and nothing was short of amazing.

Cannot wait to go back and try the pastas"
